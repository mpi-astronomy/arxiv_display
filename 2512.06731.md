**Abstract:** Owing to hot and inflated envelopes that facilitate atmospheric studies, ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) have attracted much attention. Significant progress has been achieved, from enlarging the sample size to broadening the studies to encompass diverse stellar types and ages. Here, we present a transmission spectroscopy study of $\tar$ b, an UHJ orbiting a young A-type star, through high-resolution observations with CARMENES at the 3.5 m Calar Alto telescope. By using the line-by-line technique, we confirm the previous detections of H $\alpha$ , Na ${\sc i}$ , and Ca ${\sc ii}$ , report a new tentative detection of K ${\sc i}$ , and impose an upper limit on the He triplet absorption. Through cross-correlation analysis, we identify the Ca ${\sc ii}$ and Fe ${\sc i}$ absorptions, both blue-shifted by approximately $\rm 5 km s^{-1}$ , indicating a day-to-night side atmospheric wind. Additionally, we find a new tentative detection of K ${\sc i}$ . We do not see any significant atmospheric molecular signal in the near-infrared data. Putting $\tar$ b in the context of UHJs from the literature, it turns out that (1) H $\alpha$ absorption is more common on gas giants orbiting stars younger than 1 Gyr, with a relative detection probability of $P_{\rm Age<1 Gyr}({\rm H}\alpha)/P_{\rm Age\geq1 Gyr}({\rm H}\alpha)\sim 3$ ; (2) any UHJ is likely to exhibit Fe ${\sc i}$ absorption if it has Ca ${\sc ii}$ .

**Figure 7. -**  Residual maps and transmission spectra around H$\alpha$(_left_) and the He {\sc i} NIR triplet (_right_) lines. _Top panels_: Residual maps in the stellar rest frame. The time since mid-transit time ($T_c$) is shown on the vertical axis, wavelength is on the horizontal axis, and relative absorption is color-coded. Dashed blue horizontal lines indicate the transit duration. Dashed cyan tilted lines show the theoretical trace of the planetary signals. _Bottom panels_: Transmission spectra obtained combining all the spectra between the first and fourth contacts. We show the original data in light gray and the data binned by 0.2 Å in black. The best Gaussian fit model is shown in red along with its $1\sigma$ uncertainties (shaded red region). Dashed cyan vertical lines indicate the H$\alpha$(_left_) and the He {\sc i} triplet (_right_) lines positions. All wavelengths in this figure are given in vacuum.

    Distribution of H$\alpha$ observations for gas giants as function of stellar age vs. planetary radius (top panel), and period vs. radius diagram for $<$1 Gyr-old (bottom left panel) and $\ge$1 Gyr-old (bottom right panel) planets. $\tar$ b is labeled and marked with a blue star in the panels. Planets with detection of H$\alpha$ are marked with blue dots, while those with H$\alpha$ non-detections/upper limits are marked with red crosses. We indicate the 1 Gyr value with a dashed black horizontal line in the top panel. Results are retrieved from the ExoAtmospheres website.

**Figure 8. -**  Same as Figure \ref{Fig: TS Halpha Helium} but for the Na {\sc i} doublet lines (left panels) and K {\sc i}$\lambda$7701$\angstrom$(right panels). The white vertical bands are the masked regions due to interstellar medium absorption. Only a fit for Na {\sc i} D2 is presented. A shallow dip can be seen in the result of K {\sc i}, which might be due to atmospheric absorption.
