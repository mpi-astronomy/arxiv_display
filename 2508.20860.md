**Abstract:** We present $\HS$ , a novel \texttt{Python} code to generate $\Euclid$ realistic mock images in the $\HE$ , $\JE$ , $\YE$ , and $\IE$ photometric bands based on panchromatic $_ Hubble_$ Space Telescope observations.    The software was used to create a simulated database of $\Euclid$ images for the 27 galaxy clusters observed during the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with $_ Hubble_$ (CLASH) and the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) program. Since the mock images were generated from real observations, they incorporate, by construction, all the complexity of the observed galaxy clusters.    The simulated $\Euclid$ data of the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1 $-$ 2403 were then used to explore the possibility of developing strong lensing models based on the $\Euclid$ data. In this context, complementary photometric or spectroscopic follow-up campaigns are required to measure the redshifts of multiple images and cluster member galaxies. By Euclidising six parallel blank fields obtained during the HFF program, we provide an estimate of the number of galaxies detectable in $\Euclid$ images per ${\rm deg}^2$ per magnitude bin (number counts) and the distribution of the galaxy sizes. Finally, we present a preview of the $_ Chandra_$ Deep Field South that will be observed during the Euclid Deep Survey and two examples of galaxy-scale strong lensing systems residing in regions of the sky covered by the Euclid Wide Survey. The methodology developed in this work lends itself to several additional applications, as simulated $\Euclid$ fields based on HST (or JWST) imaging with extensive spectroscopic information can be used to validate the feasibility of legacy science cases or to train deep learning techniques in advance, thus preparing for a timely exploitation of the Euclid Survey data.

**Figure 1. -** Steps of the Euclidisation pipeline. In the top panel (a), we show the original _ Hubble_ F606W image of the galaxy cluster MACS J0416 at $z=0.396$. The bottom panel (e) shows the final simulated \IE band. The intermediate panels (b), (c), and (d), from top to bottom, illustrate: the convolution to match the \Euclid PSF, the result of combining the _ Hubble_ F606W and F814W filters to produce the \IE band, and the re-binning necessary to match the \Euclid pixel scale in the \IE band (see $\Sec$\ref{sec:pipeline}).

**Figure 5. -** Transmission curves of HST and \Euclid filters considered in this work. The five HST filters F606W, F814W, F105W, F125W, and F160W are shown with coloured solid lines, while the four \Euclid bands \IE, \YE, \JE, and \HE are represented by the coloured areas. The vertical black dashed lines indicate the wavelengths where the response of the HST F814W, F125W, and F160W filters begins to dominate over the F606W, F105W, and F125W filters, respectively.

**Figure 4. -** *Top panel*: Cumulative total mass profiles of MACS J0416 as derived from the B23, $\mathrm{EM_{spec}}$, and $\mathrm{EM_{phot}}$ strong lensing models. We show the results for the three models using dark grey, green, and red colours, respectively. The coloured bands indicate the 68.3\% confidence intervals. We also show the cumulative total mass profiles for the cluster member component (CM) using lighter colours. The radial distances are measured with respect to the BCG-N. We indicate the positions of multiple images and cluster members used in the \Euclid-based and B23 models with red and black vertical sticks at the top and bottom of the figure, respectively. *Bottom panel*: Ratios between the cumulative total mass profiles derived from the \Euclid-based and the B23 models. The coloured bands indicate the 68.3\% confidence intervals. (*fig:mass_profile*)
