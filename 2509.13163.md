**Abstract:** Local Universe dwarf galaxies are both cosmological and mass assembly probes. Deep surveys have enabled the study of these objects down to the low surface brightness (LSB) regime. In this paper, we estimate $\Euclid$ 's dwarf detection capabilities as well as limits of its MERge processing function (MER pipeline), responsible for producing the stacked mosaics and final catalogues. To do this, we inject mock dwarf galaxies in a real Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) field in the VIS band and compare the input catalogue to the final MER catalogue. The mock dwarf galaxies are generated with simple SÃ©rsic models and structural parameters extracted from observed dwarf galaxy property catalogues. To characterize the detected dwarfs, we use the mean surface brightness inside the effective radius ${\rm SB}_{\rm e}$ (in mag arcsec $^{-2}$ ). The final MER catalogues achieve completenesses of $91 \%$ for ${\rm SB}_{\rm e}\in[21,24]$ , and $54 \%$ for ${\rm SB}_{\rm e}\in[24,28]$ . These numbers do not take into account possible contaminants, including confusion with background galaxies at the location of the dwarfs. After taking into account those effects, they become respectively $86 \%$ and $38 \%$ . The MER pipeline performs a final local background subtraction with small mesh size, leading to a flux loss for galaxies with $R_{\rm e}>10\arcsec$ . By using the final MER mosaics and reinjecting this local background, we obtain an image in which we recover reliable photometric properties for objects under the arcminute scale. This background-reinjected product is thus suitable for the study of Local Universe dwarf galaxies. $\Euclid$ 's data reduction pipeline serves as a test bed for other deep surveys, particularly regarding background subtraction methods, a key issue in LSB science.

It is worth noting that the dwarfs in MER catalogues and those with $N_\sfont{SEARCH}>1$ are also detected by eye. In Appendix \ref{AppA}, we also provide the histogram of $\langle \mu_\sfont{I} \rangle$ as defined in \cite{Q1-SP001}. In this plot, all the dwarfs (nucleated or not) are included.

Only the non-nucleated dwarfs, at all distances, have been used in this analysis.  We labelled the number of dwarfs that are visually detected in each ${\rm SB}_{\rm e}$ bin. The dashed rectangle shows examples of objects that were detected differently with the various background treatments. (*fig:detection*)
