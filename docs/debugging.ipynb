      "\\abstract{We report the discovery of a remarkable Ly$\\alpha$ emitting galaxy at $z=7.278$, JADES-GS+53.16746-27.7720 (shortened to JADES-GS-z7-LA), with EW$_0$(Ly$\\alpha$) $\\approx400 \\pm 90$ Å and UV magnitude $-16.7$. The spectroscopic redshift is confirmed via rest-frame optical lines [O \\textsc{ii}], H$\\beta$ and [O \\textsc{iii}] in its JWST/NIRSpec Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) spectrum. The Ly$\\alpha$ line is detected in both lower resolution ($R\\sim100$) PRISM as well as medium resolution ($R\\sim1000$) G140M grating spectra. The Ly$\\alpha$ FWHM in the grating is $\\approx360$ km s$^{-1}$ and the line peaks with[O \\textsc{ii}]in $120$ km s$^{-1}$ of the systemic redshift, indicative of very little neutral gas or dust within the galaxy. We estimate the Ly$\\alpha$ escape fraction to be $\\sim100\\%$. JADES-GS-z7-LA has a [O \\textsc{iii}]/[O \\textsc{ii}] ratio (O32) of $8.8 \\pm 1.1$ and ([O \\textsc{iii}]+[O \\textsc{ii}])/H$\\beta$ ratio (R23) of $9.6\\pm2.2$, consistent with low metallicity and high ionization parameters. Deep NIRCam imaging also revealed a close companion source (separated by $0.23\"$), which exhibits similar photometry to that of JADES-GS-z7-LA, with a photometric excess in the F410M NIRCam image consistent with [O \\textsc{iii}]+H$\\beta$ emission at the same redshift. The spectral energy distribution of JADES-GS-z7-LA indicates a `bursty' star-formation history, with a low stellar mass of $10^{7.15}$ M$_\\odot$. The only explanation of the high EW Ly$\\alpha$ emission seen in JADES-GS-z7-LA is if it resides in an ionized bubble with radius $\\gtrsim 3$ pMpc. Owing to the faint nature of JADES-GS-z7-LA, we show that it is incapable of single-handedly ionizing a bubble large enough. Therefore, we suggest that JADES-GS-z7-LA (and possibly the companion source) may be a part of a larger overdensity, presenting direct evidence of overlapping ionized bubbles at $z>7$, allowing us to study the process of reionization across both small and large scales.}\n",

      "\\label{sec:intro}\n",
      "Understanding the key drivers of cosmic reionization - an important phase transition in the Universe's lifetime whereby the intergalactic medium (IGM) transformed from neutral to completely ionized by $z\\sim6$ - is an important challenge in observational astronomy \\citep[see][for a recent review]{rob22a}. This requires good estimates on the rate of hydrogen ionizing Lyman continuum (LyC; $\\lambda_0 < 912$ Å) photons that are produced within galaxies, as well as the fraction of these that are able to escape from galaxies, contributing towards reionization of the IGM \\citep{day18}.\n",
      "Although early data from the \\emph{James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)} has already provided unprecedented insights into the interstellar medium (ISM) conditions and ionizing photon production in reionization era galaxies at $z>6$ \\citep{curtis22, rob22, end22b, cur23, kat23b, arr22, tru22, tac22, sun22, san23, fuj23, cam23}, placing direct constraints on the escape fraction of LyC photons (\\fesc) is impossible at $z>6$ because of the increasing neutrality of the IGM that absorbs virtually all LyC photons along the line of sight \\citep[e.g.][]{ino14}. Even so, there are indirect indicators of LyC \\fesc that could potentially be used to estimate ionizing photon escape using \\emph{JWST} data \\citep[e.g.][]{zac13, top22, mas23}.\n",
      "However, as individual galaxies or groups of galaxies begin to reionize their immediate surroundings, the ionized `bubbles' will eventually grow large enough to allow the \\lya photons to escape along the line of sight without considerable absorption, so long as they have been sufficiently redshifted out of \\lya resonance \\citep{mir98, fur06, mason20, tra22}. By then studying the strength and extent of \\lya emission from individual galaxies at $z>6$ as well as by studying the evolution of the fraction of LAEs as a function of redshift, accurate constraints can be placed on the evolving neutral fraction of the IGM \\citep{mal06, pen11, pen14, zit15, fur16, sta17, til20, jun20, whi20, hu21, cas18, cas22, end22a}, where a careful modelling of the fraction of galaxies with \\lya emission can give constraints on the evolution of the neutral fraction of the IGM across redshifts \\citep[e.g.][]{mes15, mas18, mason20, mor21, bol22, qin22, mat22, tra22}. The spatial distribution and associations of these \\lya emitting galaxies can give further insights into whether reionization proceeds uniformly across the Universe or in a patchy manner \\citep[e.g.][]{lar22, leo22, tan23}.\n",
      "Before \\emph{JWST}, \\lya observations were mostly attempted from the ground \\citep[e.g.][]{van11, pen14, oes15, fur16, sta17, lap17, roberts22}, and as a result, were restricted to some of the brightest known galaxies at $z>6$. These bright galaxies are good beacons of ionized bubbles in the Universe, as they would have undergone intense star-formation activity that would eventually lead to the inflation of a bubble large enough for \\lya emission to pass through \\citep[e.g.][]{mad99}. However, such galaxies are rare, and according to models of reionization the bulk of the photons ionizing the IGM must come from the more numerous fainter, lower mass galaxies at $z>6$ \\citep[e.g.][]{rob15, fin19}. Therefore, it is vital to begin assembling a picture of \\lya emission and transmission from fainter UV galaxies to better understand both their role in driving reionization as well as the impact of the surroundings within which these fainter galaxies may exist, in addition to covering several more independent sightlines to gain a more complete picture of the spatial and temporal evolution of reionization.\n",
      "Spectroscopic follow-up of faint high redshift galaxy candidates in well-studied extragalactic fields with \\emph{JWST} now offers an excellent opportunity to investigate the presence of \\lya emission in such sources at $z>6$. In this paper, we leverage the power of the \\emph{JWST} Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) and present the discovery of a very faint galaxy spectroscopically confirmed at $z=7.3$. The aim of this paper is to constrain both the ISM conditions and ionization properties of the \\lya emitting galaxy as well as characterize the state of the IGM around it, making inferences on its implications for the reionization of the Universe.\n",
      "The layout of this paper is as follows: Section \\ref{sec:data} describes the \\emph{JWST} data used in this study. Section \\ref{sec:lae} presents details about the observed properties of the remarkable LAE at $z=7.278$, JADES-GS+53.16746-27.77201, shortened to JADES-GS-z7-LA, which forms the main focus of this paper. Section \\ref{sec:SED} contains details of modelling the spectral energy distribution (SED), leading to stronger constraints on the physical parameters of the galaxy. Section \\ref{sec:reionization} discusses the implications for the reionization of the Universe from these observations. The conclusions are presented in Section \\ref{sec:conclusions}.\n",
      "Throughout this paper, we use the \\citet{planck} cosmology. Magnitudes are in the AB system \\citep{oke83} and all distances used are proper distances, unless otherwise stated.\n",
      "\\section{Data}\n",
      "\\label{sec:data}\n",
      "JADES-GS+53.16746-27.77201 was first reported in \\citet{mcl13} and \\citet{sch13} as a high redshift galaxy candidate using \\emph{HST} imaging in the HUDF with ID UDF12-4019-6190 and a photometric redshift of $z_{\\rm{phot}}=6.9$. Being a high redshift candidate, this object was included in JADES NIRSpec and NIRCam observations that are described below.\n",
      "The JWST observations used in this study are part of JADES, which is a collaboration between the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam; \\citealt{rie22}) and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec; \\citealt{fer22}) Instrument Science teams with an aim of using over 750 hours of guaranteed time observations (GTO) to study the evolution of galaxies in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS)-South and GOODS-North fields. We describe the NIRSpec and NIRCam observations and data reduction steps that led to the discovery of JADES-GS-z7-LA below.\n",
      "\\subsection{NIRSpec spectroscopy}\n",
      "The NIRSpec observations used here are part of the GTO program ID: 1210 (PI: Lützgendorf) in GOODS-S, using the Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA; \\citealt{jak22, fer22}) centred near the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), obtained between 22 October and 25 October 2022 over 3 visits. Each visit had a total of 33,613 seconds of exposure in the PRISM/CLEAR setup, which gives wavelength coverage in the range $0.6-5.3$ $\\mu$m with a spectral resolution of $R\\sim100$ \\citep{bok23}, and 8,403 seconds integration in each of G140M/F070LP, G235M/F170LP, G395M/F290LP, and G395H/F290LP filter/grating setups. We refer the readers to \\citet{curtis22} and \\citet{cam23} for further details about the observational setup.\n",
      "The targets for spectroscopy were selected from existing deep \\textit{HST} imaging and catalogues in the field. Candidate high redshift galaxies with photometric redshifts $z>5.7$, identified via the classic photometric \\lq drop-out' technique \\citep[e.g.][]{ste96}, whereby the Lyman break in the spectrum of a galaxy is captured in adjacent broad-band filters, were assigned higher priorities. Full details of the target selection and priority classes will follow in a separate publication (Bunker et al. in prep).\n",
      "As also mentioned in \\citet{cam23}, each of the three visits were slightly offset ($<1$\") and had a unique MSA configuration, with target allocation optimized to achieve coverage of the highest priority targets across multiple visits. JADES-GS-z7-LA was covered in 2 out of the 3 visits, which meant that it had a total exposure time of 18.7 hours in PRISM/CLEAR and 4.7 hours in each of the mid/high resolution filter/grating setups. For each visit, a three-point nodding pattern was used for background subtraction.\n",
      "The data reduction was carried out using pipelines developed by the ESA NIRSpec Science Operations Team (SOT) and the NIRSpec GTO Team \\citep{fer22}. Some of the  main data reduction steps implemented by the pipeline are pixel-level background subtraction, pixel-to-pixel flat-field correction, absolute flux calibration, slit-loss correction, and eventually 2D and 1D spectra extraction and co-addition. In this version of the reduction, the final 1D spectra are not extracted from the 2D spectra, but result from the weighted averaging of 1D spectra from all integrations \\citep[see][]{curtis22}. Due to the compact size of JADES-GS-z7-LA, slit-loss corrections were applied by modelling it as point-like source. A nominal 3-pixel extraction aperture was used to produce the co-added 1D spectra. A detailed description of the data reduction and spectral extraction methods is given in \\citet{curtis22} and \\citet{cam23}.\n",
      "\\subsection{NIRCam imaging}\n",
      "The  NIRCam data used in this study are part of the GTO program ID: 1180 (PI: Eisenstein) in GOODS-S, obtained between 29 September and 5 October 2022. A detailed description of the observations and data reduction can be found in \\citet{rob22} and \\citet{tac23}, but here we briefly describe the methodology to obtain NIRCam images.\n",
      "Four pointings centred at or around the HUDF were used to produce a $4.4 \\times 6$ arcminute mosaic. The filters used for these observations were F090W, F115W, F150W and F200W in the short-wavelength (SW) channel, and F277W, F335M, F356W, F410M and F444W in the long-wavelength (LW) channel. Individual exposures of 1375 seconds were used in a nine-point dither pattern in all four pointings.\n",
      "The JWST Calibration Pipeline v1.8.1 was used for data reduction, where the main reduction steps involved in the production of Stage-1 products were dark subtraction, distortion correction, bad-pixel masking, bias subtraction, and `snowball' removal \\citep{bir22}. The Stage-2 processing included flat-fielding and flux calibration. Astrometric alignment was then performed using a custom version of JWST TweakReg. Full details of the NIRCam data reduction and mosaicing will be presented in a forthcoming paper (Tachella et al. in prep) and more details of the basic reduction steps can already be found in \\citet{rob22} and \\citet{tac23}.\n",

We show the combined 1D and 2D spectra in Figure \\ref{fig:R100_spec}, with zoom-ins around the wavelengths covering \\lya and \\oiii+\\hb lines. With the measured spectroscopic redshift, we find that the absolute UV magnitude (at $1500$ Å rest-frame) is $-16.7$.\n",
      "Below we present both spectroscopic as well as photometric measurements for this remarkable LAE, placing constraints on dust and the star-formation rate based on spectroscopic observations. We also present the discovery of a previously unknown Lyman break galaxy very close to JADES-GS-z7-LA.\n",

      "As seen in Figure \\ref{fig:R100_spec}, the continuum is not well detected in the PRISM R100 spectrum, however, the \\lya emission line is detected both in 1D and 2D spectra. The \\lya line is also clearly detected in the G140M grating spectrum, which corresponds to a spectral resolution of $R\\sim1000$ (Figure \\ref{fig:R1000_spec}). In this paper, we use the \\lya line flux measured from the R1000 spectrum, as the spectral resolution in the lower resolution PRISM spectrum is dramatically reduced at shorter wavelengths.\n",
      "We fit a single Gaussian to the emission line in the R1000 spectrum, using an extrapolation of the fluxes in the F115W, F150W and F200W bands from NIRCam to estimate the continuum around the line, which we find to also be consistent with the best-fitting SED (details in Section \\ref{sec:SED}). We measure a \\lya line flux of $2.36 \\pm 0.25\\times 10^{-18}$ \\flux, giving a rest-frame equivalent width of EW$_0 = 400.1 \\pm 90.2$ Å, making it one of the highest EW \\lya emitting galaxies currently known in the epoch of reionization \\cite[see][for a comparison]{tan23}.\n",

      "The \\lya line has a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of $414$ \\kms in the R1000 spectrum. For a point source in the centre of the shutter, the line spread function (LSF) at $\\sim1.0$ micron is $208$ \\kms (De Graaff et al. in prep), which gives a LSF-deconvolved FWHM of $358$ \\kms. Perhaps the most striking feature is the symmetric \\lya line profile, with the peak of the line having only a marginal velocity shift of $\\sim120\\pm80$ km/s (corresponding to the width of the spectral pixel) compared to the systemic redshift of the galaxy (Figure \\ref{fig:R1000_spec}), measured from the \\oiii and \\hb lines. We note here that there may be additional uncertainties introduced due to small offsets in the wavelength calibration between the low and medium resolution spectra, but unfortunately no other emission line is detected in the G140M spectrum to compare against.\n",
      "In Figure \\ref{fig:vel_comp} we show the distribution of the \\lya EW and the observed offset from the systemic redshift for JADES-GS-z7-LA, compared with the recently discovered \\lya emission from GN-z11 \\citep{bun23} and measurements from other $z>7$ galaxies \\citep{tan23, end22c}. The points have been color-coded by their absolute UV magnitudes. The distribution displays a strong anti-correlation between \\lya EW and velocity offset from the systemic redshift, whereby UV-brighter galaxies also tend to show larger velocity offsets. Figure \\ref{fig:vel_comp} also demonstrates the extremely high \\lya EW as well as faint continuum of JADES-GS-z7-LA compared to other known LAEs at $z>7$.\n",
      "Such high \\lya line strengths and narrow \\lya profiles peaking close to the systemic redshift are often indicative of the presence of low column density channels in the neutral gas surrounding H \\textsc{ii} regions, or very little neutral gas, which enables the escape of \\lya photons without considerable absorption and scattering out of the line-of-sight \\citep[see][for example]{ver17}.

We derive a $1\\sigma$ upper limit of \\hg/\\hb$<0.49$, which is consistent with expectations from Case B recombination for an electron density, $n_e = 100$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures of up to 20,000 K \\citep{dop03, ost06}.

      "This limit, unfortunately, is not useful to place constraints on the dust attenuation in the galaxy spectrum. However, given the extremely high equivalent width of the \\lya line combined with the narrow profile peaking close to the systemic redshift, one might expect there to be little to no dust in the system, which enables \\lya photons to escape along the line of sight evading dust absorption. We also infer a UV slope of $\\beta = -2.1 \\pm 0.2$ from both the NIRCam photometry, binning of the PRISM spectrum and best-fitting SED (details in Section \\ref{sec:SED}), which suggests a relatively dust-free environment.\n",

      "\\subsection{Lyman-alpha escape fraction}\n",
      "\\label{sec:lya_escape}\n",
      "Using Balmer emission lines, it is possible to derive an escape fraction for \\lya under certain assumptions. For example, assuming Case B recombination, i.e. no LyC photon escape from the galaxy and a dust free environment, $n_e = 300$ cm$^{-3}$ and $T_e = 15,000$ K, the expected \\lya/\\hb ratio is $24.5$ \\citep[e.g.][]{ost89}. The \\fesc(\\lya) can then be calculated as: \\fesc(\\lya) = L(\\lya)/($24.5 \\times $L(\\hb)). Under these assumptions, we find \\fesc(\\lya) $= 0.96 \\pm 0.22$, which is consistent with complete \\lya escape, expected in a dust-free environment \\citep[e.g.][]{dij16}. A $\\sim100\\%$ \\lya escape fraction was also reported for a LyC leaking galaxy in the local Universe by \\citet{izo18a}, which also had a LyC escape fraction of \\fesc(LyC) $\\approx0.46$.\n",
      "We note, however, that Case B recombination may not be necessarily valid for galaxies that may be leaking a significant amount of LyC photons through an optically thin ISM, where Case A recombination is more appropriate. In Case A, it is possible to achieve $\\sim1.5\\times$ higher \\lya/\\hb ratios, due to the effective recombination coefficient of Balmer series transitions being $\\approx1.5$ times higher compared to Case B. Using a $1.5\\times$ intrinsic ratio following Case A, we would still infer a relatively high \\fesc(\\lya) $\\approx0.64 \\pm 0.15$.\n",
      "We also note that the intrinsic \\lya/\\hb ratio is more sensitive to the assumed electron density than temperature. For example, assuming $n_e = 5000$ cm$^{-3}$ (using {\\sc pyneb}) can increase the intrinsic ratio to $\\approx30$, leading to lower \\fesc(\\lya). We also note that the inclusion of any dust correction in this calculation will actually increase the observed \\lya/\\hb ratio, leading to even higher \\fesc(\\lya).\n",
      "Several studies in the literature, both using theory and observations, have attempted to link the leakage of LyC photons to \\lya escape \\citep[e.g.][]{mar18, gaz20, izo21}, \\lya luminosities \\citep[e.g.][]{maj22} and \\lya line profiles \\citep[e.g.][]{ver17, nai22}. Based on the high \\fesc(\\lya) and its line profile, it is not unreasonable to expect that JADES-GS-z7-LA is leaking a significant amount of LyC radiation. In the following section, we investigate indications of LyC leakage using other spectroscopic and photometric indicators.\n",
      "\\subsection{Indications of Lyman continuum leakage from JADES-GS-z7-LA?}\n",
      "Although \\emph{JWST} imaging and spectroscopy has now made it relatively easy to measure the distribution of UV luminosities and \\xiion of galaxies in the reionization era, placing accurate constraints on \\fesc remains a big challenge as no direct measurements of LyC emission are possible beyond $z>4$ \\citep{ino14}. The shape and the strength of \\lya emission from galaxies can help trace Lyman continuum leakage -- in particular, a double peaked \\lya profile with transmission of flux bluewards of the systemic redshift, or a small shift ($v \\leq 150$ \\kms) in the peak of a single \\lya emission line compared to the systemic redshift can trace physical conditions representative of low column density of neutral gas \\citep{ver15}.\n",
      "There are several other spectroscopic indicators of LyC \\fesc proposed in the literature, including high O32 ratios \\citep[e.g.][]{fai16}, low covering fractions of low ionization interstellar absorption features (\\citealt{hec01}; see e.g. \\citet{sal22} and references therein for more recent works) and the presence of high ionization emission lines \\citep[e.g.][]{sch22a, sax22b}. Steep rest-frame UV slopes as well as reduced strengths of rest-frame nebular emission lines have also been suggested as tracers of significant LyC leakage \\citep[e.g.][]{top22}.\n",
      "JADES-GS-z7-LA is one of the highest EW LAEs currently known in the reionization epoch with rest-frame EW of $\\approx415$ Å, and a narrow (unresolved) Gaussian emission line profile (at $R\\sim1000$), which is only offset from its systemic redshift by $\\approx120$ \\kms (Figure \\ref{fig:R1000_spec}). Based on its \\lya properties, and in particular the high \\fesc(\\lya) and its correlation with \\fesc(LyC) \\citep[e.g.][]{ver17}, JADES-GS-z7-LA may have \\fesc(LyC) $\\gtrsim 0.1$ \\citep[see also][]{dij16, ver17, mason20, maj22}. The small velocity offset of the peak of \\lya emission compared to the systemic velocity also suggests the presence of channels of ionized gas through which LyC photons could readily escape.\n",
      "Significant LyC escape may also be inferred from the high EW$_0$(\\oiii+\\hb) and O32 measured from the spectrum of JADES-GS-z7-LA \\citep[see][and references therein]{sax22a}, where the mild correlation observed between \\fesc(LyC) and the strength of \\oiii+\\hb emission would suggest \\fesc(LyC) $>0.2$. However, the relationship between these two quantities has considerable scatter, and studies have shown that high \\oiii+\\hb line strengths may also be achieved without significant LyC leakage \\citep[e.g.][]{paa18}.\n",
      "\\citet{zac13} also showed that the escape of LyC photons either from ionization-bounded \\hii regions with holes blown across them by star-formation and/or supernovae, or a density-bounded \\hii region photo-ionized by sources of hard radiation fields (e.g. low metallicity young stars) can be probed by using a combination of the UV slope and strength of the \\hb line. \\citet{zac13} showed that the strength of the \\hb EW actually decreases with increasing \\fesc(LyC). The \\hb EW can be used in combination with the steepness of the UV slope to infer \\fesc(LyC), where UV slopes of $\\beta < -2.4$ required for most assumed star-formation histories.\n",
      "JADES-GS-z7-LA shows a strong \\hb emission (EW$_0 \\approx 144$ Å), but does not show a particularly steep UV slope ($\\beta \\approx -2.1$). Using the parameter space probed by the models of \\citet{zac13}, no significant \\fesc(LyC) can be inferred from a galaxy with $\\beta = -2.1$ and EW$_0$(\\hb) $\\approx150$ \\citep[see also][]{chi22}. \\citet{top22} recently showed that even the inclusion of dust requires the observed UV slopes to be steeper than $-2.4$ to be able to infer LyC leakage from a system. A redder UV slope likely traces the presence of nebular continuum emission, meaning that a large fraction of LyC photons are being reprocessed within the galaxy to produce nebular continuum and line emission. The presence of dust can also redden the UV slope, which is also detrimental to LyC leakage. Although, the detection of strong \\lya emission can help rule out the presence of dust (at least along the line of sight), the presence of strong nebular emission lines points towards nebular contribution being the likely reason for a relatively shallow UV slope that is observed.\n",
      "By exploring multiple indicators of LyC leakage, we conclude that although certain spectroscopic indicators, most importantly the \\lya escape fraction, strength and line profile, are consistent with expectations for LyC leakage from JADES-GS-z7-LA, its measured UV slope is not indicative of LyC leakage. Since the rest-frame UV continuum is not well detected in the spectrum, most of the inference for the UV slope comes from the photometry, which we note may be prone to additional uncertainties.\n",
      "In light of these findings, we conclude that the current LyC \\fesc from JADES-GS-z7-LA is not necessarily substantially high. JADES-GS-z7-LA could have had significant LyC leakage in its past \\citep[e.g. a `remnant' leaker from][]{kat23a}, but based on currently available data there is no reliable way to infer this. The current or past LyC leakage from JADES-GS-z7-LA has bearing on its ability to inflate an ionized bubble large enough to explain the observed \\lya emission, and in the next section we investigate this in more detail.\n",
      "\\subsection{The nature of the ionized bubble surrounding JADES-GS-z7-LA}\n",
      "To be able to observe bright \\lya line emission (with high \\fesc(\\lya)) from a galaxy situated deep within the epoch of reionization, very close to the systemic redshift ($\\Delta v < 300$\\kms), the presence of a large ionized bubble surrounding the line-emitting source is required \\citep[e.g.][]{mir98}. The size of the ionized bubble that a high-redshift galaxy is capable of ionizing depends on both the galaxy properties as well as the global state of the IGM at that epoch \\citep{hai97, fur06}. The main parameters responsible for controlling the size of this bubble are a galaxy's UV luminosity, its average ionizing photon production efficiency, \\xiion, and the average fraction of LyC photons that manage to escape out of the galaxy, \\fesc \\citep[see][for recent examples]{end22a, cas22, tan23}. External factors that impact the size of the bubble are the average neutral hydrogen (H\\textsc{i}) density and the Hubble parameter at the redshift in question, the H\\textsc{i} clumping factor and the recombination coefficient.\n",
      "The presence of a close companion source next to JADES-GS-z7-LA, which seemingly lies at the same redshift, may further help with the ionizing photon budget required to inflate a bubble of ionized gas large enough to let \\lya emission through. Therefore, in this section we use simplified assumptions on the ionizing photon production histories of both JADES-GS-z7-LA and the companion to estimate whether one or both of these sources is/are capable of creating an ionized bubble large enough to explain the transmission of \\lya emission.\n",
      "To calculate the size of an ionized bubble that JADES-GS-z7-LA and/or its companion source could be capable of inflating, we mainly use the prescriptions laid out by \\citet{mason20}, which are mainly geared towards the earlier, pre-overlap phase of reionization when ionized bubbles grew around individual sources. \\citet{mason20} note that their calculations will effectively help establish lower limits on the size of the ionized bubbles around sources.\n",
      "Figure 1 of \\citet{mason20} suggests that to have a high degree of \\lya transmission (as seen in JADES-GS-z7-LA), with the peak of the line offset by $\\sim120$ \\kms from the systemic redshift at $z\\sim7$, a minimum ionized bubble size of $\\approx3$ pMpc is required. With this in mind, we now perform our calculations at a fixed source redshift of $z_s = 7.278$. We assume the IGM outside the bubble to be neutral with a density equal to the expected density of neutral gas at $z_s = 7.278$ from the calculations of \\citet{mad99}. In the simplest case, assuming a constant ionizing photon output from the sources, the size of the ionized bubble can be estimated using Equation (6) from \\citet{mason20}. Other variables involved in this calculation are the escape fraction of ionizing photons and the time since the ionizing source has been switched on.\n",
      "To estimate the ionizing photon output, we use Equation (9) from \\citet{mason20}, which uses the absolute UV magnitude measured at $1500$ Å and the UV slope of the spectral energy distribution of the ionizing sources. Here we use the measured UV slope ($\\beta$) for the value redwards of the Lyman limit, and use a fiducial value of $\\alpha = -2$ for the slope bluewards of the Lyman limit.\n",
      "In Figure \\ref{fig:bubble} we show the expected size of the bubble that JADES-GS-z7-LA (solid lines) and its companion (dashed lines) would be capable of inflating for a range of LyC escape fractions over a total switched on time of 30 Myr, which is close to the maximum age of star-formation activity that occurred in both galaxies based on best-fitting SEDs.\n",

      "    \\caption{Predicted sized of an ionized bubble that JADES-GS-z7-LA (solid lines) and its companion source (dashed lines) as a function of time since star-formation began for different LyC \\fesc. We use very simplistic assumptions here, where the ionizing photon production rates are considered to be constant over the entire lifetime of the sources, set to the currently inferred value from the UV magnitude. We find that neither JADES-GS-z7-LA nor the companion are capable of inflating an ionized bubble of size $\\approx3$ pMpc (shaded region), even if they had \\fesc(LyC) $=1.0$ over the past 100 Myr of their lifetime. The visibility of \\lya from JADES-GS-z7-LA, therefore, suggests that these galaxies may be part of an ionized bubble inflated by other galaxies in the field.}\n",
      "    \\label{fig:bubble}\n",
      "\\end{figure}\n",
      "We find that neither JADES-GS-z7-LA nor its companion source seem to be able to inflate a bubble of radius $\\gtrsim3$ pMpc on their own, required for \\lya emission to redshift out of resonance within $\\sim110$ km/s of the systemic redshift at $z\\sim7$, fully accounting for the observed \\lya emission seen from JADES-GS-z7-LA. Even with a constant \\fesc $=1.0$ over $\\sim100$ Myr, the estimated bubble size would fall substantially short of the 3 Mpc requirement. This is perhaps not surprising, as the sources reported in this study are several orders of magnitude fainter than those reported by \\citet{end22a} and \\citet{cas22} for example, that are capable of ionizing larger bubbles themselves.\n",
      "Qualitatively speaking, given the relative faintness of both sources, both of them working in combination to ionize their immediate surroundings would also not be enough to inflate a bubble of radius $\\approx3$ Mpc. Such a calculation would require careful radiative transfer modelling of the impact of ionizing photons produced by two nearby sources in a neutral medium, which is beyond the scope of this work.\n",
      "Therefore, given the extreme faintness and the high EW of \\lya emission from JADES-GS-z7-LA, it is unlikely that either it or the companion source would be able to produce an ionized bubble that is large enough to explain the observed \\lya emission. An alternative explanation is that JADES-GS-z7-LA and its companion source may be part of a larger overdensity of galaxies at $z\\approx7.3$ in the GOODS-S field, as a result of which the IGM neutral fraction may be lower than average \\citep[e.g.][]{tra22}. This would indicate that the ionized bubbles from sources in the field at $z\\approx7.3$ have already begun to overlap. In a forthcoming paper (Endsley et al. in prep) we will explore this possibility in greater detail.\n",
      "\\section{Conclusions}\n",
      "\\label{sec:conclusions}\n",
      "In this paper, we have presented the discovery of extremely high equivalent width \\lya emission (\\lya EW $=400$ Å) from a continuum-faint galaxy ($M_{\\rm{UV}} = -16.7)$ at $z=7.278$, called JADES-GS-z7-LA, using \\emph{JWST}/NIRSpec. The \\lya emission is clearly detected both in low resolution ($R\\sim100$) PRISM as well as medium resolution ($R\\sim1000$) G140M grating spectra. Rest-frame optical emission lines such as \\oii, \\hb and \\oiii are also well-detected in the PRISM spectrum, leading to an accurate spectroscopic redshift.\n",
      "The \\lya emission is remarkably bright and narrow (FWHM $= 358$ \\kms). The velocity offset of the peak of the \\lya line compared to the systemic velocity is only $\\approx120$ \\kms, suggesting the existence of low column density channels in the neutral gas as well as an ionized bubble around the galaxy. The high EW \\lya emission suggests a fairly dust-free environment along the line of sight, which is consistent with the limits on the Balmer decrements placed using \\hb and the non-detection of \\hg.\n",
      "Deep NIRCam imaging has additionally revealed the presence of a nearby ($\\sim0.23\"$ away) companion source, which was not covered in the MSA shutter placement that led to the spectrum of JADES-GS-z7-LA. The photometric properties of the companion source, however, are consistent with that of JADES-GS-z7-LA, with a strong excess seen in the F410M NIRCam medium band tracing \\oiii+\\hb at $z\\approx7.3$. This excess is understandably also seen in JADES-GS-z7-LA. There is also an excess in the F115W broad band from the companion source, consistent with \\lya emission at the same redshift.\n",
      "Considering the evidence that the companion also lies at $z\\approx7.3$, we find that the best-fitting SED is able to reproduce the photometry of the companion reasonably well when the redshift is fixed to that of JADES-GS-z7-LA. The best-fitting SED parameters indicate that JADES-GS-z7-LA has had a `bursty' star-formation history, with $\\approx49\\%$ of its stellar mass formed in a recent burst $\\approx2.2$ Myr long. The companion source on the other hand has only assembled $\\approx12\\%$ of its stellar mass over a recent burst lasting $\\approx3$ Myr, with the bulk of its stellar mass formed over a longer period.\n",
      "We report that under assumptions of no dust and Case B recombination, the inferred escape fraction of \\lya photons from JADES-GS-z7-LA is $\\approx96\\%$. This suggests that in addition to a lack of substantial neutral gas and dust within JADES-GS-z7-LA, it must also exist in a fairly ionized bubble in an otherwise neutral intergalactic medium. We investigate signs of significant Lyman continuum (LyC) photon escape from JADES-GS-z7-LA based on its spectroscopic and photometric properties and find that although certain spectroscopic indicators are consistent with known LyC leakers at lower redshifts, its relatively shallow UV slope ($\\beta \\approx-2.1$) is incompatible with models suggestive of significant LyC leakage. A shallow UV slope may trace significant nebular continuum emission, resulting in a significant fraction of LyC photons being absorbed by the gas instead of escaping out of the galaxy.\n",
      "Using simple assumptions on the ionizing photon production and escape history, we find that JADES-GS-z7-LA and its companion source would not be able to individually inflate an ionized bubble large enough ($\\gtrsim3$ pMpc) to explain the observed \\lya emission strength and velocity offset, even if they have had a ionizing photon escape fraction, \\fesc $=1.0$ continuously over a period of $100$ Myr. Based on this we argue that both JADES-GS-z7-LA and its companion, if confirmed to lie at the same redshift, may be part of a larger overdensity in the field at $z\\approx7.3$, tracing an epoch when the ionized bubbles have already begun to overlap in the field.\n",
      "These observations demonstrate the incredibly transformative power of \\emph{JWST} NIRSpec and NIRCam observations in discovering strong emission lines from distant galaxies, leading to an increased understanding of the relatively poorly understood contribution of fainter star-forming galaxies towards cosmic reionization.\n",

       "**Abstract:** We report the discovery of a remarkable Ly $\\alpha$ emitting galaxy at $z=7.278$ , JADES-GS+53.16746-27.7720 (shortened to JADES-GS-z7-LA), with EW $_0$ (Ly $\\alpha$ ) $\\approx400 \\pm 90$ Å and UV magnitude $-16.7$ . The spectroscopic redshift is confirmed via rest-frame optical lines [ O ii ] , H $\\beta$ and [ O iii ] in its JWST/NIRSpec Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) spectrum. The Ly $\\alpha$ line is detected in both lower resolution ( $R\\sim100$ ) PRISM as well as medium resolution ( $R\\sim1000$ ) G140M grating spectra. The Ly $\\alpha$ FWHM in the grating is $\\approx360$ km s $^{-1}$ and the line peaks with [ O ii ] in $120$ km s $^{-1}$ of the systemic redshift, indicative of very little neutral gas or dust within the galaxy. We estimate the Ly $\\alpha$ escape fraction to be $\\sim100\\%$ . JADES-GS-z7-LA has a [ O iii ] / [ O ii ] ratio (O32) of $8.8 \\pm 1.1$ and ( [ O iii ] + [ O ii ] )/H $\\beta$ ratio (R23) of $9.6\\pm2.2$ , consistent with low metallicity and high ionization parameters. Deep NIRCam imaging also revealed a close companion source (separated by $0.23\"$ ), which exhibits similar photometry to that of JADES-GS-z7-LA, with a photometric excess in the F410M NIRCam image consistent with [ O iii ] +H $\\beta$ emission at the same redshift. The spectral energy distribution of JADES-GS-z7-LA indicates a `bursty' star-formation history, with a low stellar mass of $10^{7.15}$ M $_\\odot$ . The only explanation of the high EW Ly $\\alpha$ emission seen in JADES-GS-z7-LA is if it resides in an ionized bubble with radius $\\gtrsim 3$ pMpc. Owing to the faint nature of JADES-GS-z7-LA, we show that it is incapable of single-handedly ionizing a bubble large enough. Therefore, we suggest that JADES-GS-z7-LA (and possibly the companion source) may be a part of a larger overdensity, presenting direct evidence of overlapping ionized bubbles at $z>7$ , allowing us to study the process of reionization across both small and large scales.\n",
