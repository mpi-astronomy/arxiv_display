       "|**Abstract**|            Relativistic jets are thought to play a crucial role in the formation of massive galaxies and supermassive black holes. Here we report multi-wavelength and multi-epoch observations of the quasar VLASSJ0410-0139 at redshift z=7, powered by a 7e8 solar-mass black hole. Its radio variability, X-ray properties, and compact radio emission on parsec scales reveal that J0410-0139 is a blazar with a relativistic jet aligned with our line of sight. This blazar's existence implies that many more similar (unaligned) jetted sources must exist at z=7. One scenario is that we observe an intrinsically low-power radio jet, but we see it at high luminosity due to relativistic beaming effects. In this case, a large fraction (>80%) of the UV bright quasars must have a similar jet to match the number density expected from the UV quasar luminosity function. These jets can enhance the growth of supermassive black holes and substantially affect their host galaxies. However, the implications would be even more severe if the quasar belongs to the top 10% radio luminous quasars, as measured if the beaming enhancement is less than a factor of 10-15. In this scenario, there should be hundreds to thousands of radio-quiet quasars at z=7 with intrinsic properties similar to J0410-0139 -- in strong tension with the number density of bright quasars derived from their UV luminosity function. To reconcile these results, most black hole growth at z=7 must happen in an obscured phase, as some models predict. The existence of supermassive black holes in the epoch of reionization is facilitated by significant jet-enhanced or obscured super-Eddington accretion.         |"

       "|**Abstract**|            Resolved molecular line observations are essential for gaining insight into the physical and chemical structure of protoplanetary disks, particularly in cold, dense regions where planets form and acquire compositions. However, tracing these regions is challenging because most molecules freeze onto grain surfaces and are not observable in the gas phase. We investigated cold molecular chemistry in the triple stellar T Tauri disk GG Tau A, which harbours a massive gas and dust ring and an outer disk, using ALMA Band 7 observations. We present high angular resolution maps of N2H+ and DCO+ emission, with upper limits reported for H2D+, 13CS, and SO2. The radial intensity profile of N2H+ shows most emission near the ring outer edge, while DCO+ exhibits double peaks, one near the ring inner edge and the other in the outer disk. With complementary observations of lower-lying transitions, we constrained the molecular surface densities and rotation temperatures. We compared the derived quantities with model predictions across different cosmic ray ionization (CRI) rates, carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios, and stellar UV fluxes. Cold molecular chemistry, affecting N2H+, DCO+, and H2D+ abundances, is most sensitive to CRI rates, while stellar UV flux and C/O ratios have minimal impact on these three ions. Our best model requires a low cosmic ray ionization rate of 1e-18 s-1. However, it fails to match the low temperatures derived from N2H+ and DCO+, 12 to 16 K, which are much lower than the CO freezing temperature.         |"

       "|**Abstract**|            Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are a new observational class of phenomena with no clear physical origin. This is at least partially a consequence of limited multi-wavelength follow up of this class of transients in real time. Here we present deep optical ($g-$ and $i-$ band) photometry with Keck, and prompt radio observations with the VLA of FXT 210423 obtained at ${\\delta t \\approx 14-36}$ days since the X-ray trigger. We use these multi-band observations, combined with publicly available data sets, to constrain the presence and physical properties of on-axis and off-axis relativistic jets such as those that can be launched by neutron-star mergers and tidal disruption events, which are among the proposed theoretical scenarios of FXTs. Considering a wide range of possible redshifts $z\\le3.5$, circumstellar medium (CSM) density $n={10^{-6}-10^{-1}\\,\\rm{cm^{-3}}}$, isotropic-equivalent jet kinetic energy $E_{k,iso}={10^{48}-10^{55}\\,\\rm{erg}}$, we find that we can rule out wide jets with opening angle ${\\theta_{j}=15^{\\circ}}$ viewed within ${10^{\\circ}}$ off-axis. For more collimated jets (${\\theta_{j}=3^{\\circ}}$) we can only rule out on-axis (${\\theta_{j}=0^{\\circ}}$) orientations. This study highlights the constraining power of prompt multi-wavelength observations of FXTs discovered in real time by current (e.g., Einstein Probe) and future facilities.         |"

       "|**Abstract**|            Photometric redshifts are widely used in studies of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs), but catastrophic photo-$z$ failure can undermine all redshift-dependent results. Here we report the spectroscopic redshift confirmation of COSBO-7, a strongly lensed DSFG in the COSMOS-PRIMER field. Recently, using 10 bands of JWST NIRCam and MIRI imaging data on COSBO-7, Ling et al. (2024) reported a photometric redshift solution of $z\\gtrsim7.0$, favored by four independent spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes, and therefore providing an appealing candidate of the most distant massive DSFG. This photo-$z$ solution was also supported by a single line detection in ALMA Band 3 consistent with CO(7-6) at $z=7.46$. However, our new ALMA observations robustly detect two lines in Band 6 identified as CO(7-6) and [CI](2-1) at $z_{\\rm spec}=2.625$, and thus the Band 3 line as CO(3-2). The three robust line detections decidedly place COSBO-7 at $z=2.625$, refuting the photo-$z$ solution. We derive physical parameters by fitting NIR-to-mm photometry and lens modeling, revealing that COSBO-7 is a main-sequence galaxy. We examine possible reasons for this photo-$z$ failure and attribute it to (1) the likely underestimation of photometric uncertainty at 0.9$\\mu$m, and (2) the lack of photometry at wavelengths beyond 20$\\mu$m. Notably, we recover a bona-fide $z_{\\rm phot}\\sim 2.3$ by including the existing MIPS $24\\mu$m photometry, demonstrating the critical importance of mid-infrared data for photo-$z$ robustness. This work highlights a common challenge in modeling SEDs of DSFGs, cautioning against the reliability of photometric redshifts, as well as pseudo-spectroscopic redshifts based on single line detection.         |"

We constrain the outer disk emission with both image-plane retrieval, and visibility-plane modeling with non-parametric and parametric fitting tools. Our results confirm emission in the outer disk regions of TW Hya (60 au < R < 110 au) at 0.65 mm, 0.87 mm and 1.3 mm. With image-plane retrieval, we resolve the new continuum gap and ring, namely D79 and B86, at 0.87 mm and 1.3 mm. With visibility-plane modeling, we also detect this substructure at 0.65 mm, and it is consistent in location with the outer ring proposed by Ilee et al. 2022 at the 1-sigma level. Furthermore, it has a high spectral index of 3.7, which may indicate dust grain sizes << 1 mm. It may be a dust trap or a traffic jam, that has a flux density of 60 mJy and a mass (1.59 earth masses) that accounts for up to 2% of the dust disk at 0.65 mm. In conclusion, we confirm the existence of a faint ring in the outer regions of TW Hya at multiple millimeter wavelengths. With visibility-plane modeling, we are able to set constrains that are 3 times better than the resolution of our Band 8 observations.         |"

       "|**Abstract**|            Young brown dwarfs exhibit atmospheric characteristics similar to those of super-Jupiters, providing a unique opportunity to study planetary atmospheres. The ESO SupJup Survey, utilizing CRIRES$^+$ on the Very Large Telescope, aims to assess the role of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C as a formation tracer. We present observations of three young brown dwarfs: 2MASS J12003792-7845082, TWA 28, and 2MASS J08561384-1342242, with the goal of constraining their chemical compositions, thermal profiles, surface gravities, spin rotations, and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C. Atmospheric retrievals of CRIRES$^+$ K-band spectra were conducted using the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS coupled with the Bayesian inference algorithm MultiNest, resulting in a detailed characterization of the atmospheres of these objects. We report the volume mixing ratios of main molecular and atomic species, including the novel detection of hydrogen fluoride (HF) in a brown dwarf's atmosphere, and determine $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C values of $81^{+28}_{-19}$ and $79^{+20}_{-14}$ in the atmospheres of TWA 28 and J0856, respectively, with strong significance ($>3\\sigma$). Tentative evidence ($\\sim 2\\sigma$) of $^{13}$C in J1200 was found, with $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = $114^{+69}_{-33}$, along with $^{18}$O detected at moderate significance in J0856 (3.3$\\sigma$) and TWA 28 (2.1$\\sigma$). The retrieved thermal profiles indicate hot atmospheres (2300-2600 K) with low surface gravities and slow spins, consistent with young objects. The consistent carbon isotope ratios among the three objects, showing no significant deviation from the local ISM, suggest a fragmentation-based formation mechanism similar to star formation. The tentative detection of $^{18}$O in two objects highlights the potential of high-resolution spectroscopy to probe additional isotope ratios, such as $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O, in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and super-Jupiters.         |"

We investigate three different parameterizations of potential DDR violations. To bridge the gap between SGL and SNe Ia datasets, we implement an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to reconstruct the distance modulus of SNe Ia. Our analysis uniquely considers both scenarios where the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia ($M_B$) is treated as a free parameter and where it is fixed to a Cepheid-calibrated value. Using a sample of six SGL systems and the Pantheon+ SNe Ia dataset, we find no statistically significant evidence for DDR violations across all parameterizations. The consistency of our findings across different parameterizations not only reinforces confidence in the standard DDR but also demonstrates the robustness of our analytical approach.         |\n",

       "|**Abstract**|            Stars in the Galactic disk are born on cold, nearly circular orbits with small vertical excursions. After their birth, their orbits evolve, driven by small- or large-scale perturbations in the Galactic disk's gravitational potential. Here, we study the vertical motions of young stars over their first few orbital periods, using a sample of OBA stars from \\textit{Gaia} E/DR3, which includes radial velocities and ages $\\tau$ from LAMOST. We constructed a parametric model for the time evolution of the stellar orbits' mean vertical actions $J_z$ as a function of Galactocentric radius, $R_{\\mathrm{GC}}$. Accounting for data uncertainties, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis in annuli of Galactocentric radius to constrain the model parameters. Our best-fit model shows a remarkably linear increase of vertical actions with age across all Galactocentric radii examined. Orbital \\textit{heating} by random scattering could offer a straightforward interpretation for this trend. However, various other dynamical aspects of the Galactic disk, such as stars being born in a warped disk, might offer alternative explanations that could be tested in the future.         |\n",

       "**Abstract:** **Relativistic jets are thought to play a crucial role in the formation of massive galaxies and supermassive black holesblandford2019**.Here we report multi-wavelength and multi-epoch observations of the quasar VLASS J041009.05$-$013919.88 (hereafter J0410--0139) at redshift $z=7.0$,  powered by a $7\\times10^8 M_\\odot$ black hole.Its radio variability,  X-ray properties,  and compact radio emission on parsec scales reveal that J0410--0139 is a blazar with a relativistic jet aligned with our line of sight.  This blazar's existence implies that many more similar (unaligned) jetted sources must exist at $z \\sim 7$.One scenario is that we observe an intrinsically low-power radio jet,  but we see it at high luminosity due to relativistic beaming effects.  In this case,  a large fraction ($>80\\%$) of the UV bright quasars must have a similar jet to match the number density expected from the UV quasar luminosity function\\cite{matsuoka2023.  These jets can enhance the growth of supermassive black holesjolley2008 and substantially affect their host galaxiesventuri2021.However, the implications would be even more severe if the quasar belongs to the top 10\\% radio luminous quasarsbanados2015a, liu2021, as measured if the beaming enhancement is less than a factor of $10-15$.In this scenario, there should be hundreds to thousands of radio-quiet quasars at $z \\sim 7$ with intrinsic properties similar to \\blazarvolonteri2011, ghisellini2013---in strong tension with the number density of bright quasars derived from their UV luminosity function. To reconcile these results, most black hole growth at $z \\sim 7$ must happen in an obscured phase, as some models predictjohnson2022, satyavolu2023.The existence of supermassive black holes in the epoch of reionization is facilitated by significant jet-enhanced or obscured super-Eddington accretion.}\n",

       "$    Resolved molecular line observations are essential for gaining insight into the physical and chemical structure of protoplanetary disks, particularly in cold, dense regions where planets form and acquire compositions. However, tracing these regions is challenging because most molecules freeze onto grain surfaces and are not observable in the gas phase. We investigated cold molecular chemistry in the triple stellar T Tauri disk GG Tau A, which harbours a massive gas and dust ring and an outer disk, using ALMA Band 7 observations. We present high angular resolution maps of \\ce{N2H+} and \\ce{DCO+} emission, with upper limits reported for \\ce{H2D+}, ^{13}CS, and \\ce{SO2}. The radial intensity profile of \\ce{N2H+} shows most emission near the ring outer edge, while \\ce{DCO+} exhibits double peaks, one near the ring inner edge and the other in the outer disk. With complementary observations of lower-lying transitions, we constrained the molecular surface densities and rotation temperatures. We compared the derived quantities with model predictions across different cosmic ray ionization (CRI) rates, carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios, and stellar UV fluxes. \\textbf{Cold molecular chemistry, affecting \\ce{N2H+}, \\ce{DCO+}, and \\ce{H2D+} abundances, is most sensitive to CRI rates, while stellar UV flux and C/O ratios have minimal impact on these three ions. Our best model requires a low cosmic ray ionization rate of 10^{-18} s^{-1}. However, it fails to match the low temperatures derived from \\ce{N2H+} and \\ce{DCO+}, 12 to 16 K, which are much lower than the CO freezing temperature.}$\n",

       "$A protoplanetary disk is a crucial stage in the evolution of cosmic matter, where the interplay of inherited material from a parent cloud and the in-situ physics and chemistry establishes the conditions for planet formation. Protoplanetary disks are characterized by complex chemical stratification owing to radial and vertical variations in density, temperature, ionization, and dissociative radiation  ([Aikawa and Herbst 2002]()) . The uppermost layers usually allow the formation of simple atoms, ions, and photo-stable radicals, while the intermediate warm molecular layer produces most of the gas phase molecules traced by the  Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. There is minimal penetration of stellar radiation in \\textbf{the vertically innermost regions near the midplane}, making them very cold and poorly ionized. In this dense region, most of the molecules freeze onto grain surfaces. Hence, midplane regions are very difficult to probe. N_2H^+, DCO^+, and H_2D^+ are among the very few molecules which remain in the gas phase in the midplane region  ([Ceccarelli, et. al 2004](), [Öberg, et. al 2011]()) .\\par$\n",
       "$N_2H^+ is expected to be abundant in regions where \\ce{CO} is depleted. This anti-correlation is observed in both dense cores \\citep[e.g.,][]{Caselli1999, Bergin2002} as well as in disks  ([Walsh, et. al 2012]()) . \\ce{N2H+} is produced through the protonation of \\ce{N2} and rapidly destroyed by CO in its presence to form \\ce{HCO+}.$\n",
       "$Hence, N_2H^+ can persist in the gas phase \\textbf{at temperatures a few Kelvin} below the CO snowline  ([Öberg and Fraser 2005]()) . N_2H^+ has been observed in multiple disks \\citep[e.g.,][]{Dutrey2007, Qi2013, Phuong2021, Anderson2022}, but is often characterized by comparatively weak emission.\\par$\n",
       "$An enhanced abundance of H_2D^+ is predicted by chemical models at low temperatures (T<20 K), with the major formation pathway being protonation of \\ce{HD}  ([Roberts and Millar 2000]()) . Hence, H_2D^+ can only be observed in \\textbf{high-density regions with low \\ce{CO} and \\ce{N2} content} where \\ce{H3+} has not already been destroyed. H_2D^+ has already been detected in prestellar cores \\citep[e.g.,][]{Caselli2008}, but there is no clear detection in any of the protoplanetary disks \\citep[e.g.,][]{Ceccarelli2004,Thi2004,Qi2008, Chapillon2011}. \\par$\n",
       "$DCO^+ serves as an effective indicator of low-temperature CO freezeout regions within the disk and is predominantly formed through the interaction of \\ce{CO} with H_2D^+  (Wootten1987) . \\textbf{On the one hand, the formation of one of the parent molecules, H_2D^+, mainly occurs through HD protonation and is hindered by \\ce{H3+} destruction in the presence of CO. On the other hand, the presence of CO is essential for DCO^+ formation.} Consequently, DCO^+ emission is expected to peak in a narrow region around the \\ce{CO} snowline where both the parent molecules are in the gas phase in small amounts  ([Aikawa and Herbst 2002](), [ and Willacy 2007](), [Mathews, Klaassen and Juhász 2013]()) .\\par$\n",
       "$In summary, N_2H^+, DCO^+, and H_2D^+ are excellent tracers of low-temperature, high-density regions of the disk, specifically the midplane region in outer disks. Simultaneous observations of these molecules allow us to locate the CO snowline. \\textbf{Snowlines are thought to play a significant role in planet formation since ice coating of grains enhances the solid mass, potentially promotes coagulation of grains to larger particles, and/or requires a higher collision velocity for destruction, effects which are particularly prominent just outside the snowline  ([Okuzumi, et. al 2012]()) .} Additionally, such observations new insights into ionization fractions within the relevant disk areas, offering constraints that can impact magneto-rotational instability. In instances of excessively low ionization fractions, \"dead zones\"  ([ and Gammie 1996]())  form, which are conducive to efficient grain growth and subsequent planet formation \\citep[e.g.,][]{Oberg2011}. \\par$\n",
       "$This work reports spatially resolved emission from \\nnhp and \\dcop and upper limits for \\hhdp, \\CS, and \\soo in the disk around a triple stellar T Tauri system, GG Tau A, utilizing the ALMA interferometer. \\textbf{This represents the most sensitive observation of these molecules in GG Tau A to date.} The system (age 1-5 Myr) is located at a distance of 150 pc \\citep[\\textbf{using the GAIA parallax measurements of the GG Tau Ba star of this hierarchical quintuple system, because those of GG Tau A are contaminated by its triple nature,}][]{Gaia2016,Gaia2018} from us in the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. \\textbf{This circumtertiary disk is characterized by a dense ring of gas and dust between 193 and 285 au (from here on, we simply use the term ring to denote this region) and an outer disk extended up to 800 au in ^{13}CO observations  ([Guilloteau, Dutrey and Simon 1999](), [Dutrey and Guilloteau 2014]()) . The majority of the total disk mass (0.15 M_{\\odot}) is concentrated in the ring region (0.13 M_{\\odot})  ([Guilloteau, Dutrey and Simon 1999](), [Andrews, Chandler and Isella 2014]()) }. [Dutrey and Guilloteau (2014)]() reported the presence of a hot spot located at the outer edge of the dense ring where a partial CO gap is observed  ([Tang, Dutrey and Guilloteau 2016]()) , suggesting the presence of an embedded planet. This hypothesis is reinforced by the detection of a CO spiral emanating from the hot spot  ([Phuong and Dutrey 2020]()) .$\n",
       "$This disk is very cold, with a midplane temperature of \\sim 14 K  ([Dutrey and Guilloteau 2014]())  and an atmospheric temperature of \\sim 30 K  ([Guilloteau, Dutrey and Simon 1999](), [Phuong, Dutrey and Diep 2020]()) , at a radial distance of 214 au from the center. The first-ever detection of \\ce{H2S} in the outer disk of GG Tau A by [Phuong, Chapillon and Majumdar (2018)]() further confirms how dense and massive this system is. Given its substantial mass, high density (which should ease the detection of weak molecular lines), and low temperature, GG Tau A emerges as an ideal candidate for unravelling the intricacies of cold molecular chemistry within a protoplanetary disk. \\par$\n",

Phase calibration was conducted using the sources J0510+1800 and J0440+1437. The observed data were initially calibrated with CASA, the Common Astronomy Software Applications package (version 6.4.1.12) pipeline. Subsequently, five rounds of continuum self-phase calibration were performed for each execution, selecting line-free channels carefully. The self-calibration solutions were then applied to the entire dataset. To determine the disk center, we fitted the continuum structure with an ellipse, \\textbf{and both executions were recentered to the disk center using the \\texttt{fixvis} task in CASA.} The data with the identical spectral setups from both executions were then combined using the \\texttt{concat} task in CASA. We \\textbf{performed continuum subtraction} on the self-calibrated recentered data by fitting a first-order polynomial to the continuum channels using \\texttt{uvcontsub} task in CASA. We constructed the images from our visibility dataset in  \\texttt{tclean} task in CASA using \\texttt{hogbom} deconvolving algorithm with \\texttt{briggs} weighting (robust=1.0).

Furthermore, when several transitions of the same molecules are available, it allows a quantitative estimate of the molecular surface densities and excitation temperatures. It also allows for consistent estimates of the errors on the disk parameters (within the framework of the adopted disk model). This can be done either from the covariance matrix (when parameter coupling is limited) or through a more elaborate$\n",
       "$Monte Carlo Markov Chain method.$\n",
       "$The disk model is similar to that used in [Phuong, Dutrey and Diep (2020)](). It uses a flared disk geometry with a Gaussian vertical profile and a radial power-law for the scale height. Molecules are assumed to follow the same vertical distribution for simplicity. The model assumes level populations are governed by a Boltzmann law, with the temperature being a power law of radius. For a simple comparison with the \\textbf{observed data}, we assume that the intrinsic line width remains constant with radius. \\textbf{In fact, fitting line width as a power law instead suggests a small but non-significant decrease with radius that does not affect the other disk parameters.} The emerging line intensity is derived using simple ray tracing, considering the geometry and dynamics  (position, orientation, inclination, velocity, and Keplerian rotation pattern) and level populations computed at every sampled point along the line of sight. The hyperfine structure of the observed lines is also considered at this stage. This approach implicitly accounts for line optical depth.$\n",
       "$Visibilities are then computed on the same (u,v) points as the data from the 3D data cube. A least square minimization is performed on the different visibilities using a modified Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. \\textbf{Guided by the radial distribution of velocity-integrated brightness (Figure \\ref{fig:radial_intensity}) and apparent brightness temperature (Figure \\ref{fig:kepler-n2h}), we represented the radial surface density profiles for each molecule by the sum of two Gaussians, truncated to inner and outer radii of 150 and 550 au, respectively. The rotation temperature is assumed to be a simple power law, newcommandined by its value at 250 au, T_{250} and exponent q.} The model thus has 15 possible parameters, 6 due to geometry and 9 to represent the molecular distribution and excitation conditions (see Tables \\ref{tab:geom}-\\ref{tab:diskfitabun} for their designation). Error bars were derived from the covariance matrix. The 6 geometric parameters, the line width \\delta V, and temperature parameters exhibit very little coupling among them and with the other ones.

Despite the diverse continuum structures of the disks with multiple rings and gaps, \\ce{N2H+} emission showcases a ring morphology (Figure 4 in [Cataldi, Yamato and Aikawa (2021)]()). Our \\ce{N2H+} emission is also characterized by a single-ring structure (Figure \\ref{fig:radial_intensity}). [Qi, Öberg and Wilner (2013)]() has previously reported \\ce{N2H+} detection towards TW Hya, and the single-ring emission structure is also evident there. The \\ce{N2H+} ring morphology across different disks can be attributed to radial and vertical temperature variations  ([Qi, Öberg and Wilner 2013]()) . In the MAPS survey by [Cataldi, Yamato and Aikawa (2021)](), two different \\ce{N2H+} surface density values are derived by fixing the excitation temperature, T_{\\text{ex}}, to a) the observationally constrained CO freeze-out temperature \\sim 20 K and b) the midplane temperatures, T_{\\text{mid}}, of the respective disks. For the T Tauri disks (IM Lup, GM Aur, and AS 209), the \\ce{N2H+} surface density peaks around 10^{13} cm^{-2}, while for the Herbig Ae disks (HD 163296 and MWC 480), it reaches up to 10^{12} cm^{-2}. The surface density in TW Hya reported by [Qi, Öberg and Wilner (2013)]() ranges from 4 \\times 10^{12} to 2 \\times 10^{15} cm^{-2} for different assumed physical structures.[Cataldi, Yamato and Aikawa (2021)]() indicates that temperatures as low as 12 K in the \\ce{N2H+} emitting region can also explain the observed flux of the 3-2 transition in the protoplanetary disks (e.g., GM Aur, HD 163296, MWC 480) under the LTE assumption. Previously, in [Phuong, Dutrey and Chapillon (2021)]()'s study, \\ce{N2H+} in GG Tau A was assumed to be arising from the same layer as CO, following a radial temperature variation, T(r) = 20 (r/250 \\text{ au})^{-1} K. Our direct measure of T(r) = 12 K for the \\ce{N2H+} emitting region (Table \\ref{tab:diskfitabun}), based on multi-line excitation analysis, suggests that we are tracing a region much closer to the midplane than initially assumed.}$\n",
       "$\\textbf{A ring-like radial distribution for \\ce{DCO+} has been commonly observed in multiple disks, including the TW Hya, DM Tau, AS 209, V4046 Sgr, MWC 480 and HD 163296  ([Qi, et. al 2008](), [Mathews, Klaassen and Juhász 2013](), [Teague, Semenov and Guilloteau 2015](), [Huang, Öberg and Qi 2017]())  and is facilitated by reaction between \\ce{H2D+} and \\ce{CO} (e.g. [ and Willacy (2007)]()). Contrary to the common scenario, we observe partially overlapping double-ring radial distribution of \\ce{DCO+} emission in GG Tau A (refer to Figure \\ref{fig:radial_intensity}), which can likely be attributed to different chemical effects in the ring and the outer disk regions owing to the difference in densities between the two regions. This is discussed in detail in Sections \\ref{subsec:chem_ring} and \\ref{subsec:chem_outerdisk}. Notably, [Öberg, Furuya and Loomis (2015)]() observes double \\ce{DCO+} rings in the disk IM Lup. They found that \\ce{DCO+} abundance first decreases radially due to CO depletion, then another ring forms due to non-thermal desorption of CO in low surface density outer regions as a result of higher UV penetration. [Phuong, Chapillon and Majumdar (2018)](), [Phuong, Dutrey and Chapillon (2021)]() have previously assumed that \\ce{DCO+} emission originates from the same region as \\ce{N2H+} and \\ce{CO} characterized by radial temperature, T(r) = 20 (r/ 250 \\text{ au} )^{-1} K in GG Tau A. In this work, we found that \\ce{DCO+} emission region is best represented by T(r) = 16 (r/250 \\text{ au})^{-0.39} K (Table \\ref{tab:diskfitabun}). Hence, we expect that \\ce{DCO+} emission region lies vertically between \\ce{CO} emitting region and \\ce{N2H+} emitting region and closer to the midplane than previously thought.}$\n",

       "$\\paragraph{\\textbf{Cosmic Ray Ionization}}$\n",
       "$\\textbf{Figure \\ref{fig:comp_cr} shows the variation of modelled abundances with CRI rates while keeping the rest of the parameters fixed to standard values. \\ce{N2H+}, \\ce{DCO+}, and \\ce{H2D+} abundances are quite sensitive to CRI rates, while UV flux values have no impact whatsoever. This is expected because these molecules probe a high-density, low-temperature, CO-depleted region near the mid-plane where UV penetration is minimal. Hence, cosmic rays are the primary ionization source for this cold molecular chemistry. However, the CRI rate has barely any impact on S-bearing species. It is worth noting that the standard interstellar CRI rate of 10^{-17} s^{-1} predicts the \\ce{H2D+} surface density above the upper limit and a sub-interstellar CRI rate of 10^{-18} s^{-1} explains the observationally constrained surface densities the best. This low CRI rate can be explained by a rise in the number of collisions experienced by CR particles due to the greater effective surface density as they gyrate towards the disk midplane  ([Padovani, Hennebelle and Galli 2013]()) . The attenuation is especially prominent in our case, as our chemistry focuses on high-density near midplane regions. [Cleeves, et. al (2015)]() have previously inferred a very low CRI  (10^{-19} s^{-1}) in the protoplanetary disk TW Hya, which they suggest is due to an exclusion by a young stellar wind. Our current astrochemical model only includes a constant CR ionization rate across the disk. The inclusion of short-lived radionuclides  ([Cleeves, Adams and Bergin 2013]())  and vertical distribution of CRI rates  ([Padovani, et. al 2018]())  may new a better picture.}$\n",

Changing the C/O ratios from 0.5 to 1.2 has decreased the \\ce{N2H+} surface density by a factor of approximately 2.5, while the \\ce{DCO+} surface density increases by at most a factor of 1-2, and the \\ce{H2D+} surface density remains unaffected. Overall, the C/O ratio has an insignificant impact on these three molecules. However, the chemistry of \\ce{^{13}CS} and \\ce{SO2}, for which we obtained the upper limit from our observations, is quite sensitive to changes in the C/O ratio. The general trend is that O-poor chemistry favours the formation of the C-S bond, and for \\ce{SO2}, it is the other way around$\n",

       "$Our observations are best represented by a CRI rate of 10^{-18} s^{-1} and an elemental C/O ratio of 1.0. At the commencement of the evolution of a molecular cloud, a significant amount of important elements, including carbon (C) and oxygen (O), exist in a refractory state, which is expected to shape the chemical budget of the protoplanetary disk formed from that cloud. Based on [Boogert, Gerakines and Whittet (2015)]()'s observation on ice abundances, [Öberg and Bergin (2021)]() reports that about 40\\% O chemical budget was unaccounted for at the onset of star and planet formation, leading to a poor constraint on initial C and O gas phase abundances. Our elemental C/O ratio of 1.0 suggests an oxygen-depleted environment in the dense ring.$\n",

We see a \\ce{DCO+} distribution in those regions where CO is available in the gas phase in small amounts. Observationally, \\ce{DCO+} follows a ring-like emission distribution in the ring region (refer to Figures \\ref{fig:radial_intensity} and \\ref{fig:kepler-n2h}). In our modelled abundances, \\ce{DCO+} is primarily peaking up in temperature regions representative of the warm molecular layer (2.5- 3.5H_r), somewhat showcasing the ring-like distribution. One of the dominant ions in the warm molecular layer is \\ce{HCO+}. It essentially forms through the protonation of \\ce{CO} and, in turn, produces DCO^+ through isotope exchange. The major reaction for DCO^+ production contributing to our observation above 2.5H_r is \\ce{HCO+ + D -> DCO+ + H}. We also see some \\ce{DCO+} arising below the warm molecular layer (\\sim 0.5 - 2.5 H_r) produced through a different channel, \\ce{CO + N2D+ -> N2 + DCO+}. Our \\textsc{DiskFit} analysis locates the peak of the \\ce{DCO+} ring at radial distance 210 \\pm 50 au (R_1 in Table \\ref{tab:diskfitabun}), and this can be attributed to the fact that both the \\ce{DCO+} formation channels are contributing to \\ce{DCO+} abundances in this radial range. Near the disk midplane, \\ce{DCO+} starts depleting because its parent molecule, \\ce{CO}, efficiently freezes onto the grain surfaces owing to high density and low temperature.}$\n",
       "$\\textbf{\\ce{N2H+} modelled distribution lies just below the \\ce{DCO+} layer, with its number density peaking up in the regions where \\ce{DCO+} starts depleting. Our observationally constrained representative temperatures of 16 K and 12 K for \\ce{DCO+} and \\ce{N2H+} emitting regions, respectively (Table \\ref{tab:diskfitabun}), suggest the same. N_2H^+ is abundant in the midplane at the inner edge of the ring as well as in the warm molecular layer (up to 3.0H_r) at the outer edge of the ring. All throughout the ring region, the major formation pathway of N_2H^+ is the protonation of \\ce{N2}, i.e., \\ce{N2 + H3+ -> H2 + N2H+}. \\ce{H3+} is the most abundant ion in the near-midplane region. So, the chemistry is mainly controlled by gas phase abundances of \\ce{CO}, \\ce{N2} and \\ce{HD}. \\ce{CO} is the most efficient in capturing \\ce{H3+}, followed by \\ce{N2} and \\ce{HD}. As long as \\ce{CO} remains in the gas phase, it destroys \\ce{N2H+} to form \\ce{HCO+}. When CO starts depleting, \\ce{N2H+} start increasing, as \\ce{N2} is still in the gas phase owing to its lower binding energy with respect to CO, forming \\ce{N2H+} and there is less destruction of \\ce{N2H+} because of the reduced CO presence.}$\n",
       "$\\textbf{Our astrochemical model suggests that \\ce{H2D+} is abundant in the midplane region, situated just below the \\ce{N2H+} layer. The major formation pathway predicted by our model is \\ce{H3+ + HD -> H2D+ + H2}. As \\ce{N2} begins to freeze onto grain surfaces, more \\ce{H3+} become available for \\ce{HD} to capture, and we see a rise in \\ce{H2D+} abundances and a fall in \\ce{N2H+} abundances.}$\n",
       "$We did not detect \\ce{H2D+}. In our effort to replicate the observed surface density for the detected molecules, we realized that a lower cosmic ray ionization rate may new the best explanation for our observations. \\ce{H2D+} in the cold midplane region is primarily formed by protonation of \\ce{HD}. Therefore, \\ce{H2D+} abundances are regulated by the availability of \\ce{H3+}, which in turn is dependent on the rate of ionization of \\ce{H2}. A lower CRI rate results in reduced \\ce{H2+} production (\\ce{H2 + CR -> H2+ + e-}), leading to a lower abundance of \\ce{H3+} (\\ce{H2 + H2+ -> H3+ + H }). Hence, a lower ionization rate at the midplane, owing to the very high density in the ring region, may explain the non-detection of \\hhdp. Indeed, our model using a CR rate (\\zeta_{CR}) of 10^{-18} s^{-1} predicts a \\ce{H2D+} surface density of the order of \\sim 10^{12} cm^{-2} close to the current upper limit reported in Table \\ref{tab:col_den}. This limit suggests we are close to detection, and increasing the observation time should assure our chance of detection for \\ce{H2D+}. However, the upper limit on total \\ce{H2D+} is based on the assumption of thermalized ortho-to-para ratio (LTE), with a high correction Boltzmann factor (see Section \\ref{sec:surfden_results}).$\n",

However, based on our current understanding, the outer disk is characterized by lower density and colder temperatures as compared to the ring (refer to Section \\ref{subsec:phy_model}). Lower densities outside the dense ring allow higher CR penetration, leading to non-thermal desorption of CO and \\ce{N2}. Consequently, an increased presence of CO and \\ce{N2} in the gas phase is anticipated in the outer disk, suggesting that the primary pathway for DCO^+ production would be through \\ce{H2D+ + CO}  ([Phuong, Chapillon and Majumdar 2018]()) . On the other hand, \\ce{N2H+} formed through protonation of \\ce{N2} will be readily destroyed in the presence of \\ce{CO}, which will cause a rapid decrease in the \\ce{N2H+} abundances as seen in Figure \\ref{fig:radial_intensity}.$\n",

The discrepancy with observed temperatures can be attributed to our limited understanding of the physical structure of the ring region and the simplifications applied in the model to derive the physical structure}. DCO^+ abundances are sensitive to grain size, and the dust-to-gas mass ratio significantly influences gas-phase molecular abundances. [Gavino, Dutrey and Wakelam (2021)](), [Gavino, Kobus and Dutrey (2023)]() recently investigated the impact of the dependence of the grain size on their temperature. They found that large grains exhibit lower temperatures than smaller ones, \\textbf{with an effect on chemistry that cannot be properly represented by a single grain size.

This is at odds with the predictions from all the chemical models we explored and all the previous studies. Chemical models suggest \\ce{DCO+} peaks at 20-25 K, where some \\ce{CO} remains in the gas phase, and \\ce{N2H+} peaks around 20 K, where \\ce{CO} is fully frozen onto grains. On the contrary, our constraints indicate that both molecules trace regions below the CO layer  ([Phuong and Dutrey 2020]()) , much closer to the midplane than previously thought, with \\ce{N2H+} being the closest.}$\n",
       "$    \\item \\textbf{Our radial distribution of \\dcop emission reveals an atypical partially overlapping double ring structure. The inner ring peaks at 210 \\pm 50 au within the continuum ring region, while the more intense outer ring peaks at 375 \\pm 10 au in the outer disk. We hypothesize that \\ce{DCO+} forms via two different pathways in the ring and the outer disk regions depending on gas-phase CO abundance. In the ring region, \\ce{DCO+} forms through isotope exchange after \\ce{HCO+} arises from \\ce{CO} protonation.}$\n",

       "$    \\item \\textbf{We ran numerous chemical models varying CRI rates, C/O ratios, and stellar UV fluxes. These models suggest that the chemistry of \\ce{H2D+}, \\ce{N2H+}, and \\ce{DCO+} in cold, dense regions is primarily influenced by gas-phase \\ce{CO} abundance and the dominant midplane ion, \\ce{H3+}. These regions are shielded from external UV radiation, making CRI the most crucial factor in determining \\ce{CO} and \\ce{H3+} abundances and, consequently, the distribution of \\ce{N2H+}, \\ce{DCO+}, and \\ce{H2D+}. On the other hand, the chemistry of \\ce{^{13}CS} and \\ce{SO2} is very sensitive to the C/O ratio.}$\n",

The CRI attenuation in the high-density GG Tau A ring can be attributed to an increased number of collisions experienced by CR particles as they gyrate towards the midplane.}$\n",
       "$    \\item The non-detection of \\hhdp (or \\textbf{at best a hint of presence at the 1-2\\sigma level}) suggests that ionization is much lower in the disk-midplane due to its very high density.

Our best-fit model also highlights a low cosmic ray ionization rate (\\zeta_{\\text{CR}}) of 10^{-18} s^{-1}.

       "**Abstract:** Resolved molecular line observations are essential for gaining insight into the physical and chemical structure of protoplanetary disks, particularly in cold, dense regions where planets form and acquire compositions. However, tracing these regions is challenging because most molecules freeze onto grain surfaces and are not observable in the gas phase. We investigated cold molecular chemistry in the triple stellar T Tauri disk GG Tau A, which harbours a massive gas and dust ring and an outer disk, using ALMA Band 7 observations. We present high angular resolution maps of $\\ce{N2H+}$ and $\\ce{DCO+}$ emission, with upper limits reported for $\\ce{H2D+}$ , $^{13}$ CS, and $\\ce{SO2}$ . The radial intensity profile of $\\ce{N2H+}$ shows most emission near the ring outer edge, while $\\ce{DCO+}$ exhibits double peaks, one near the ring inner edge and the other in the outer disk. With complementary observations of lower-lying transitions, we constrained the molecular surface densities and rotation temperatures. We compared the derived quantities with model predictions across different cosmic ray ionization (CRI) rates, carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios, and stellar UV fluxes. **Cold molecular chemistry, affecting \\ce{N2H+**, \\ce{DCO+}, and \\ce{H2D+} abundances, is most sensitive to CRI rates, while stellar UV flux and C/O ratios have minimal impact on these three ions. Our best model requires a low cosmic ray ionization rate of $10^{-18}$ s$^{-1}$. However, it fails to match the low temperatures derived from \\ce{N2H+} and \\ce{DCO+}, 12 to 16 K, which are much lower than the CO freezing temperature.}\n",

       "**Abstract:** Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are a new observational class of phenomena with no clear physical origin. This is at least partially a consequence of limited multi-wavelength follow up of this class of transients in real time. Here we present deep optical ( $g-$ and $i-$ band) photometry with Keck, and prompt radio observations with the VLA of FXT 210423 obtained at $\\delta t \\approx 14-36$ days since the X-ray trigger. We use these multi-band observations, combined with publicly available data sets, to constrain the presence and physical properties of on-axis and off-axis relativistic jets such as those that can be launched by neutron-star mergers and tidal disruption events, which are among the proposed theoretical scenarios of FXTs. Considering a wide range of possible redshifts $z\\le3.5$ , circumstellar medium (CSM) density $n=10^{-6}-10^{-1} \\rm{cm^{-3}}$ , isotropic-equivalent jet kinetic energy $E_{k,iso}=10^{48}-10^{55} \\rm{erg}$ , we find that we can rule out wide jets with opening angle $\\theta_{j}=15◦ee$ viewed within $10◦ee$ off-axis. For more collimated jets ( $\\theta_{j}=3◦ee$ ) we can only rule out on-axis ( $\\theta_{j}=0◦ee$ ) orientations. This study highlights the constraining power of prompt multi-wavelength observations of FXTs discovered in real time by current (e.g., Einstein Probe) and future facilities.\n",

       "**Abstract:** Photometric redshifts are widely used in studies of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs), but catastrophic photo- $z$ failure can undermine all redshift-dependent results. Here we report the spectroscopic redshift confirmation of COSBO-7, a strongly lensed DSFG in the COSMOS-PRIMER field.Recently, using 10 bands of JWST NIRCam and MIRI imaging data on COSBO-7, Ling et al. (2024) reported a photometric redshift solution of $z\\gtrsim7.0$ , favored by four independent spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes, and therefore providing an appealing candidate of the most distant massive DSFG. This photo- $z$ solution was also supported by a single line detection in ALMA Band 3 consistent with CO(7-6) at $z=7.46$ .However, our new ALMA observations robustly detect two lines in Band 6 identified as CO(7-6) and [ CI ] (2-1) at $z_{\\rm spec}=2.625$ , and thus the Band 3 line as CO(3-2). The three robust line detections decidedly place COSBO-7  at $z=2.625$ , refuting the photo- $z$ solution.We derive physical parameters by fitting NIR-to-mm photometry and lens modeling, revealing that COSBO-7 is a main-sequence galaxy.We examine possible reasons for this photo- $z$ failure and attribute it to (1) the likely underestimation of photometric uncertainty at 0.9 $\\mu$ m, and (2) the lack of photometry at wavelengths beyond 20 $\\mu$ m.Notably, we recover a bona-fide $z_{\\rm phot}\\sim 2.3$ by including the existing MIPS $24 \\mu$ m photometry, demonstrating the critical importance of mid-infrared data for photo- $z$ robustness.This work highlights a common challenge in modeling SEDs of DSFGs, cautioning against the reliability of photometric redshifts, as well as pseudo-spectroscopic redshifts based on single line detection.\n",

       "**Abstract:** ${Current ALMA surveys often underestimate protoplanetary disk sizes as many disks have extended low surface-brightness regions that fall below ALMA's detection limits. To effectively capture faint millimeter continuum emission in these outer regions, increased sensitivity is required.}$ In order to gain insights on the ${connection between disk structure and}$ planet formation, we aim to uncover ${continuum}$ emission in the outer regions of the disk around TW Hya. ${Additionally, we aim to investigate the evolution of this disk by studying its dust properties.}$ We present Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of TW Hya at 0.65 mm with $\\sim$ 0.5 arcsecond angular resolution, together with high angular resolution archival ${observations}$ at 0.87 mm, 1.3 mm, 2.1 mm and 3.1 mm. We constrain the outer disk emission ${with both image-plane retrieval, and visibility-plane modeling with non-parametric and parametric fitting tools.}$ Our results confirm emission in the outer disk regions of TW Hya (60 au $\\leq$ R $\\leq$ 110 au) at 0.65 mm, 0.87 mm and 1.3 mm. ${With image-plane retrieval}$ , we resolve the new continuum gap and ring, namely D79 and B86, at 0.87 mm and 1.3 mm. ${With visibility-plane modeling}$ , we also detect this substructure at 0.65 mm, and it is consistent in location with the outer ring proposed by \\citealp{ilee}{at the 1$\\sigma$ level} . ${Furthermore, it}$ has a high spectral index of 3.7, which may indicate dust grain sizes $\\ll$ 1 mm. It may be a dust trap or a traffic jam, that has a flux density of $\\sim$ 60 mJy and a mass (1.59 $M_\\oplus$ ) that accounts for up to 2 \\% of the dust disk at 0.65 mm. We confirm the existence of a faint ring in the outer regions of TW Hya at multiple millimeter wavelengths. ${With visibility-plane modeling, we are able to set constrains that are 3 times better than the resolution of our Band 8 observations.}$\n",

       "**Abstract:** Young brown dwarfs exhibit atmospheric characteristics similar to those of super-Jupiters, providing a unique opportunity to study planetary atmospheres. Atmospheric retrievals of high-resolution spectra reveal detailed properties of these objects, with elemental and isotopic ratios offering insights into their formation history. The ESO SupJup Survey, utilising CRIRES $^+$ on the Very Large Telescope, aims to assess the role of $\\Cratio$ as a formation tracer. We present observations of three young brown dwarfs: 2MASS J12003792-7845082, TWA 28, and 2MASS J08561384-1342242. Our goal is to constrain their chemical compositions, thermal profiles, surface gravities, spin rotations, and $\\Cratio$ . We conducted atmospheric retrievals of CRIRES $^+$ K-band spectra, coupling the radiative transfer code \\texttt{petitRADTRANS} with the Bayesian inference algorithm \\texttt{MultiNest} . The retrievals provide a detailed characterisation of the atmospheres of the three objects. We report the volume mixing ratios of the main molecular and atomic species: $\\sixteenOwater$ , $\\twelveCO$ , HF, Na, Ca, and Ti, including the novel detection of hydrogen fluoride (HF) in the atmosphere of a brown dwarf. We determine $\\Cratio$ values of $81^{+28}_{-19}$ and $79^{+20}_{-14}$ in the atmospheres of TWA 28 and J0856, respectively, with strong significance ( $>3\\sigma$ ). We also report tentative evidence ( $\\sim 2\\sigma$ ) of $\\thirteenCO$ in J1200, at $\\Cratio$ = $114^{+69}_{-33}$ . Additionally, we detect $\\eighteenOwater$ at moderate significance in J0856 (3.3 $\\sigma$ ) and TWA 28 (2.1 $\\sigma$ ). The retrieved thermal profiles are consistent with hot atmospheres ( $2300-2600$ K) with low surface gravities and slow spins, as expected for young objects. The measured carbon isotope ratios are consistent among the three objects and show no significant deviation from that of the local interstellar medium, suggesting a fragmentation-based formation mechanism similar to star formation. The tentative detection of $\\eighteenOwater$ in two objects of our sample highlights the potential of high-resolution spectroscopy to probe additional isotope ratios, such as $\\ratio{O}{16}{18}$ , in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and super-Jupiters.\n",
