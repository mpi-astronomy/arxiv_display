       "|**Abstract**|            Maps of polarized dust emission of molecular clouds reveal the morphology of the magnetic field associated with star-forming regions. In particular, polarization maps of hub-filament systems show the distortion of magnetic field lines induced by gas flows onto and inside filaments. We aim to understand the relation between the curvature of magnetic field lines associated with filaments in hub-filament systems and the properties of the underlying gas flows. We consider steady-state models of gas with finite electrical resistivity flowing across a transverse magnetic field. We derive the relation between the bending of the field lines and the flow parameters represented by the Alfvén Mach number and the magnetic Reynolds number. We find that, on the scale of the filaments, the relevant parameter for a gas of finite electrical resistivity is the magnetic Reynolds number, and we derive the relation between the deflection angle of the field from the initial direction (assumed perpendicular to the filament) and the value of the electrical resistivity, due to either Ohmic dissipation or ambipolar diffusion. Application of this model to specific observations of polarized dust emission in filamentary clouds shows that magnetic Reynolds numbers of a few tens are required to reproduce the data. Despite significant uncertainties in the observations (the flow speed, the geometry and orientation of the filament), and the idealization of the model, the specific cases considered show that ambipolar diffusion can provide the resistivity needed to maintain a steady state flow across magnetic fields of significant strength over realistic time scales.         |"

       "|**Abstract**|            Reverberation mapping accurately determines virial black hole masses only for redshifts $z <$ 0.2 by utilizing the relationship between the H$\\beta$ broad-line region (BLR) size and the 5100 Angstroms continuum luminosity established with $\\sim 200$ active galactic nuclei (AGN). For quasars at $z \\sim 2-3$ determining the BLR size is time-consuming and limited by seasonal gaps, requiring e.g., $\\sim$ 20 years of monitoring of the CIV emission lines. In this work, we demonstrate that an efficient alternative is to use a continuum size-luminosity relation, which can be obtained up to 150 times faster than BLR sizes using photometric reverberation mapping (PRM). We outline the method and its feasibility based on simulations and propose an observational strategy that can be carried out with meter-class telescopes. In particular, we focus on the ESO La Silla 2.2 meter telescope as it is suitable for an efficient PRM campaign. These observations will provide the scaling factor between the accretion disk and the BLR size (for CIV-1350 Angstroms), which is crucial for estimating the masses of black holes at higher redshifts ($z \\gtrsim 2-3$).         |"

The study aims to identify optimal conditions for stellar collisions in different stellar systems leading to the formation of very massive stars that subsequently collapse into black holes. Data from numerical simulations and observations of diverse stellar systems are analyzed, encompassing various initial conditions, initial mass functions, and stellar evolution scenarios. We compute a critical mass, determined by the interplay of collision time, system age, and initial properties of the star cluster. The efficiency of black hole formation ($\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{BH}}$) is defined as the ratio of initial stellar mass divided by critical mass. The study finds out that stellar systems with a ratio of initial stellar mass over critical mass above 1 exhibit high efficiencies of black hole formation, ranging from $30-100\\%$. While there is some scatter, potentially attributed to complex system histories and the presence of gas, the results highlight the potential for achieving high efficiencies through a purely collisional channel in black hole formation. In conclusion, this theoretical exploration elucidates the connection between star clusters and black hole formation. The study underscores the significance of UCDs, GCs, and NSCs as environments conducive to stellar collisions leading to black hole formation. The defined black hole formation efficiency ($\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{BH}}$) is shown to be influenced by the ratio of initial stellar mass to critical mass.         |"

       "|**Abstract**|            To investigate the short-term variability and determine the size of the optical continuum emitting size of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), we carried out high-cadence, multi-band photometric monitoring of a Seyfert 1 galaxy J0249-0815 across two nights, together with a one-night single-band preliminary test. The presence of the broad Ha component in our target was confirmed by recent Palomar/P200 spectroscopic observations, 23 years after Sloan Digital Sky Survey, ruling out the supernovae origin of the broad Ha line. The photometric experiment was primarily conducted utilizing four-channel imagers MuSCAT 3 & 4 mounted on 2-meter telescopes within the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network. Despite the expectation of variability, we observed no significant variation (<1.4%) on timescales of 6-10 hours. This non-detection is likely due to substantial host galaxy light diluting the subtle AGN variability. Dual-band preliminary tests and tailored simulations may enhance the possibility of detecting variability and lag in future IMBH reverberation campaigns.         |\n",

       "**Abstract:** Maps of polarized dust emission of molecular clouds reveal themorphology of the magnetic field associated with star-forming regions.In particular, polarization maps of hub-filament systems show thedistortion of  magnetic field lines induced by gas flows onto andinside filaments. We aim to understand the relation between the curvature of magneticfield lines associated with filaments in hub-filament systems and theproperties of the underlying gas flows. We consider steady-state models of gas with finite electricalresistivity flowing across a transverse magnetic field. We derivethe relation between the bending of the field lines and the flowparameters represented by the Alfvén Mach number and the magneticReynolds number. We find that, on the scale of the filaments, the relevant parameterfor a gas of finite electrical resistivity is the magnetic Reynoldsnumber, and we derive the relation between the deflection angle ofthe field from the initial direction (assumed perpendicular to thefilament) and the value of the electrical resistivity, due to eitherOhmic dissipation or ambipolar diffusion. Application of this model to specific observations of polarizeddust emission in filamentary clouds shows that magnetic Reynoldsnumbers of a few tens are required to reproduce the data. Despitesignificant uncertainties in the observations (the flow speed, thegeometry and orientation of the filament), and the idealizationof the model, the specific cases considered show that ambipolardiffusion can provide the resistivity needed to maintain asteady state flow across magnetic fields of significant strengthover realistic time scales.\n",

       "**Abstract:** Reverberation mapping accurately determines virial black hole masses only for redshifts $z <$ 0.2 by utilizing the relationship between the $\\hb$ broad-line region (BLR) size and the 5100Å continuum luminosity established with $\\sim 200$ active galactic nuclei (AGN). For quasars at $z \\sim 2-3$ determining the BLR size is time-consuming and limited by seasonal gaps, requiring e.g., $\\sim$ 20 years of monitoring of the $\\civ$ emission lines. In this work, we demonstrate that an efficient alternative is to use a continuum size-luminosity relation, which can be obtained up to 150 times faster than BLR sizes using photometric reverberation mapping (PRM). We outline the method and its feasibility based on simulations and propose an observational strategy that can be carried out with meter-class telescopes. In particular, we focus on the ESO La Silla 2.2 meter telescope as it is suitable for an efficient PRM campaign.These observations will provide the scaling factor between the accretion disk and the BLR size (for $\\civ$ -1350Å), which is crucial for estimating the masses of black holes at higher redshifts ( $z \\gtrsim 2-3$ ).\n",

       "**Abstract:** This paper explores the theoretical relation between star clusters and black holes within, focusing on the potential role of Nuclear Star Clusters ( NSCs ), Globular Clusters ( GCs ), and Ultra Compact Dwarf Galaxies ( UCDs ) as environments that lead to black hole formation through stellar collisions. The study aims to identify optimal conditions for stellar collisions in different stellar systems leading to the formation of very massive stars that subsequently collapse into black holes. Data from numerical simulations and observations of diverse stellar systems are analyzed, encompassing various initial conditions, initial mass functions, and stellar evolution scenarios. We compute a critical mass, determined by the interplay of collision time, system age, and initial properties of the star cluster. The efficiency of black hole formation ( $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{BH}}$ ) is defined as the ratio of initial stellar mass divided by critical mass. The study finds out that stellar systems with a ratio of initial stellar mass over critical mass above 1 exhibit high efficiencies of black hole formation, ranging from $30-100\\%$ . While there is some scatter, potentially attributed to complex system histories and the presence of gas, the results highlight the potential for achieving high efficiencies through a purely collisional channel in black hole formation. In conclusion, this theoretical exploration elucidates the connection between star clusters and black hole formation. The study underscores the significance of UCDs , GCs , and NSCs as environments conducive to stellar collisions leading to black hole formation. The defined black hole formation efficiency ( $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{BH}}$ ) is shown to be influenced by the ratio of initial stellar mass to critical mass.\n",
