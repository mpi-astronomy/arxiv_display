       "|**Abstract**| We present high-precision radial velocity (RV) observations of Gaia BH1, the nearest known black hole (BH). The system contains a solar-type G star orbiting a massive dark companion, which could be either a single BH or an inner BH + BH binary. A BH + BH binary is expected in some models where Gaia BH1 formed as a hierarchical triple, which are attractive because they avoid many of the difficulties associated with forming the system through isolated binary evolution. Our observations test the inner binary scenario. We have measured 115 precise RVs of the G star, including 40 from ESPRESSO with a precision of $3$-$5$ m s$^{-1}$, and 75 from other instruments with a typical precision of $30$-$100$ m s$^{-1}$. Our observations span $2.33$ orbits of the G star and are concentrated near a periastron passage, when perturbations due to an inner binary would be largest. The RVs are well-fit by a Keplerian two-body orbit and show no convincing evidence of an inner binary. Using REBOUND simulations of hierarchical triples with a range of inner periods, mass ratios, eccentricities, and orientations, we show that plausible inner binaries with periods $P_{\\text{inner}} \\gtrsim 1.5$ days would have produced larger deviations from a Keplerian orbit than observed. Binaries with $P_{\\text{inner}} \\lesssim 1.5$ days are consistent with the data, but these would merge within a Hubble time and would thus imply fine-tuning. We present updated parameters of Gaia BH1's orbit. The RVs yield a spectroscopic mass function $f\\left(M_{\\text{BH}}\\right)=3.9358 \\pm 0.0002\\,M_{\\odot}$ - about $7000\\sigma$ above the $\\sim2.5\\,M_{\\odot}$ maximum neutron star mass. Including the inclination constraint from Gaia astrometry, this implies a BH mass of $M_{\\text{BH}} = 9.27 \\pm 0.10 ~ M_{\\odot}$. |"

       "|**Abstract**| We present the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS)-AstroSat atlas, which contains ultraviolet imaging of 31 nearby star-forming galaxies captured by the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on the AstroSat satellite. The atlas provides a homogeneous data set of far- and near-ultraviolet maps of galaxies within a distance of 22 Mpc and a median angular resolution of 1.4 arcseconds (corresponding to a physical scale between 25 and 160 pc). After subtracting a uniform ultraviolet background and accounting for Milky Way extinction, we compare our estimated flux densities to GALEX observations, finding good agreement. We find candidate extended UV disks around the galaxies NGC 6744 and IC 5332. We present the first statistical measurements of the clumping of the UV emission and compare it to the clumping of molecular gas traced with ALMA. We find that bars and spiral arms exhibit the highest degree of clumping, and the molecular gas is even more clumped than the FUV emission in galaxies. We investigate the variation of the ratio of observed FUV to H$\\alpha$ in different galactic environments and kpc-sized apertures. We report that $\\sim 65 \\%$ varation of the $\\log_{10}$(FUV/H$\\alpha$) can be described through a combination of dust attenuation with star formation history parameters. The PHANGS-AstroSat atlas enhances the multi-wavelength coverage of our sample, offering a detailed perspective on star formation. When integrated with PHANGS data sets from ALMA, VLT-MUSE, HST and JWST, it develops our comprehensive understanding of attenuation curves and dust attenuation in star-forming galaxies. |"

       "|**Abstract**| We report near-infrared long-baseline interferometric observations of the Hyades multiple system HD 284163, made with the CHARA array, as well as almost 43 yr of high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring at the CfA. Both types of observations resolve the 2.39 d inner binary, and also an outer companion in a 43.1 yr orbit. Our observations, combined with others from the literature, allow us to solve for the 3D inner and outer orbits, which are found to be at nearly right angles to each other. We determine the dynamical masses of the three stars (good to better than 1.4% for the inner pair), as well as the orbital parallax. The secondary component (0.5245 +/- 0.0047 MSun) is now the lowest mass star with a dynamical mass measurement in the cluster. A comparison of these measurements with current stellar evolution models for the age and metallicity of the Hyades shows good agreement. All three stars display significant levels of chromospheric activity, consistent with the classification of HD 284163 as an RS CVn object. We present evidence that a more distant fourth star is physically associated, making this a hierarchical quadruple system. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| Globular clusters harbor numerous millisecond pulsars; however, the detection of long-period pulsars within these clusters has been notably scarce. The search for long-period pulsars encounters significant challenges due to pronounced red noise interference, necessitating the crucial step of red noise removal in the data preprocessing. In this study, we use running median filtering to mitigate red noise in multiple globular cluster datasets obtained through observations with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Additionally, we estimated the minimum detectable flux density of pulsars ($S_{\\rm min}$) considering this processing step, resulting in a function depicting how $S_{\\rm min}$ varies with different duty cycles and periods. Subsequently, a systematic search for long-period pulsars was conducted on the globular cluster datasets after red noise elimination. Ultimately, two isolated long-period pulsars were discovered in the M15 globular cluster, with periods of approximately 1.928451 seconds and 3.960716 seconds, both exhibiting remarkably low pulse duty cycles of around 1\\%. Using archived data, we obtained timing solutions for these pulsars. Based on the timing results, their positions are found to be close to the center of the M15 cluster. On the $P-\\dot{P}$ diagram, they both lie below the spin-up line, suggesting that their recycling process was likely interrupted, leading them to become isolated pulsars. Moreover, in our current search, these very faint long-period pulsars are exclusively identified in M15, and one possible reason for this could be the relatively close proximity and extremely high stellar formation rate of M15. As observational data accumulate and search algorithms undergo iterative enhancements, the prospect of discovering additional long-period pulsars within globular clusters, such as M15, becomes increasingly promising. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| We present the discovery of three pulsars in Globular Cluster M15 (NGC 7078) by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). In the three pulsars, PSR~J2129+1210J (M15J) is a millisecond pulsar with a spinning period of 11.84 ms and a dispersion measure of 66.68 pc cm$^{-3}$. Both PSR~J2129+1210K and L (M15K and L) are long period pulsars with spinning periods of 1928 ms and 3961 ms , respectively, while M15L is the GC pulsar with the longest spinning period till now. The discoveries of M15K and L support the theory that core-collapsed Globular Clusters may contain partially recycled long period pulsars. With the same dataset, the timing solutions of M15A to H were updated, and the timing parameter P1 of M15F is different from the previous results, which is approximately 0.027$\\times 10^{-18} ss^{-1}$ from our work and $0.032 \\times 10^{-18} ss^{-1}$ from Anderson's\\citep{anderson-1993}. As predicted by Rodolfi et al. , the luminosity of M15C kept decreasing and the latest detection in our dataset is on December 20$^{\\rm th}$, 2022. We also detected M15I for one more time. The different barycentric spin periods indicate that this pulsar should locate in a binary system, manifesting itself as the exceptional one in such a core-collapsing GC. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| Carbon stars are excellent kinematic tracers of galaxies and play important roles in understanding the evolution of the Galaxy. Therefore, it is worthwhile to search for them in a large amount of spectra. In this work, we build a new carbon star catalog based on the LAMOST DR7 spectra. The catalog contains 4542 spectra of 3546 carbon stars, identified through line index and near-infrared color-color diagrams. Through visual inspection of the spectra, we further subclassify them into 925 C--H, 384 C--R, 608 C--N, and 1292 Ba stars. However, 437 stars could not be sub-classified due to their low signal-to-noise. Moreover, by comparing with LAMOST DR7 pipeline we find 567 more carbon stars and visually sub-classify them. We find that on the $J-H$ vs. $H-K_{\\rm s}$ two-color diagram, C--N stars can be reliably distinguished from the other three sub-types. Additionally, by utilizing the Gaia distance, we study the distribution of carbon stars in the H-R diagram and identify 258 dwarf carbon stars by the criterion $M_{\\rm G}>$5.0\\,mag. Finally, we present the spatial distribution in Galactic coordinates of the 3546 carbon stars. The majority of C-N, C-R, and Ba stars are distributed at low Galactic latitudes, while most C--H and dC stars distribute at high Galactic latitudes. |\n",

       "**Abstract:** We present high-precision radial velocity (RV) observations of Gaia BH1, the nearest known black hole (BH). The system contains a solar-type G star orbiting a massive dark companion, which could be either a single BH or an inner BH + BH binary. A BH + BH binary is expected in some models where Gaia BH1 formed as a hierarchical triple, which are attractive because they avoid many of the difficulties associated with forming the system through isolated binary evolution. Our observations test the inner binary scenario. We have measured 115 precise RVs of the G star, including 40 from ESPRESSO with a precision of $3$ -- $5$ m s $^{-1}$ , and 75 from other instruments with a typical precision of $30$ -- $100$ m s $^{-1}$ . Our observations span $2.33$ orbits of the G star and are concentrated near a periastron passage, when perturbations due to an inner binary would be largest. The RVs are well-fit by a Keplerian two-body orbit and show no convincing evidence of an inner binary. Using \\texttt{REBOUND} simulations of hierarchical triples with a range of inner periods, mass ratios, eccentricities, and orientations, we show that plausible inner binaries with periods $P_{\\text{inner}} \\gtrsim 1.5$ days would have produced larger deviations from a Keplerian orbit than observed. Binaries with $P_{\\text{inner}} \\lesssim 1.5$ days are consistent with the data, but these would merge within a Hubble time and would thus imply fine-tuning. We present updated parameters of Gaia BH1's orbit. The RVs yield a spectroscopic mass function $f\\left(M_{\\text{BH}}\\right)=3.9358 \\pm 0.0002 M_{\\odot}$ --- about $7000\\sigma$ above the $\\sim2.5 M_{\\odot}$ maximum neutron star mass. Including the inclination constraint from $_ Gaia_$ astrometry, this implies a BH mass of $M_{\\text{BH}} = 9.27 \\pm 0.10   M_{\\odot}$ .\n",

       "**Figure 1. -** Orbital configuration (left) and predicted RVs (right) of the hierarchical triple scenario we seek to test. RVs are measured for a Sun-like star orbiting an inner BH + BH binary. In the general case, the inner and outer orbits are both eccentric and non-coplanar. The parameters of the outer orbit are fixed to those inferred for Gaia BH1 by \\citetalias{Gaia_BH1}. Here we assume an equal-mass inner binary with period $P_{\\text{inner}} = 6$ days and eccentricity $e_{\\text{inner}} = 0.1$. While the RVs of the Sun-like star are nearly consistent with a Keplerian orbit (upper right), subtraction of the best-fit Keplerian orbit reveals significant residuals (lower right).  At $P_{\\text{inner}} = 6$ days, the amplitude of the RV residuals is $\\sim$250 m s$^{-1}$ near periastron. (*fig:intro_fig*)\n",

Different panels show different orientations of the inner binary, and lines within each panel show different inner binary eccentricities. The reduced $\\chi^2$ value generally increases with increasing $e_{\\text{inner}}$. At very high $e_{\\text{inner}}$, the non-uniform sampling of our RVs gives rise to oscillations in the reduced $\\chi^2$ value. Based on our best-fit model's reduced $\\chi^2$ value of $1.69$, we can rule out most inner binaries with $P_{\\text{inner}} \\gtrsim 1.5$ days.

       "$We present the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS)-{\\it AstroSat} atlas, which contains ultraviolet imaging of 31 nearby star-forming galaxies captured by the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on the  \\textit{AstroSat} satellite. The atlas news a homogeneous data set of far- and near-ultraviolet maps of galaxies within a distance of 22 Mpc and a median angular resolution of 1.4 arcseconds (corresponding to a physical scale between 25 and 160 pc). After subtracting a uniform ultraviolet background and accounting for Milky Way extinction, we compare our estimated flux densities to GALEX observations, finding good agreement. We find candidate extended UV disks around the galaxies NGC 6744 and IC 5332. We present the first statistical measurements of the clumping of the UV emission and compare it to the clumping of molecular gas traced with ALMA. We find that bars and spiral arms exhibit the highest degree of clumping, and the molecular gas is even more clumped than the FUV emission in galaxies. We investigate the variation of the ratio of observed FUV to H\\alpha in different galactic environments and kpc-sized apertures. We report that \\sim 65\\% varation of the \\log_{10}(FUV/H\\alpha) can be described through a combination of dust attenuation with star formation history parameters. The PHANGS-{\\it AstroSat} atlas enhances the multi-wavelength coverage of our sample, offering a detailed perspective on star formation. When integrated with PHANGS data sets  from ALMA, VLT-MUSE, HST and JWST, it develops our comprehensive understanding of attenuation curves and dust attenuation in star-forming galaxies.\\end{abstract}$\n",

       "$The high-mass stellar population of a galaxy plays a central role in galactic evolution. High-mass stars, which are short-lived and must have formed recently, change the colors of galaxies and new the mechanical and radiative feedback that determine the future evolution of the system  ([Krumholz, Bate and Arce 2014]()) .  Beyond the Local Group, our study of these young, massive stars relies on their photospheric emission, which is directly traced in the near- and far-ultraviolet and indirectly observed using recombination line emission in the optical (e.g., H\\alpha) and reprocessing from dust  ([Kennicutt and Evans 2012]()) .$\n",
       "$Studying ultraviolet (UV) emission from nearby extragalactic targets traces star formation over a longer time scale (100-200 Myr) in comparison to other typical tracers, such as recombination lines \\citep[5-20 Myr;][]{kennicutt12}. To understand the UV spectral behaviour of young stellar populations located beyond the optical disk, both large fields-of-view (FoV) and multi-band UV imaging are essential. The latter feature is a key to constraining the attenuation properties along with the UV color  ([Decleir and Boquien 2019]()) . Moreover, because of its sensitivity to small numbers of high-mass stars, UV emission news a good tracer of star formation beyond optical disks  ([Thilker, Bianchi and Meurer 2007]()) , and more generally in galactic environments characterized by low density  ([Lee and Kennicutt 2011]()) .$\n",
       "$In the past decades, several telescopes such as the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory's Ultraviolet Optical Telescope (UVOT) have mapped UV bands in nearby galaxies  ([Lee and Kennicutt 2011](), [Rampazzo, Mazzei and Marino 2017](), [Leroy, Sandstrom and Lang 2019]()) . GALEX newd imaging in the near-UV (NUV; 2500 Å) and far-UV (FUV; 1500 Å) with a field of view of \\sim1.28^{\\circ} and angular resolution of 4 to 6\\arcsec, respectively$\n",
       "$ ([Martin, Fanson and Schiminovich 2005]()) . On the other hand, Swift-UVOT has three UV bands with a smaller FoV (17\\arcmin) and an angular resolution of \\sim2.5\\arcsec  ([Roming, Kennedy and Mason 2005]()) . Many insights about nearby galaxy populations have been derived from GALEX, combined with multiwaveband results, which have newd a rich understanding of galaxy evolution and the impacts of star formation \\citep[e.g.,][]{Salim2007,GildePaz2007_GALEX_ATLAS, Leroy_2008, lee2009}.$\n",
       "$The Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on the {\\it AstroSat} mission offers an improvement in  resolution for imaging energetic UV photons with multiple UV bands. It extends the legacy of GALEX/SWIFT by effectively resolving the structures of star-forming regions, thanks to its <1.8\\arcsec resolution  ([Kumar, Ghosh and Hutchings 2012](), [Singh, Tandon and Agrawal 2014]()) . UVIT observes in 9 bands, covering the range from 1480 Å to 2790 Å, with a 28\\arcmin FoV   ([Rahna, Murthy and Safonova 2017]()) . The data from AstroSat UVIT can be utilized to discern and model both the age and mass of young stellar populations, ranging from approximately 5-200 Myr and with masses greater than 10^{3-4} M_{\\odot}  \\citep[e.g.;][]{Ujjwal}. Many of these populations are located beyond R_{25}, i.e. the radius at which the surface brightness falls below 25 magnitudes per square arcsecond in the B-band.$\n",
       "$Sensitive, wide-field UV observations are even more powerful when combined with probes of the different phases of the ISM and stellar populations. The star formation process, as traced by the NUV and FUV, offers valuable insight when aligned with other tracers of star formation phases. CO observations, which trace molecular gas, identify dust-shrouded star-forming regions, areas where UV photons can quickly destroy clumps. Observations of ionized gas, captured through hydrogen recombination lines, showcase the re-emission stemming from the Extreme UV (EUV) of the highest mass stars.$\n",
       "$Integrating the UV observations from nearby galaxies with a spatial resolution below 200 pc can enhance the comprehensive understanding advanced by projects like the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) collaboration.  The PHANGS-ALMA survey  ([Leroy, Schinnerer and Hughes 2021]())  yielded \\sim1\\arcsec resolution observations of CO(2-1) emission from molecular clouds in 90 nearby galaxies.  Similarly, PHANGS-MUSE used VLT/MUSE observations to map out optical emission line from 19 of the 90 ALMA targets, also at \\lesssim 1\\arcsec resolution.  The PHANGS-{\\it AstroSat} news an essential complement to the UV imaging obtained by the PHANGS-HST survey  ([Lee, Whitmore and Thilker 2022]())  which only probes to \\sim2500Å, but achieves an angular resolution of 0\\farcs08 over the smaller fields-of-view of the WFC3 camera. In this work, we compare the new UV data to these other tracers of the star formation process to understand how galaxies evolve at these arcsecond scales.$\n",
       "$One of the main drivers of galaxy evolution is the relationship between gas and star formation called the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation  ([ and Kennicutt 1998]()) , which presents a tight correlation between the surface densities of gas and star formation on large scales (>1~\\mathrm{kpc}) in galaxies. However, several studies indicate that this relation operates on kpc scales and it may break down at smaller scales \\cite[e.g.][]{Bigiel2008,Kruijssen2019}. While these results typically rely on recombination line tracers of star formation, {\\it AstroSat} imaging can play a key role in estimating the link between star formation and the amount of molecular gas over longer timescales.  UV observation can make progress even in the outskirts of galaxies, where the fraction of molecular relative to neutral gas is low. However, we should note that simulations such as those by [Khoperskov and Vasiliev (2017)]() have shown that the relation between UV-based star formation rates and the total amount of gas at 50-pc resolution is unclear, and observations suggest that the KS relation prescription cannot be extrapolated to the low-density environments of outer galaxy disks  ([Dessauges-Zavadsky, et. al 2014]()) . These findings underscore the need for high-resolution investigations of UV-based star formation processes beyond the optical disks of galaxies.$\n",
       "$The relationship between UV and H\\alpha luminosities news valuable information on dust content, the age of stellar populations, and the metallicity of galaxies. Previous studies \\citep[e.g., ][]{lee2009, lee11} have attempted to uncover the details of the UV-H\\alpha relation with a focus on understanding recipes for the integrated star formation rate in galaxies. However, the dependence of this relation on the actual amount of molecular gas and dust reddening remains unclear. Furthermore, there is a lack of detailed information on how the ratio changes across different environments within galaxies, such as bars, centres, and spiral arms at small scales.  The ionized gas traced by H\\alpha and observed through MUSE/VLT observations with the PHANGS-MUSE survey offers a new perspective on recent star formation up to 10 million years ago as well as dust reddening  ([Emsellem, Schinnerer and Santoro 2022]()) .  When combined with the new UVIT observations, we will be able to directly relate changing UV-to-H\\alpha to the local environment in these galaxies.$\n",
       "$In this paper, we present a homogeneous data set of UV images of 31 nearby galaxies observed by {\\it AstroSat} in the wavelength range of 1480 Å  to 2790 Å. Our main focus is to reduce and assess the quality of the data set and compare it with previous low-resolution observations. Additionally, we study the variation of the UV and molecular gas clumpiness in different morphological regions of galaxies. By comparing the FUV to H\\alpha flux in different galaxies, we aim to new predictive models for the ratio in different environments. This work is expected to contribute to the interpretation of different tracers of star formation at high resolution (<200 pc) and new a quantitative framework for the relation between UV and H\\alpha luminosity.$\n",
       "$In Section \\ref{sec:sample_selection}, we present our sample selection strategies and then the observations. We focus on the reduction and quality assessment of our data in Section \\ref{sec:procs}. Then, we present two new XUV disk candidates in Section \\ref{sec:xuv} and new details about the clumping of UV and CO emission at high resolution (\\lesssim 1.5\") in Section \\ref{sec:clumping}. Finally, we compare the luminosity of FUV to H\\alpha emission to show how these two star formation tracers vary in different morphological parts of galaxies and how their ratio depends on dust attenuation, star formation history parameters, and the equivalent width (EW) of the H\\alpha emission (Section \\ref{sec:fuvha}).$\n",

       "$To maximize the opportunity for multiwavelength science, we selected galaxies that have been observed as part of the PHANGS survey for observation using {\\it AstroSat}.  The primary PHANGS sample consists of 90 nearby galaxies observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array \\citep[ALMA,][]{Leroy2021} in molecular line emission.  These targets are selected to be nearby (D<22~\\mathrm{Mpc}) so a high efficiency observation with ALMA yields high quality maps of the molecular interstellar medium with \\sim 1\" resolution. The proximity of the targets means that the 1\" resolution translates into small physical scales, providing a robust census of star-forming galaxies at \\sim 100 pc linear resolution, which matches the typical scale heights of galaxies  ([Sun, Leroy and Ostriker 2020]())  and the size of giant molecular clouds  ([Rosolowsky, Hughes and Leroy 2021]()) . The emission lines were observed at the rest frequency of \\nu=230.538~GHz (Band 6), where the combination of receiver sensitivity and atmospheric transparency makes ALMA most efficient for 1\" scale mapping of molecular gas. The ALMA data set news a unique, \\sim1\\arcsec (100~pc at 20 Mpc) view of nearby main-sequence galaxies at GMCs scale.$\n",
       "$The median of 1\\sigma noise in the cube of all targets is estimated to be 6.2 mJy beam^{-1} at native resolution (corresponding to a brightness temperature of \\sim 0.17~K). The velocity resolution of 2.5 km~s^{-1} is chosen to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and quality of the deconvolution process. These observations were conducted using a bandwidth of 937.5  MHz with a channel width of \\Delta \\nu = 244 kHz. In contrast to UV observations from {\\it AstroSat}, ALMA maps only cover the infrared-bright portion of the inner disk (R_\\mathrm{gal}=5-6 kpc) of our targets. Final data products are released using two different signal-selection masks, both indicating the likely location of real CO emission inside each cube. In this study, we used high completeness “broad” mask which is better for the detection of diffuse emission from the galaxy. The broad mask is built by convolving the cube into several lower resolution cubes and then a mask was created. Along with zero-moment maps that we used in this study, the uncertainty maps are also newd based on a three-dimensional noise model \\citep[][, their section 7.2]{Leroy2021}.$\n",

This sample encompasses 19 nearby star-forming spiral galaxies, as described by [Emsellem, Schinnerer and Santoro (2022)](). Out of these, 15 targets are also included in the PHANGS-{\\it AstroSat} observations. The entire program took a total telescope time of \\sim 172 hours and each target has been observed with 3 to 15 pointings to cover the disk of the galaxy. Observations were conducted using MUSE wide-field mode (WFM; FoV = 1\\arcmin), using the nominal (non-extended) wavelength from 4800 to 9300 Å. The spectral resolution varies with wavelength but is typically around 2.75 Å~(Full Width at Half Maximum, FWHM). The median Point Spread Function of the sample has a 0.69\\arcsec  FWHM at 6483.5 Å. We use the emission line maps from [Emsellem, Schinnerer and Santoro (2022)](), which are created through the MUSE Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP) that fits each emission line along with the properties of the underlying stellar continuum. In this work, we use the H\\alpha and H\\beta emission lines as well as an estimate of the light-weighted stellar population ages determined from fits to the stellar spectra  ([Emsellem, Schinnerer and Santoro 2022]()) .$\n",

These GALEX maps are background-subtracted for UV background emission and corrected for foreground Galactic extinction. In our quality assessment analysis, we employ GALEX maps which are convolved to an angular resolution of 7\\farcs5, in accordance with the  ([Leroy, Sandstrom and Lang 2019]())  dataset.$\n",

In this study, we only propagate the uncertainty in CPS as the UC errors are taken to be small. These uncertainties yield 5\\% uncertainty in the flux density for each filter  ([Singh, Ashby and Vig 2021]()) . We align each image along the cardinal directions by reprojecting with the \\textsc{reproject} python package\\footnote{\\url{https://reproject.readthedocs.io/en/stable/}}. Because the Point Spread Function (PSF) is minimally-sampled, we found that the adaptive resampling method was sufficient to maintain flux conservation in the reprojected image. Other interpolation and flux conserving methods produced a Moiré artifact pattern in the reprojected image, which was also noted by [Clark, Verstocken and Bianchi (2018)](), where they increased the pixel size in the reprojected image to avoid this artifact. Using the adaptive resampling method in \\textsc{reproject}, we can maintain the same pixel scales as the original images. The final images have a pixel size of 0.42\\arcsec. As an example, we show a large panel of NGC~1566 FUV (F148W) map with environmental masks adopted from [Querejeta, Schinnerer and Meidt (2021)]() in different colors and 1-kpc size hexagonal apertures in Fig \\ref{fig:NGC1566}.

Most galaxies have observations in the F148W filter, except NGC~1433, NGC~1512, NGC~4321, NGC~4571, NGC~4476, NGC~4579, and NGC~4254 which are in the F154W filter.

       "$To minimize the impact of the FUV bright central bump commonly found in galaxies, we exclude the bar region from the radial profile by using a radius of 1.3\\times R_{\\mathrm{Bar}}, where R_\\mathrm{Bar} is adopted from [Herrera-Endoqui, et. al (2015)]() \\citep[see also ][]{mask}. For NGC~4535 and NGC~6744, we adopt bar sizes of 5.1 and 4 kpc, respectively. We determine the radial profiles by averaging the flux in annuli with widths of 500 pc from the center of the galaxy up to a maximum galactocentric distance of <50 kpc. This maximum distance is chosen through visual inspection of different galaxies to exclude any bright nearby sources. Figure \\ref{fig:radial_profile1} presents the radial profiles of {\\it AstroSat} observations in the FUV band for IC~5332 and NGC~1566. The remaining radial profiles are presented in Appendix \\ref{ap1}. In the case of NGC~0253, we use the only available filter in the FUV band: F169M.$\n",
       "$For most of our targets, {\\it AstroSat}'s large (28') field of view (FoV) includes enough sky area at larger galactocentric distances that our simple exponential model (Eq.\\ref{eqn:model}) is sufficient for determining the background level of images robustly. However, some targets have relatively smaller amounts of empty emission-free sky due to the small coverage of observations or several bright sources in the FoV. In these cases, regression over the exponential model fails for a few targets. For example, NGC~0300 is sufficiently nearby that we only have a radial profile out to a small galactocentric distance of R_\\mathrm{gal}<12 kpc. Furthermore, the exponential model is not appropriate for the highly-inclined NGC~0253, where we see many bright gas clumps at R_\\mathrm{gal}<10 kpc. In the cases of NGC~3621 and NGC~5128, we decided not to use the regression to determine the background level due to a number of nearby bright sources. Finally, in the interacting system of NGC~1512-1510, a simple exponential model could not describe the complicated radial profile of this merging system, hence the background value could not be estimated robustly from radial profiles.$\n",
       "$In these cases, we instead used a \\textit{\"mean-level\"} estimate of the backgrounds.  The background value for each of these targets is estimated by taking the mean value of an annulus around each object. The annulus radius is newd by visual inspection, ensuring the exclusion of nearby sources, mostly \\mathrm{R}>3 \\mathrm{R}_{25}. However, these annuli values might still suffer from bright stars or reaching the edge of the FoV. We reject bright sources using Chauvenet's criterion in the annulus data distribution (i.e., iteratively rejecting data >3\\sigma where \\sigma is the standard deviation and then recalculating \\sigma). The standard deviation is inserted into the Chauvenet criterion using the median absolute deviation (MAD) as an estimator. The MAD standard deviation is newd by the \\texttt{astropy.stats} module\\footnote{https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/stats/index.html}. Although the MAD standard deviation is robust to outliers, it could be zero or much smaller than the normal standard deviation due to the faint nature of background emission. In that case, we used ordinary standard deviation to avoid failure of the Chauvenet criterion.  After rejecting data using this criterion, we estimate the background as the mean in the annulus. Regarding the discussion of the new XUV disk galaxy NGC 6744, which has spiral arms extending beyond 2 R_{25} (as detailed in Section \\ref{sec:xuv}), we have decided to avoid using the radial profile or \\textit{\"mean-level\"} background. The radial profile of this galaxy is not exponential and the estimation of the background is not reliable due to the presence of numerous bright stellar clusters and \\ion{H}{2} regions. Therefore, we have carefully chosen a few 1.5\\arcmin  apertures that are free from bright sources, and estimated the mean emission from those locations. The estimated background is 20 and 34 percent higher than \\textit{\"mean-level\"} and radial profile respectively.$\n",

       "$In the following sections, we illustrate the scientific potential of arcsecond resolution and relatively wide field-of-view of the FUV imaging in the context of the PHANGS multiwavelength data set. Unlike the PHANGS observations conducted by ALMA, MUSE, JWST, and HST, which are predominantly confined to the inner disks of galaxies, {\\it AstroSat}'s observations extend significantly beyond the optical disks, offering a more expansive view of the low-density structure of galaxies  ([Leroy, Schinnerer and Hughes 2021](), [Emsellem, Schinnerer and Santoro 2022](), [Lee, Whitmore and Thilker 2022](), [Lee, Sandstrom and Leroy 2022]()) . Here, we use the {\\it AstroSat} data to identify extended ultraviolet (XUV) disks beyond the optical disk of galaxies. [Thilker, Bianchi and Meurer (2007)]() searched for the XUV disk galaxies in the local universe (D<40 Mpc) using GALEX observations, finding UV-bright complexes beyond the optical radius in 30\\% of spiral galaxies  ([Thilker, Bianchi and Meurer 2007]()) . The detection of XUV emission is particularly intriguing as it implies the presence of recent massive star formation. Remarkably, this formation is taking place in poorly understood environments, characterized by low ISM pressure and low metallicity. These unconventional conditions foster extreme scenarios, which offer valuable opportunities to challenge and refine our current theories of star formation. Subsequent observations in the Local Volume and at a distance beyond 100~Mpc have further confirmed the ubiquity of XUV disk galaxies  ([Lemonias, Schiminovich and Thilker 2011]()) . Previous findings also confirm that FUV complexes with masses of 10^{3}-10^{4} \\:{\\rm M_\\odot} are being ionized by single stars  ([Madore and Boissier 2005]()) . On the other hand, UV emission could also originate from white dwarfs in XUV disks  ([Sahu, Subramaniam and Simunovic 2019]()) .$\n",
       "$Different scenarios are proposed for triggering the star formation process in XUV disks, such as interactions, perturbations, and gas accretion  ([Bush, et. al 2008](), [Bush, Cox and Hayward 2010](), [Das, Yadav and Patra 2021]()) . In addition, spiral density waves could propagate from inner to outer disk and result in gravitationally unstable regions which eventually form stars  ([Lemonias, Schiminovich and Thilker 2011]()) . As one possible indication of the formation mechanisms, radio observations also find extended \\ion{H}{1} disks associated with XUV emission in M~83 and NGC~4625  ([Tilanus and Allen 1993](), [Bigiel, Leroy and Seibert 2010](), [Bush and Wilcots 2004]()) .  In the case of the late type galaxy NGC~0628, a faint trail of UV emission extends into the HI outer disk, which resembles a spiral-like structure  ([Das, et. al 2020]()) . The consumption timescale of \\ion{H}{1} in XUV disks is estimated to range from a few Gyr up to the Hubble time  ([Madore and Boissier 2005]()) . Galaxies hosting XUV disks might indicate the presence of molecular clouds as well as extended \\ion{H}{1} well beyond their stellar disks. The detection of faint CO emission in the outer disk is essential to understand the star formation efficiency (SFE) in this environment. For instance, [Dessauges-Zavadsky, et. al (2014)]() detected CO(1-0) in M~63 with a low SFE, compared to inner disk regions using the IRAM 30~m telescope. [Koda, Watson and Combes (2022)]() used deep ALMA observations to identify small molecular clouds associated with the XUV emission. The mechanisms behind the formation of XUV disks in galaxies are still unclear and the number of well-studied targets remains small.  In this study, our objective is to use new UVIT observations to identify new potential candidates using the XUV disk classification scheme proposed by [Thilker, Bianchi and Meurer (2007)]().$\n",

       "$Following the prescriptions of [Thilker, Bianchi and Meurer (2007)]() and [Lemonias, Schiminovich and Thilker (2011)](), we used a foreground-extinction-corrected, background-subtracted UV surface brightness (\\mu_\\mathrm{FUV}=27.25 AB magnitudes arcsec^{-2}) as a threshold level to identify FUV clumps in XUV disks. This UV surface brightness corresponds to \\Sigma_\\mathrm{SFR}= 3\\times10^{-4}~M_{\\odot}~yr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}, which is based on a Salpeter IMF and calibrations from [ and Kennicutt (1998)](). This type of XUV disk requires more than one structured UV complex (e.g. spiral segments) and is known as a Type 1 XUV-disk or \"M~83 like\" object. We do not consider diffuse UV emission as a criterion for XUV disks, as it could be related to other recent SF processes or originated from hot core-helium-burning stars  ([Hoopes, Heckman and Strickland 2005]()) . The companion IB(s)m NGC~6744A galaxy is visible in the northwest region in the FUV band as well. Furthermore, GMOS/IFU observations in the center of this galaxy suggested two periods of star formation which the last one happened one billion years ago, due to a merger event  ([Steiner and Menezes 2018]()) . Having this evidence, we propose that NGC~6744 is a Type 1 XUV-disk and its nature is probably related to the accretion of gas from its companion in a merger event.$\n",
       "$\\textit{IC~5332:} this galaxy is also another intermediate spiral galaxy but with 5\\times lower stellar mass (M=0.41 \\times 10^{10} M_{\\odot}) in comparison with NGC~6744. Although we see several star forming complexes beyond the optical disk, we do not identify any ordered spiral-like features. Unlike NGC~6744, there are several irregular clumpy structures at R>R_{25}1.5. [Thilker, Bianchi and Meurer (2007)]() found that Type 2 XUV disks are more common in late-type/low-mass spirals, similar to IC~5332. Using 2MASS K_{s} data from [Skrutskie, Cutri and Stiening (2006)](), we are unable to newcommandine a low surface brightness (LSB) zone for these irregular structures in the outer disk, as the K_{s}-band luminosity is faint in this region. Parkes and ATCA observations of IC~5332 also confirm the existence of an extended \\ion{H}{1} emission in the outer disk  ([Pisano, Barnes and Staveley-Smith 2011]())  while most of the molecular emission is organized into individual clouds. However, the UV clumping factor has not been examined before. The photospheric emission from young stars, traced by the FUV, should have slightly different clumping structures compared to molecular gas since they are much brighter in the outer disk. Additionally, the FUV emission may originate from a wide range of stellar populations with different ages, so the clumping factor could lie between that of molecular and atomic gas. Here, we explore the clumpiness in CO versus FUV emission to show how the formation of massive stars may derive from the ISM clumpiness. Having 31 galaxies spanning a wide range of mass and metallicity, we can also inspect the clumpiness in different galactic environments. We restrict our analysis to the regions where FUV maps overlap with the ALMA CO observations and carry out the analysis at a common resolution of 175 pc.$\n",

The environment masks include almost all morphological features of galaxies, most importantly, spiral arms, interarm regions, and centers. The masks were constructed using visual inspection of IRAC 3.6~\\mum data and structural decomposition analysis  ([Herrera-Endoqui, et. al 2015](), [Salo, Laurikainen and Laine 2015]()) . We note that the widths of the spiral arms masks are relatively broad (1-2 kpc) and are estimated from the spatial distribution of CO emission.$\n",
       "$We find that the median values of the clumping factor estimated from FUV and CO emission are similar across most environment masks at a spatial resolution of 175 pc. This is illustrated in Fig.~\\ref{fig:clumping_env}, which shows the range of clumping factors seen in different galaxies that share common morphological features.$\n",
       "$However, the center and spiral arms are the only regions that are more clumped in FUV relative to the CO. The median of the FUV clumping factor is 1.51, whereas the clumping factor for CO is 1.35 in the center of galaxies. To analyze the differences between these two distributions further, we applied the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistics. This analysis resulted in a KS value of 0.4 in the center, indicating a modestly significant difference between the distributions with a p-value of 0.04. In contrast, within the spiral arms, the median clumping factor is c=2.7 for the FUV and c=2.5 for CO. However, the KS value in this region is lower than in the center, at 0.21. The associated high p-value of 0.92 shows no evidence for a significant difference between the FUV and CO distributions in the spiral arms. Consequently, this suggests that the distribution of the clumping factor for FUV and CO in the spiral arms is more similar compared to the center.$\n",
       "$The bars of galaxies have on average the largest clumping factor, particularly for the CO emission, with a CO clumping factor distribution reaching up to \\approx 7. This result is not surprising since the most massive giant molecular clouds are located in bars \\citep[e.g.][]{rosolowsky21} but these regions can also be devoid of molecular gas \\citep[][]{Leroy2021}. CO emission in bars has also been shown to have a relatively thin structure  ([Stuber, Schinnerer and Williams 2023]()) .$\n",
       "$Using Table~\\ref{tab:galpropss}, we observed a higher c_\\mathrm{FUV} in the centers of galaxies hosting AGNs. Notably, a similar trend was also seen in a few non-AGN galaxies.$\n",
       "$On the other hand, spiral arms are more clumped in FUV emission, implying UV bright complexes are more concentrated and molecular clouds more uniformly spread along spiral arms. The clumping factor could also be exaggerated by high attenuation in the FUV band, broadening the distribution of light.$\n",
       "$Our results suggest that in general, clumps of molecular gas are more concentrated in galaxies, whereas FUV emission is more spread out at 175~pc resolution.$\n",
       "$Figure \\ref{fig:clumping_env} also shows the distribution of the measured clumping factor using 1~kpc size hexagonal apertures, labeled as \"all\". Similar to the galaxy-integrated values, the median CO clumping factor is still higher (c=1.7 \\pm 0.1) than the FUV values (c=1.3 \\pm 0.1). Our results are in good agreement with [Sun, Leroy and Rosolowsky (2022)]() included in their sample, which usually have very high clumping factors.  In contrast, the PHANGS-ALMA sample typically studies more distant, higher mass systems (i.e., more metal rich and bright in CO).$\n",
       "$\\subsection{Gini coefficient}$\n",
       "$We also use the Gini coefficient (G) as a non-parametric  measure of the distribution of a quantity  ([ and Gini 1912]()) . It has been adapted for quantitative morphological studies of galaxies at different wavelengths, including GALEX observations \\cite[e.g.][]{gini_class}. It measures the inequality in a distribution and the higher values indicate a concentration of medium brightness in a small region. The non-normalized values of the clumping factor might raise a concern where two different galactic environments exhibit similar values but not the same morphology. Hence, the Gini coefficient is considered here to assist us in distinguishing between the smoothness of different environments. Following [Davis, Gensior and Bureau (2022)](), we newcommandine the parameter as:$\n",
       "$\\begin{equation}$\n",
       "$G_{\\theta \\mathrm{pc}} = \\frac{1}{\\bar{I}  n (n-1)} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i-n-1)I_{i},$\n",

       "$\\end{equation}$\n",
       "$where n is a number of pixels, I_{i} surface brightness of each pixel sorted in ascending brightness order, and \\bar{I} is the mean brightness measured over all the pixels. The summation (i) is over all pixels of the area. The Gini coefficient, with values between 0 and 1, measures the concentration of clumps in an area. A higher G value indicates a greater concentration of clumps. The accuracy of the G measurement can be influenced by factors such as aperture size and the signal-to-noise ratio of the data. If there are many faint pixels in the region, the results may be impacted  ([ and Lisker 2008]()) . We present the distribution of the Gini coefficient in Fig.~\\ref{fig:clumping_env}. The median of the Gini coefficient measured in 1 kpc hexagonal apertures shows that our measurements of G_{\\rm CO}=0.43 are higher than G_{\\rm FUV}=0.3. This aligns with clumping factor measurements, indicating that UV emission is smoother at a kpc resolution.$\n",
       "$The Gini coefficient presents a complementary picture of smoothness of the ISM in galaxies compared to the clumping factor. As illustrated in Fig.~\\ref{fig:clumping_env}, the smoothness of both the CO and FUV emission decreases in parallel from the inside to the outer parts of galaxies. The centers exhibit a smoother distribution than spiral arms and disks. We note that the high clumpiness measured by Gini in disks are due to the high level of noise in ALMA data at 175~pc.  In spiral arms, there is no clear correlation between G and c, with G suggesting a more clumpy distribution. This discrepancy may be due to the sensitivity of G to the effect of faint diffuse emission in spiral arms or the limited sample size (only 14 galaxies with spiral arms masks at this resolution). However, both measures find that the clumping of the CO and FUV emission is similar with the CO being typically slightly more clustered than the FUV.  Such a trend could be expected given the typical \"cycling\" time of the molecular ISM \\citep[<30~Myr][]{Blitz80,chevance22} is less than the FUV emission that would be produced from the stars formed from the molecular clouds (100~Myr).  Such clumping should be readily measured in simulations.$\n",

       "$\\label{sec:fuvha}$\n",
       "$In this section, we compare the FUV to the H\\alpha emission in the resolved structure of galaxies. FUV and H\\alpha are tracers of star formation on different timescales. The UV continuum arises primarily from the photosphere of O and B stars (\\mathrm{M}>3~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}), sensitive to star formation over a 100~Myr time scale  ([Kennicutt and Evans 2012]()) . In contrast, the H\\alpha emission line originates from the recombination of gas that is ionized in \\ion{H}{2} regions by massive stars (Extreme UV emission), which are typically O and only early-type B stars with masses of M>17~M_{\\odot}   ([Lee and Tremonti 2009](), [Lee and Kennicutt 2011]()) . The H\\alpha emission line traces recent star formation with a timescale of about 5  Myr  ([Kennicutt and Evans 2012]()) .  Hence, the H\\alpha emission is the optical proxy for photons with E_\\gamma > 13.6~\\mathrm{eV} but the {\\it AstroSat} FUV data trace photons with 6 < E_\\gamma/\\mathrm{eV} < 9.$\n",
       "$Both tracers also suffer the effects of dust attenuation, but the attenuation toward the shorter wavelengths (FUV) is higher. Many studies \\cite[e.g][]{Calzetti94,Kreckel_2013} have observed that nebular emission from dust-enveloped \\ion{H}{2} regions undergo roughly double the reddening of the stellar continuum. As a result, H\\alpha attenuation is more comparable to the UV continuum, once differential reddening between gas and stars is factored in  ([Lee and Tremonti 2009]()) .$\n",
       "$Utilizing the improved resolution from the {\\it AstroSat} FUV observations, our goal is to compare these observations with PHANGS-MUSE H\\alpha data  ([Emsellem, Schinnerer and Santoro 2022]()) . With 15 targets common to both data sets, we can probe the variation in the FUV-to-H\\alpha ratio across distinct galactic environments at 175 pc and 1 kpc resolution. This ratio is influenced by a multitude of factors such as dust attenuation, the age and mass of the stellar populations, star formation history, Initial Mass Function (IMF), and metallicity  ([Lee and Tremonti 2009]()) .$\n",

As highlighted by [Whitmore, Chandar and Rodríguez (2023)](), this central ring contains several bright, young star-forming regions, which are notably luminous in narrow-band H\\alpha HST maps (private communication with Ashley Barnes). This leads to an increased H\\alpha emission in the center, with approximately 70 percent of this emission stemming from star-forming regions rather than the AGN. Therefore, the low FUV/H\\alpha ratio observed in this region cannot be attributed exclusively to the AGN's influence. Further investigation of the inner 5\\arcsec (= 475~pc) of the NGC 1365 central source reveals a smooth non-star-forming disk, reminiscent of early-type galaxies. This region remains stable against gravitational collapse  ([Schinnerer, Emsellem and Henshaw 2023]()) . Other galaxies hosting AGNs, such as NGC 1566, NGC 3627, and NGC 7496, exhibit a log FUV/H\\alpha ratio exceeding 1.4 in their centers.$\n",
       "$We note that the measurement of H\\alpha in the center of AGNs can be challenging, as its spectra show broad features and multiple components that are not fitted by the single Gaussian fitting approach used by [Emsellem, Schinnerer and Santoro (2022)]().$\n",

The median profile across all 15 targets is nearly flat with a typical value of \\log(\\mathrm{FUV/H}\\alpha)=1.9, which is consistent with the analysis we new in Section \\ref{ssec:env}. Most of our targets have a flat radial profile, with a few spikes or dips. Most notably, the galaxies IC5332 (log FUV/H\\alpha \\sim 2.1) and NGC3627 (log FUV/H\\alpha \\sim 1.65), show a significant variation.$\n",
       "$The low-mass spiral galaxy IC5332, which is a candidate for XUV type 2 as discussed in Section \\ref{sec:xuv}, shows a higher log FUV/H\\alpha ratio. The majority of its \\ion{H}{2} regions have a ratio between 1.6 and 1.9, with a few regions exhibiting higher ratios (>2) in spiral arm ends, indicating the presence of older populations. The higher ratio of log (FUV/H\\alpha) is linked to the low dust content of IC5332, where most of its \\ion{H}{2} regions display minimal reddening, E(B-V)=0.05-0.1.$\n",
       "$Conversely, NGC3627, which extends up to 3 R_{\\text{Gal}}/R_{\\text{eff}}, demonstrates several dips in its radial profile, corresponding to various \\ion{H}{2} regions combined with a few Milky Way stars in its spiral arm.

The galaxy hosts a massive star-forming region located at the end of the bar, which shows a higher reddening (E(B-V)>1) and molecular gas (I_{\\text{CO}}>200~K~km~s^{-1}). In the central region, we observe a ratio of 0.7, which, once again, is associated with high reddening and a substantial amount of molecular gas.

       "$\\subsection{Physical parameters affecting log FUV/H\\alpha}$\n",
       "$Given the relatively high physical resolution of the PHANGS-{\\it AstroSat} data set and the richness of the supporting data, we have a new opportunity to understand what physical factors are driving changes in the log FUV/H\\alpha ratios on 175~pc scales. These effects have been explored in previous works based on the integrated properties of galaxies or at coarser resolution  ([Lee and Tremonti 2009](), [Meurer, Wong and Kim 2009]()) . While \\log (\\mathrm{FUV/H}\\alpha) could new good insight into galactic evolution through, e.g., tracing the star formation history  ([Lomaeva, Saintonge and Decleir 2022]()) , the effects of dust attenuation and reddening will alter this ratio, which requires carefully understanding the effects of dust.  There are a myriad of possible factors shaping the FUV/H\\alpha, so we assess whether these effects are detectable in our sample.  In addition to those explored below, previous works have proposed several possible physical factors that change FUV/H\\alpha including the porosity of the interstellar medium (ISM), stochastic effects from the number of massive stars, and variations in the Initial Mass Function. Below, we focus our work on factors where we have good observational proxies.$\n",
       "$\\paragraph{Metallicity} Stellar populations with lower metallicity have hotter atmospheres, resulting in the production of more UV photons, particularly ionizing ones  ([Lee and Tremonti 2009]()) . Conversely, metal-rich populations, such as those concentrated in galaxy centers, tend to be cooler and more evolved, emitting a reduced amount of ionizing flux compared to non-ionizing UV continuum. Theoretical demonstrations by [Lee and Tremonti (2009)](), showed that the effect of metallicity primarily influences H\\alpha emission rather than FUV emission due to assumptions regarding case B recombination and the spatial treatment with ionizing photons. However, to observe this effect, one requires a significant variation in metallicity, so we expect this effect to be weak across our sample.$\n",
       "$\\paragraph{The Equivalent Width (EW) of H\\alpha} The EW of H\\alpha is also used to trace the age of young stellar populations, particularly in areas where the H\\alpha emission is bright enough  ([Scheuermann, Kreckel and Barnes 2023]()) . The EW of H\\alpha serves as an indicator of the relative brightness of the nebular emission compared to the underlying stellar continuum. Younger stars, with ages on the order of millions of years, exhibit high EW values for H\\alpha as they are actively ionizing the surrounding gas, producing intense nebular emission. Observations in both the local universe and at higher redshifts confirm changes in the EW of H\\alpha with the age of \\ion{H}{2} regions \\citep[e.g.,][]{ew,ew_z}. On the other hand, evolutionary synthesis models predicted its functional form  ([Zurita and Pérez 2008]()) . The EW of H\\alpha is a highly observable signature of the balance between very young and older stars. At the scale of \\ion{H}{2} regions, we expect to observe an anti-correlation between the EW of H\\alpha and \\log (\\mathrm{FUV/H}\\alpha), where bright H\\alpha is associated with ages below 10 Myrs. For older stellar populations, where the EW of H\\alpha is below 10 Å, the relation is not notable.$\n",
       "$\\paragraph{Star Formation History} Sharp fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR) could also result in changes in the log FUV/H\\alpha ratio, given the varying lifetimes of O and B stars. Consequently, this ratio may be used to trace variations in the star formation rate on different timescales, ranging from 5 to 200~Myr  ([Kennicutt and Evans 2012]()) . This is often referred to as the \"burstiness\" of star formation. On the other hand, a temporary decrease or \"gasp\" in the star formation rate should also be considered in this context  ([Meurer, Wong and Kim 2009]()) . [Mehta, Teplitz and Scarlata (2023)]() investigated the time-evolution of the dust-corrected log FUV/H\\alpha and found under conditions of steady, constant star formation, an equilibrium state is achieved with a log FUV/H\\alpha \\sim 2. This highlights how SFH parameters such stellar mass, age, and metallicity might impact the FUV/H\\alpha ratio in galaxies.$\n",

Initially, we introduce a comprehensive model encompassing the majority of observed and physical quantities to describe the log ratio as outlined in Section \\ref{subsubsection:lasso}.

       "$\\label{subsubsection:lasso}$\n",
       "$In this section, we present a comprehensive model to quantify the role of different variables in predicting the log of the FUV/H\\alpha ratio. Previous studies have demonstrated how various physical parameters of galaxies, specifically resolved structural parameters, can be modeled using multivariate linear regression in logarithmic space \\cite[e.g.,][]{day,Ssun_2022}.$\n",
       "$We aim to predict log FUV/H\\alpha using variables such as E(B-V), I_\\mathrm{CO}, H\\alpha EW, stellar age, mass, and metallicity using the panchromatic PHANGS data. Leveraging the PHANGS MUSE observations, we employ maps of stellar mass, light-weighted age, and light-weighed stellar metallicity for our targets. The specific models used in that fit set the range of expectations for our results, which we summarize here.  Specifically, they employ a \\textit{young} fitting template over observed lines and continuum described in [Emsellem, Schinnerer and Santoro (2022)](). In that study, the E-MILES stellar population models from [Vazdekis, et. al (2016)]() and [Vazdekis and Cerviño (2017)]() are expanded to include younger age groups. This is particularly important as we are making a direct comparison of the ratio of young stellar populations traced by H\\alpha at <5~Myr, to intermediate ages traced by FUV emission. The selected templates incorporate the Padova isochrones and include 18 bins for ages ranging from 6.3 Myr to 14.12~Gyr. Here, we note that most of the ages measured from PHANGS-MUSE using the \\textit{young} template are older than 10 Myrs, which does not align with the typical age of 5 Myrs for H\\alpha bright \\ion{H}{2} regions as highlighted by [Kennicutt and Evans (2012)](), [Hassani, Rosolowsky and Leroy (2022)](). Therefore, to more accurately trace the ages of these younger regions, we have incorporated the EW of H\\alpha emission as a weighting factor in the LASSO analysis. Additionally, the stellar metallicity is binned from -0.7 to 0.22 for older stellar populations (age >63~Myr), while for younger populations, the [Z/H] bins range from -0.7 to 0.41. Bright stars are masked in our results to avoid potential distortions.  For our 175-pc resolution, we also include an environmental classification, which can assume values of 0 or 1. These environments are categorized as center, bar, spiral, interarm, and disk. We perform the same analysis for the 1-kpc scale but exclude the environmental classifications since the different environments are not well resolved at this resolution.$\n",
       "$We note two important cautions here. Firstly, we assume a linear relationship in log space between each predictor and the outcome variable, although we acknowledge that may not be the case. The combination of dust reddening with stellar mass, age, and metallicity, may not exhibit a linear relation with the log FUV/H\\alpha, especially at a 1~kpc scale. The interplay and degeneracy between dust, metallicity, and age of stars has been addressed in previous studies  ([Lee and Tremonti 2009]()) . Moreover, due to this degeneracy, we anticipate colinearity between parameters, particularly between E(B-V) and CO intensity, or age and metallicity. This co-linearity will impact our results, as the coefficients of these parameters in the model will be influenced by each other.$\n",
       "$Figure \\ref{fig:corr} highlights the correlation between different predictors. We observe a correlation between stellar metallicity and age, with a Spearman coefficient of approximately 0.6, indicating an older population with higher metal content. We also find a strong anti-correlation between the EW of H\\alpha and the age of the stellar population. A similar anti-correlation is also observed between the EW of H\\alpha emission and stellar metallicity. It is important to note that different environments do not exhibit any significant correlation with physical or observed parameters. However, we do observe a weak trend between the presence of a bar and the surface density of stellar mass, which can be attributed to the concentration of stellar gas in the bar of most galaxies  ([Stuber, Schinnerer and Williams 2023]()) .$\n",
       "$We use the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression \\citep[LASSO;][]{lasso_paper} to understand how each predictor control the variation of the log ratio. Following [Dey, Rosolowsky and Cao (2019)](), we use 5-fold cross-validation (CV) to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model, ensuring that the performance is evaluated on different subsets of the data. LASSO is a regularization method that helps prevent overfitting in linear regression models by introducing a penalty to the absolute sizes of the coefficients. This not only helps in model simplification but also in feature selection, as some coefficients can be shrunk to zero, effectively excluding that predictor from the model. The degree of regularization is controlled by the parameter \\alpha. By adjusting the \\alpha value through cross-validation, we make sure it news the best fit between our training and validation data.$\n",

The intercept term (\\alpha_0) represents the expected log FUV/H\\alpha when all predictors are equal to their medians, which is \\approx2.0 at both resolutions. The slope coefficients indicate the change in the log FUV/H\\alpha while holding all other predictors constant. At 175~pc resolution, more localized effects and variations within resolved structures of galaxies may introduce additional complexities, which could account for the observed differences. In general, we observe negative exponents for all predictors, except for metallicity. A higher coefficient for dust reddening is observed at both resolutions, indicating the importance of attenuation in the log ratio.  We also note that the slopes for the different environment predictors are all weak, suggesting that variation in the log ratio that we observe can be explained better by variations in other parameters in the model.  Similarly, the scaling for metallicity (Z/H) is also weak, though the range of metallcities probed is relatively small.$\n",
       "$Additionally, the H\\alpha EW also exhibits a negative slope, suggesting that younger sources with prominent H\\alpha EW values may result in a lower log FUV/H\\alpha ratio. However, it is important to note that the relationship between the age of the stellar population and the H\\alpha EW is not linear  ([Cedrés, Cepa and Tomita 2005]()) . We note the intrinsic correlation between the line brightness and its EW, which is tight in star-forming regions.$\n",
       "$Furthermore, we observe a negative slope in the relationship between age and the FUV/H\\alpha ratio, which is surprising. On the scale of \\ion{H}{2} regions or stellar clusters (i.e., <50~pc), we expect that a higher FUV/H\\alpha ratio would correspond to an older population (i.e., >100~Myr) where the H\\alpha emission is faint  ([Ujjwal, Kartha and Subramanian 2022]()) . However, at a resolution of 175~pc, which is the best common resolution available, there might not be a clear relation due to the mixing of diffuse H\\alpha emission with \\ion{H}{2} regions. Taking into account the degeneracy between age, metallicity, and dust attenuation, we propose that this negative slope may result from non-linear relations between other parameters correlated with the stellar age.$\n",

To delve deeper and find a simplified model to describe the log ratio, we run a model that includes only dust reddening, E(B-V). This resulted in dust reddening coefficients of approximately -1.7 at 175 pc scale. The goodness of fit, represented by R^{2}, yielded values of 0.5. This indicates that dust reddening alone can account for roughly half of the variation in the log ratio. Notably, a standalone model of CO can predict the log ratio as effectively as a single reddening component, with an R^{2} of 0.4. However, the coefficient of the CO component is -0.4. Figure \\ref{fig:fuv_ha_ratio_dust} illustrates that a lower \\log(\\mathrm{FUV/H}\\alpha) ratio (indicating higher attenuation) corresponds to higher CO intensity, particularly in regions containing dense, dusty, and massive star-forming regions. This trend holds not only on the 1~kpc scale, as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:fuv_ha_ratio_dust}, but also at the 175~pc resolution. This suggests that dust and molecular emission are tracing each other.  This supposition is borne out through measuring a significant correlation between CO emission and E(B-V) on a kpc scale, supported by a Spearman rank coefficient of \\rho \\approx 0.75. This correlation remains robust even when we enhance the resolution to 175 pc, although it exhibits notable variations across diverse environments.$\n",

We use a prescription following [Boquien, Buat and Boselli (2012)]() to estimate A_{FUV} using our measured \\beta values, thereby correcting the FUV emission.  We also use the Balmer decrement measurements and E(B-V) presented previously to correct the H\\alpha emission, based on a typical value of the total-to-selective value R_{V}=3.1  ([Calzetti, Armus and Bohlin 2000](), [Belfiore, Leroy and Sun 2022]()) . After correcting both FUV and H\\alpha, we measure the log ratio using 1 kpc hexagonal apertures and measure how well the variation of  ratio is predicted by the luminosity-weighted  age,  surface mass density, and metallicity of the stellar population. We found that this model can describe the variation of the dust-attenuation corrected log ratio with an R^{2} = 0.49. Our results show coefficients of 0.84 for age, -1.39 for the stellar mass surface density, and 0.33 for the stellar metallicity, along with an intercept of \\alpha_0 = 2.98 (c.f.

The models of [Mehta, Teplitz and Scarlata (2023)]() show that the log of the FUV/Ha ratio will reach an equilibrium state 100-200 million years after the onset of a constant star formation history (see also the model predictions from [Weisz, Johnson and Johnson (2012)]() for log M_{\\star}\\sim10 galaxies).

       "$We present the {\\it AstroSat} UVIT observations of 31 massive spiral nearby galaxies spanning over an order of magnitude in stellar mass. These galaxies are part of the PHANGS Survey of nearby galaxies which is synthesizing a broad range of multiwavelength data, including the ALMA and VLT/MUSE data that support this work.  UVIT data improves over previous UV observations with \\sim 1.4\" resolution enabling studies of young stellar populations and dust attenuation on  <200~pc scales. This atlas contains data available from dedicated observations collected as part of PHANGS as well as a uniform reduction of the available data from the AstroSat archive.  Hence, the atlas contains data from galaxies in one to nine UV bands covering wavelengths from 1480~Å  to 2790~Å. These data can new new resolved observational constraints to challenging questions such as attenuation curve, dust attenuation, and UV SFR for 30\\% of the full PHANGS sample. The PHANGS-AstroSAT atlas is available online\\footnote{\\url{https://www.canfar.net/storage/vault/list/phangs/RELEASES/PHANGS-AstroSat/v1p0}}. This paper describes:$\n",
       "$\\begin{enumerate}$\n",
       "$  \\item \\textit{Observations and quality assessment:}  The PHANGS-{\\it AstroSat} atlas targets low-inclination (i<75^\\circ) massive (M_\\star>10^{9.57}~M_\\odot, actively star-forming galaxies in the local universe (D<22 Mpc). As described in Section \\ref{sec:data}, we observe 11 galaxies for \\sim 3 ks each in the F148W band.  For these and 20 other targets available in the archive, we apply the standard UVIT data calibration processes in \\textsc{CCDLAB} \\citep[Section \\ref{sec:procs};][]{postma17}. We found that the pipeline reduction yields a typical resolution of 1.4\\arcsec at the FUV and 1.2\\arcsec at the NUV band. We new science-ready maps of our targets after background subtraction and foreground extinction corrections.  The UV background emission is \\sim10^{-19}~erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}  Å^{-1} for most of our targets at \\lambda =1480 Å. We assess the quality of our data by comparing \\textit{AstroSat} UVIT observations with GALEX maps from [Leroy, Sandstrom and Lang (2019)](). The comparison of our data set with GALEX observations shows good flux scale agreement (<10\\% variations), as illustrated in Figs.~ \\ref{fig:fuv_galex},~\\ref{fig:nuv_galex}.$\n",
       "$  \\item \\textit{XUV disks}: In Section \\ref{sec:xuv} we present NGC 6744 as a new Type 1 XUV disk candidate and IC~5332 as a  candidate for a Type 2 XUV disk galaxy.  NGC~6744 shows a very large scale length in FUV and we identify two bright spiral arms beyond 1.5 R_{25}, without any R-band or H\\alpha emission.  We did not find convincing evidence other candidates that were previously unknown though we confirm all previous classifications  ([Thilker, Bianchi and Meurer 2007]()) .$\n",
       "$  \\item \\textit{Structure of CO and FUV emission}: In Section \\ref{sec:clumping}, we quantify the clumping and smoothness of the FUV and CO emission using two non-parametric scalar measurements: the clumping factor (c) and the Gini coefficient (G).  Using more than 4000 1-kpc hexagonal apertures in our targets, we find c_\\mathrm{CO}=1.7 versus a median of c_\\mathrm{FUV}=1.3 , illustrating the FUV emission is less clumped than the CO.  In general, we find that bars are the most clumped environments. Although the median clumping factor from FUV and CO emission is similar across different environments, CO clumping factors are slightly higher than FUV except in the center and spiral arms. Furthermore, clumps of UV bright emission, which could have \\ion{H}{2} region counterparts, have the most effect on increasing the clumping factor. The non-parametric Gini coefficient also predicts a smoother distribution for FUV emission compared to CO except in the center, which is in agreement with clumping factor results.$\n",
       "$  \\item \\textit{FUV to H\\alpha ratio}: In pairing UVIT and MUSE H\\alpha maps, we used 1 kpc size apertures and see a \\sim2~dex difference in non-dust-corrected FUV and H\\alpha luminosity (Section \\ref{sec:fuvha}). We find \\log_{10}(\\mathrm{FUV/H}\\alpha)<2 the centers and bars. The log ratio at the center of AGN galaxies is 65 percent lower than that in normal star-forming galaxies. The radial profile of \\log_{10}(\\mathrm{FUV/H}\\alpha) is approximately flat outside centers, and shows small variation from 1.7 to 2.1.  We propose an empirical model to predict the observed log ratio in our sample.  The model considers how several parameters predict FUV/H\\alpha including CO molecular gas emission,  E(B-V), star formation history parameters (mass, age, metallicity), and the equivalent width of H\\alpha.  A full model is able to explain the variation of \\log_{10}(\\mathrm{FUV/H}\\alpha) at resolutions of 175~pc and 1~kpc, achieving approximately R^{2}\\sim0.65. In evaluating different versions of the model, we argue that dust attenuation is the dominant factor controlling the variation of the log ratio in star forming disk galaxies. Finally, having corrected both FUV and H\\alpha emissions for internal dust attenuation, we find that when the influences of stellar mass and metallicity are excluded from the FUV/H\\alpha log ratio, a positive correlation emerges between this ratio and the age of the stellar population.$\n",

       "**Abstract:** We present the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS)- $_ AstroSat_$ atlas, which contains ultraviolet imaging of 31 nearby star-forming galaxies captured by the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on the _AstroSat_ satellite. The atlas provides a homogeneous data set of far- and near-ultraviolet maps of galaxies within a distance of 22 Mpc and a median angular resolution of 1.4 arcseconds (corresponding to a physical scale between 25 and 160 pc). After subtracting a uniform ultraviolet background and accounting for Milky Way extinction, we compare our estimated flux densities to GALEX observations, finding good agreement. We find candidate extended UV disks around the galaxies NGC 6744 and IC 5332. We present the first statistical measurements of the clumping of the UV emission and compare it to the clumping of molecular gas traced with ALMA. We find that bars and spiral arms exhibit the highest degree of clumping, and the molecular gas is even more clumped than the FUV emission in galaxies. We investigate the variation of the ratio of observed FUV to H $\\alpha$ in different galactic environments and kpc-sized apertures. We report that $\\sim 65$ \\% varation of the $\\log_{10}$ (FUV/H $\\alpha$ ) can be described through a combination of dust attenuation with star formation history parameters. The PHANGS- $_ AstroSat_$ atlas enhances the multi-wavelength coverage of our sample, offering a detailed perspective on star formation. When integrated with PHANGS data sets  from ALMA, VLT-MUSE, HST and JWST, it develops our comprehensive understanding of attenuation curves and dust attenuation in star-forming galaxies.\n",
