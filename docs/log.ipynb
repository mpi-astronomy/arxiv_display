       "|**Abstract**| We study the evolutionary path of the Fornax cluster galaxy NGC$~$1436, which is known to be currently transitioning from a spiral into a lenticular morphology. This galaxy hosts an inner star-forming disc and an outer quiescent disc, and we analyse data from the MeerKAT Fornax Survey, ALMA, and the Fornax3D survey to study the interstellar medium and the stellar populations of both disc components. Thanks to the combination of high resolution and sensitivity of the MeerKAT data, we find that the $\\textrm{H}\\scriptstyle\\mathrm{I}$ is entirely confined within the inner star-forming disc, and that its kinematics is coincident with that of the CO. The cold gas disc is now well settled, which suggests that the galaxy has not been affected by any environmental interactions in the last $\\sim1~$Gyr. The star formation history derived from the Fornax3D data shows that both the inner and outer disc experienced a burst of star formation $\\sim5$ Gyr ago, followed by rapid quenching in the outer disc and by slow quenching in the inner disc, which continues forming stars to this day. We claim that NGC$~$1436 has begun to effectively interact with the cluster environment 5$~$Gyr ago, when a combination of gravitational and hydrodynamical interactions caused the temporary enhancement of the star-formation rate. Furthermore, due to the weaker gravitational binding $\\textrm{H}\\scriptstyle\\mathrm{I}$ was stripped from the outer disc, causing its rapid quenching. At the same time, accretion of gas onto the inner disc stopped, causing slow quenching in this region. |"

       "|**Abstract**| Photoevaporative disc winds play a key role in our understanding of circumstellar disc evolution, especially in the final stages, and they might affect the planet formation process and the final location of planets. The study of transition discs (i.e. discs with a central dust cavity) is central for our understanding of the photoevaporation process and disc dispersal. However, we need to distinguish cavities created by photoevaporation from those created by giant planets. Theoretical models are necessary to identify possible observational signatures of the two different processes, and models to find the differences between the two processes are still lacking. In this paper we study a sample of transition discs obtained from radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of internally photoevaporated discs, and focus on the dust dynamics relevant for current ALMA observations. We then compared our results with gaps opened by super Earths/giant planets, finding that the photoevaporated cavity steepness depends mildly on gap size, and it is similar to that of a 1 Jupiter mass planet. However, the dust density drops less rapidly inside the photoevaporated cavity compared to the planetary case due to the less efficient dust filtering. This effect is visible in the resulting spectral index, which shows a larger spectral index at the cavity edge and a shallower increase inside it with respect to the planetary case. The combination of cavity steepness and spectral index might reveal the true nature of transition discs. |"

This galaxy hosts an inner star-forming disc and an outer quiescent disc, and we analyse data from the MeerKAT Fornax Survey, ALMA, and the Fornax~3D survey to study the interstellar medium and the stellar populations of both disc components.$\n",

The cold gas disc is now well settled, which suggests that the galaxy has not been affected by any environmental interactions in the last \\sim1~Gyr.$\n",
       "$The star formation history derived from the Fornax~3D data shows that both the inner and outer disc experienced a burst of star formation \\sim5 Gyr ago, followed by rapid quenching in the outer disc and by slow quenching in the inner disc, which continues forming stars to this day. We claim that NGC~1436 has begun to effectively interact with the cluster environment 5~Gyr ago, when a combination of gravitational and hydrodynamical interactions caused the temporary enhancement of the star-formation rate. Furthermore, due to the weaker gravitational binding \\hi  was stripped from the outer disc, causing its rapid quenching. At the same time, accretion of gas onto the inner disc stopped, causing slow quenching in this region.$\n",

Therefore, whereas the outskirts of galaxies, which are experiencing cold gas removal, are quenched quickly if no further cold gas is supplied, star formation can continue in the inner - and still \\hi  rich - part of these systems. The outside-in transformation of galaxies which live in dense environments is opposite to what happens to field and void galaxies, where accretion of gas from the intergalactic medium generally keeps fuelling star-formation in the outer disc (e.g. \\citealp{2000MNRAS.312..497B,boselligavazzi,bosellifateofspirals2006ApJ...651..811B}).$\n",
       "$Through the study of the distribution and kinematics of the cold gas, one can gain information on which kind of interactions a galaxy might have experienced after its starvation has begun (if at all).

On the other hand, the footprint of tidal interactions in the cold gas distribution and possibly in the stellar disc is more symmetric as one can see in some two tailed objects in \\cite{1966apg..book.....A}, whose evolutionary scenarios are discussed and modelled by \\cite{2012MNRAS.422.2444S}. Indeed, these interactions can cause two long streams of material in opposite directions (although they can have very different sizes).$\n",

Although in the literature there are several newcommandinitions of quenching timescale (see \\citealp{Lucareview_2021PASA...38...35C} for a discussion), starvation implies longer time scales for a galaxy to halt its star formation (roughly 4~Gyr; \\citealp{2014A&A...564A..66B}) with respect to the shorter time scales due to active gas removal (of the order of a few hundreds of Myr).$\n",

Between these two approaches, we obtained better results modelling NGC~1436 with a flat disc. We further improve the output flat disc model by using an advanced feature of TiRiFiC, which allows us to fit and interpolate some model parameters in groups of model rings rather than for each ring independently.

The presence of such young stars is at odds with the notable absence of any star-formation activity and it is certainly a bias in the template mix adjustment process, which in turn may stem from intrinsic limitations in our ability to constrain the presence of young stellar populations using the MUSE spectra, as indeed these do not extend down to important features (e.g. the D4000 break and H\\delta).$\n",
       "$For this reason we decided to repeat our analysis while also removing all SSP templates younger than 1~Gyr and include this second set of fits in the overall averaging and variance estimation process for the normalised SFHs. We highlight that the actual choice of polynomial order is also quite arbitrary, as the quality of the fit does not change significantly while varying the polynomial order between 6 and 15. Treating this as an additional source of uncertainty we thus repeat our fits varying the polynomial order within the above limits, including the corresponding results in the derivation of the final normalised SFH and associated uncertainties for the inner and outer disc.$\n",
       "$\\placeTNGbothsamecap$\n",
       "$Fig.~\\ref{fig:SFHs_allexp} shows the final normalised SFH in the outer quiescent disc (left) and inner star-forming disc (right) obtained combining the normalised SFHs from their corresponding apertures, considering 20 different fits (10 polynomial orders, and including or excluding SSP templates younger than 1 Gyr).$\n",
       "$The clearer trends of Fig.~\\ref{fig:SFHs_allexp} confirm the picture drawn from our simpler analysis shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:SFHs_oneexp}, according to which NGC~1436 experienced a burst of star formation between 3 to 4 Gyr ago that saw the birth of \\sim50\\% and \\sim20\\% of all the stars that ever formed in the inner and outer disc, respectively.$\n",
       "$Such an activity faded considerably in the past 3 Gyr, and most dramatically in the outer disc where the absence of any present star-formation activity (from the H\\alpha data) is consistent with the lack of star formation between 1 and 2 Gyr in our reconstructed SFH.$\n",
       "$Clearly, our ability to assess the rate of recent decline in star formation in NGC~1436 is limited by the aforementioned biases in recovering the SFH in the last 1 Gyr.$\n",
       "$As a sanity check, in the inner disc we can at least new an estimate for the fractional stellar mass formed in the last Gyr assuming that stars formed at their present-day level over this period of time.$\n",
       "$Using the MUSE H\\alpha maps of \\citet{IodiceF3D} and restricting our analysis to emission-line regions firmly classified as {\\sc H ii} regions we obtained the total star-formation rate in the regions subtended by our inner-disc sectors, using the  \\cite{2012ApJ...752...98C} conversion SFR(M_\\odot/yr)~=~5.5\\times10^{-42}~L_{\\mathrm{H}\\alpha}~\\rm(erg/s) and taking a distance of 20 Mpc.$\n",
       "$The estimate derived in this way (blue cross in Fig.~\\ref{fig:SFHs_allexp}) is consistent with the upper edge for the fractional stellar mass formed in the last 1 Gyr. Similarly, from the H\\alpha map of the outer disc, we measure a 3\\sigma SFR upper limit (red downward arrow) using the 8 sectors of the outer disc.$\n",
       "$Finally, the reconstructed SFH of NGC~1436 shows that before the onset of its recent starburst, some 4 to 5 Gyrs ago, this disc galaxy was evolving according to the cosmological picture with its star-formation activity having already peaked at a redshift between 1 and 2, or some 8 to 10 Gyrs ago \\citep{2018A&A...615A..27L}. In fact, the steeper decline in star-formation activity in the inner regions at these earlier times, is consistent with the commonly observed inside-out evolution of disc galaxies \\citep[e.g.,][]{Kepner99,Nelson16, Johnston22}.$\n",
       "$In summary, our SFH analysis indicates that both the inner and outer disc populations went through three main star-formation phases: \\emph{(i)} a rather typical build up activity and a steady decline in star-formation activity until some 5~Gyr ago, \\emph{(ii)} a burst of star formation peaking between 3 and 4 Gyr ago, and \\emph{(iii)} a final drop in star-formation until present times, gradually reducing it by two orders of magnitude in the inner disc and completely quenching star formation in the outer disc.$\n",
       "$\\section{Discussion}\\label{sec:n1436discussion}$\n",
       "$Several properties of the multi-phase gas disc indicate that NGC 1436 has not experienced any significant tidal or hydrodynamical interaction in recent times: (\\emph{i}) the highly symmetric morphology and settled kinematics of the \\hi  disc observed with MeerKAT at a resolution of \\sim 10\\arcsec \\sim 1~kpc; (\\emph{ii}) the absence of \\hi  disturbances, asymmetries or tails down to a column density of \\sim10^{18} cm^{-2}  (resolution \\sim 60\\arcsec\\sim 6~kpc); \\emph{(iii)} the perfect match between the regular morphology and kinematics of the various gas phases (atomic, molecular and ionised). The fact that the disc is settled now, does not imply that NGC~1436 has never experienced environmental interactions in the past. For example, in the Virgo cluster, some of the most gas-poor galaxies which went through ram-pressure stripping are symmetric systems with a severely truncated \\hi  disc \\citep{2017ApJ...838...81Y}.$\n",
       "$That is, after a few orbital periods any sign of interactions would disappear. Given the orbital time of NGC~1436 (300 Myr at the edge of the \\hi  disc - Sect.~\\ref{sec:n1436gas}), NGC~1436 has not undergone any significant environmental interaction in the last few orbits, say \\sim1 Gyr.$\n",
       "$Thus we wonder \"whether\", \"when\" and \"how\" interactions with the Fornax cluster environment were relevant for the history of NGC 1436.$\n",
       "$Useful insights come from our reconstructed SFH for the inner and outer disc of this galaxy. The SFH of the quiescent and star-forming disc of Fig.~\\ref{fig:SFHs_allexp} indeed suggests that NGC~1436 was not a member of the cluster earlier than \\sim6 Gyr ago, with the Fornax environment becoming relevant for its evolution starting around 5~Gyr ago.$\n",
       "$Indeed, between 14 and 5 Gyr NGC~1436 seem to have followed the expected cosmic evolution for star-formation activity  \\citep{2018A&A...615A..27L} while also following a typical inside-out evolution.$\n",
       "$That is, up to \\sim5 Gyr ago NGC~1436 seems to have formed its stars as a regular spiral in a low-density environment, without being affected by strong tidal or hydrodynamical interactions.$\n",
       "$Since entering the cluster it must have taken \\sim 1 Gyr for NGC~1436 to reach its first pericentre passage (\\tau_\\mathrm{cross} is indeed about 2 Gyr for Fornax where R_\\mathrm{vir}~=~700~kpc and \\sigma_\\mathrm{cl}~=~318~\\kms, \\citealp[]{drinkwater2001substructure}) when interactions between the galaxy and the Fornax environment would have been more extreme.$\n",
       "$Drawing from the inferred rise and decline of star formation activity, we thus speculate that \\sim4 Gyr ago, at about pericentre, a tidal interaction and/or ram-pressure was able to compress and then remove the majority of the \\hi  content from the galaxy outer disc, causing a temporary SFR enhancement followed by a rapid quenching of its star formation. NGC 1436 could only keep some \\hi  within the inner star forming disc thanks to the stronger gravitational binding. However, by the time gas removal from the outer disc was complete, the accretion of cold gas onto the galaxy must have completely stopped. Therefore, the subsequent evolution (with NGC~1436 now moving away from pericentre) must have been characterised by a fully quenched outer disc and a starving inner disc. This would explain why the SFR of the inner disc has decreased in the last few Gyr, but not gone to zero. The lookback time of the environmental interactions, which caused the enhancement of the SFR, is consistent with the conclusion of \\cite{IodiceF3D} that NGC 1436 is an intermediate infaller in Fornax.$\n",
       "$The relative role that gravitational and hydrodynamical processes might have played to drive such a morphological transformation is not clear.$\n",
       "$In the literature there is evidence that both tidal interactions and ram pressure might separately trigger a temporary enhancement in star-formation activity and the removal of cold gas \\citep{1972ApJ...178..623T,2004MNRAS.350..798B,2008MNRAS.385.1903L,2017ApJ...844...48P,2018ApJ...866L..25V,Mpati2019MNRAS.487.4580R, 2022A&A...659A..94M}. Alternatively, a combination of both gravitational (possibly a merger) and hydrodynamical interactions might have been at work in the specific case of NGC~1436. For example, NGC~1436 might have experienced tidal interaction near pericentre, which may have triggered a central SFR enhancement while, at the same time, moving some gas to large radius via tidal forces, from where it could more easily be stripped by ram pressure. In this case, NGC~1436 would share a similar evolutionary path to that of the Fornax galaxies with one-sided HI tails described in \\cite{2023arXiv230211895S}.$\n",
       "$Interestingly, the recent evolution of NGC~1436 can also be observed in cosmological simulations. For instance, looking at the TNG50 simulation \\citep{Pillepich19}, among the 16 present-day disc galaxy found in Fornax-like environments \\citep{PabloTNG50} we find six currently star-forming objects that entered their cluster environment between 3 and 5 Gyrs ago and had only one pericentre passage.$\n",
       "$Among these, the left panel of Fig~\\ref{fig:sfr_tng} shows the SFH of the simulated galaxy that matched more closely the one inferred from our SFH analysis. The right panel of this figure shows that the disc of this simulated object also appears to be  forming stars only in its inner part while its outskirts have already been quenched, as for NGC~1436.$\n",

       "$Using \\hi  cubes from the MeerKAT Fornax Survey \\citep{2023arXiv230211895S}, with a resolution of 11\\arcsec~and 66\\arcsec, sensitivity N_{\\mathrm{HI}}(3\\sigma,~25~\\mathrm{km s^{-1}})~=~4.5\\times10^{19}~cm^{-2} and 1.3\\times10^{18}~cm^{-2}, respectively, and a spectral resolution of \\sim1.4\\kms, we have investigated the distribution and kinematics of the \\hi  in NGC~1436 finding that: \\emph{(i)} the \\hi  distribution is truncated within the inner and still star-forming disc \\emph{(ii)} the \\hi  kinematics is consistent with that of \\htwo  \\citep{zabel} and ionized gas \\citep{IodiceF3D}, and thus NGC~1436 has not experience any recent environmental interactions in the last \\sim1~Gyr (a few orbital times of the interstellar medium).$\n",
       "$With Fornax~3D data \\citep{sarzi2018A&A...616A.121S}, we further reconstructed the SFHs of the outer (currently quiescent) and inner (still star-forming) part of the disc of NGC~1436, which show (\\emph{i}) a faster evolution of the inner disc with respect to the outer disc from 14 to 5 Gyr ago (\\emph{ii}) a burst of star formation \\sim4 ago in both parts of the disc (\\emph{iii}) a steady decline and a fast quenching of the star formation activity in the inner and outer disc, respectively.$\n",
       "$These findings suggest that before the star formation burst, NGC~1436 was evolving in a low-density environment outside the Fornax cluster. While falling into the cluster and approaching its pericentre, environmental interactions have promoted a temporary enhancement in SFR. These interactions were also able to remove \\hi  from the outskirts of the galaxy, which caused the fast quenching of the outer disc. The lack of subsequent cold gas accretion onto the inner disc is causing its current slow quenching.$\n",

       "$for understanding both the past and on-going impact of gravitational and hydrodynamic processes on galaxies moving from low to high density environments.$\n",
       "$As a next step, we will apply the stellar-population analysis approach used for NGC~1436 to the other galaxies in the Fornax cluster with available VLT-MUSE data and detected with MeerKAT. Mainly coming from Fornax3D sample (\\citealp{sarzi2018A&A...616A.121S}), they will result in a sample of 13 galaxies covering a range of HI morphologies, galaxy mass, and position within the cluster that will new an ideal basis for further comparisons with the predictions from numerical simulations.$\n",
       "$At the same time, we intend to improve our constraints on the young stellar population by taking also into account data extending beyond the MUSE spectral range. For instance, we intend to collect near-IR data using the NIRWALS integral-field spectrograph \\citep{2018SPIE10702E..2OW} mounted on the South African Large Telescope (SALT), which will cover absorption bands from thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch stars that are good indicators of intermediate age populations (between 0.3 and 2 Gyr, \\citealp{2005MNRAS.362..799M}).$\n",

       "$We study the evolutionary path of the Fornax cluster galaxy NGC~1436, which is known to be currently transitioning from a spiral into a lenticular morphology. This galaxy hosts an inner star-forming disc and an outer quiescent disc, and we analyse data from the MeerKAT Fornax Survey, ALMA, and the Fornax~3D survey to study the interstellar medium and the stellar populations of both disc components.$\n",
       "$Thanks to the combination of high resolution and sensitivity of the MeerKAT data, we find that the \\hi  is entirely confined within the inner star-forming disc, and that its kinematics is coincident with that of the \\htwo .

       "$The star formation history derived from the Fornax~3D data shows that both the inner and outer disc experienced a burst of star formation \\sim5 Gyr ago, followed by rapid quenching in the outer disc and by slow quenching in the inner disc, which continues forming stars to this day. We claim that NGC~1436 has begun to effectively interact with the cluster environment 5~Gyr ago, when a combination of gravitational and hydrodynamical interactions caused the temporary enhancement of the star-formation rate. Furthermore, due to the weaker gravitational binding \\hi  was stripped from the outer disc, causing its rapid quenching. At the same time, accretion of gas onto the inner disc stopped, causing slow quenching in this region.$\n",

       "$Due to their discy structure and old stellar populations lenticular galaxies (S0s) share properties both with spirals and ellipticals \\citep{1936rene.book.....H, 1976ApJ...206..883V}.$\n",
       "$The distribution and fractional number of lenticular galaxies in the Universe at different epochs (lower at higher redshift and outside groups and clusters of galaxies) suggest that they form mainly (but not always, c.f. \\citealp{2009ApJ...702.1502V}) from the evolution of blue star-forming spiral galaxies in dense environments \\citep{dressler1980galaxy,dres_1997ApJ...490..577D,2000ApJ...542..673F,2005ApJ...623..721P}.$\n",
       "$Although there are still many open questions about how this morphological transformation happens, it is clear that environmental interactions can play an important role (e.g.~\\citealp{1983ApJ...264...24M,1996Natur.379..613M}).$\n",
       "$A peculiar characteristic of the morphological evolution of galaxies in dense environments is that it proceeds outside-in.$\n",
       "$This transformation requires, in the first place, to stop cold gas accretion onto galaxies, which would otherwise supply material to form new stars. This process is commonly referred to as \"starvation\" \\citep{1980ApJ...237..692L}.$\n",
       "$Then, the cold gas, mainly made of neutral atomic hydrogen (\\hi ), may be actively removed from the outer disc, where the weaker gravitational potential is not able to hold it in place against the action of environmental interactions. Therefore, whereas the outskirts of galaxies, which are experiencing cold gas removal, are quenched quickly if no further cold gas is supplied, star formation can continue in the inner - and still \\hi  rich - part of these systems. The outside-in transformation of galaxies which live in dense environments is opposite to what happens to field and void galaxies, where accretion of gas from the intergalactic medium generally keeps fuelling star-formation in the outer disc (e.g. \\citealp{2000MNRAS.312..497B,boselligavazzi,bosellifateofspirals2006ApJ...651..811B}).$\n",
       "$Through the study of the distribution and kinematics of the cold gas, one can gain information on which kind of interactions a galaxy might have experienced after its starvation has begun (if at all). On the one hand hydrodynamical interactions (e.g. ram pressure stripping \\citealp{1972ApJ...176....1G,1999MNRAS.308..947A,2000Sci...288.1617Q}), which only affect the gas component, cause highly asymmetric perturbations in the cold gas distribution, producing \\hi  tails which trail along the orbit of the galaxy. On the other hand, the footprint of tidal interactions in the cold gas distribution and possibly in the stellar disc is more symmetric as one can see in some two tailed objects in \\cite{1966apg..book.....A}, whose evolutionary scenarios are discussed and modelled by \\cite{2012MNRAS.422.2444S}. Indeed, these interactions can cause two long streams of material in opposite directions (although they can have very different sizes).$\n",
       "$The main difference between starvation and starvation plus active gas removal concerns different quenching time scales. Although in the literature there are several newcommandinitions of quenching timescale (see \\citealp{Lucareview_2021PASA...38...35C} for a discussion), starvation implies longer time scales for a galaxy to halt its star formation (roughly 4~Gyr; \\citealp{2014A&A...564A..66B}) with respect to the shorter time scales due to active gas removal (of the order of a few hundreds of Myr).$\n",
       "$If the study of the cold gas distribution and kinematics can help us understand the cause of relatively recent gas removal, the analysis of the stellar populations and, thus, of the star formation history (SFH) of a galaxy is crucial to distinguish between slow (starvation-like) and fast (stripping-like) quenching.$\n",
       "$One of the members of the nearby Fornax galaxy cluster (distance \\sim20~Mpc; \\citealp[]{2001ApJ...550..503J,2001ApJ...546..681T,blakeslee2009acs,Spriggs21}), NGC~1436 (FCC~290), is a perfect target to study \"how\" and \"how quickly\" the evolution of spirals into S0's can happen in dense environments. This galaxy is located \\sim0.5\\timesR_{\\rm vir}~=~350~kpc$\n",
       "$south-east from the center of the cluster, and it has a systemic velocity of 1392\\kms similar to the recessional velocity of the Fornax cluster (1442\\kms, \\citealp{Maddox2019}). Neither the 2D distribution of the Fornax galaxies nor their position in the projected phase space diagram \\citep{IodiceF3D} show any obvious companion for NGC~1436. The closest galaxy with a known redshift is FCC~298, which is at 17\\arcmin \\sim100~kpc,~ and \\sim230\\kms away from NGC~1436. Deep optical observations from the Fornax Deep Survey \\citep{Reynier_2020arXiv200812633P} suggest that NGC~1436 is in the transitional stage to become a S0 \\citep{iodiceFDS2019,FDS_RAJ}.$\n",
       "$In Fig.~\\ref{fig:opt_r25} we see that the disc of NGC~1436 shows two distinct parts: a clumpy inner disc with a tightly wound spiral structure, abundant dust with numerous star-forming regions, and an outer disc which appears featureless (no dust, spiral arms, or star forming regions). \\cite{FDS_RAJ} measured a break in the surface brightness slope at their boundary.$\n",
       "$Data from the Fornax 3D survey \\citep{sarzi2018A&A...616A.121S} obtained with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the ESO Very Large Telescope also show how this galaxy is still forming stars in the inner disc (see the H\\alpha emission in Fig.~\\ref{fig:opt_r25}) while its outskirts appear to be already quenched \\citep{iodiceFDS2019}. This is further supported by the  Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) measurement of \\cite{zabel}, which reveals the presence of molecular gas only within the inner disc. \\cite{zabel2021MNRAS.502.4723Z} found that the radial profile of the \\htwoVERO-to-dust ratio in NGC~1436 drops suddenly at a radius of 3.5~kpc, suggesting that environmental interactions were more efficient in removing dust rather than \\htwoVERO.$\n",
       "$\\placefigopt$\n",
       "$In this multi-wavelength picture of NGC~1436, high resolution \\hi  data were still missing. Indeed, the \\hi  resolution and sensitivity of the recent interferometric ATCA \\hi  survey of Fornax (\\sim1\\arcmin~and \\sim10^7~M_\\odot, respectively; \\citealp[]{loni21}) are insufficient to \\emph{(i)} establish whether the galaxy has recently interacted with the cluster environment \\emph{(ii)} recover the same total \\hi  flux of a single dish (the ATCA \\hi  flux is 2.8\\times lower than that measured with the Green Bank Telescope -- by \\citealp{courtoisGBT}).$\n",

       "$We then compare the \\hi  distribution and kinematics with those of \\htwo  \\citep{zabel}. This will establish whether the cold gas disc is well settled (if they are both distributed regularly and co-rotate), and thus whether NGC~1436 is currently in a state of slow evolution (no sign of recent interactions such as asymmetries). Finally, using MUSE data from the Fornax 3D survey \\citep{sarzi2018A&A...616A.121S}, we measure and compare the SFH of the inner star-forming disc with that of the outer quiescent disc. By performing this analysis, we aim to understand in which epoch environmental interactions might have become relevant for this galaxy, and what consequences these had for its evolution.$\n",
       "$The paper is organized as follows: in Sect~\\ref{sec:observations} we present the MeerKAT, ALMA and MUSE data.

Between these two approaches, we obtained better results modelling NGC~1436 with a flat disc. We further improve the output flat disc model by using an advanced feature of TiRiFiC, which allows us to fit and interpolate some model parameters in groups of model rings rather than for each ring independently.

Since each MILES model corresponds to a stellar population with an initial mass of one solar mass, accounting for the distance to the object allows us to turn each of these weights into a stellar mass formed at the look back time corresponding to the age of the i-th SSP model. Given that only a few SSP templates receive a non-zero weight during the GandALF fit, to estimate the SFH in each sector s we bin the resulting initial stellar-mass values M_{i,s}^\\mathrm{SSP} in 1-Gyr-wide age bins between 0 and 6~Gyr and in 2-Gyr-wide bins beyond that. Dividing the total stellar mass M_s(t_j) formed in the j-th time bin by the corresponding time bin width \\Delta t_j, we obtain the average star-formation rate (SFR) in that bin \\mathrm{\\emph{SFR}}_s(t_j) = M_s(t_j)/\\Delta t_j.

The presence of such young stars is at odds with the notable absence of any star-formation activity and it is certainly a bias in the template mix adjustment process, which in turn may stem from intrinsic limitations in our ability to constrain the presence of young stellar populations using the MUSE spectra, as indeed these do not extend down to important features (e.g. the D4000 break and H\\delta).$\n",

In fact, the steeper decline in star-formation activity in the inner regions at these earlier times, is consistent with the commonly observed inside-out evolution of disc galaxies \\citep[e.g.,][]{Kepner99,Nelson16, Johnston22}.$\n",

       "$Several properties of the multi-phase gas disc indicate that NGC 1436 has not experienced any significant tidal or hydrodynamical interaction in recent times: (\\emph{i}) the highly symmetric morphology and settled kinematics of the \\hi  disc observed with MeerKAT at a resolution of \\sim 10\\arcsec \\sim 1~kpc; (\\emph{ii}) the absence of \\hi  disturbances, asymmetries or tails down to a column density of \\sim10^{18} cm^{-2}  (resolution \\sim 60\\arcsec\\sim 6~kpc); \\emph{(iii)} the perfect match between the regular morphology and kinematics of the various gas phases (atomic, molecular and ionised). The fact that the disc is settled now, does not imply that NGC~1436 has never experienced environmental interactions in the past. For example, in the Virgo cluster, some of the most gas-poor galaxies which went through ram-pressure stripping are symmetric systems with a severely truncated \\hi  disc \\citep{2017ApJ...838...81Y}.$\n",
       "$That is, after a few orbital periods any sign of interactions would disappear. Given the orbital time of NGC~1436 (300 Myr at the edge of the \\hi  disc - Sect.~\\ref{sec:n1436gas}), NGC~1436 has not undergone any significant environmental interaction in the last few orbits, say \\sim1 Gyr.$\n",
       "$Thus we wonder \"whether\", \"when\" and \"how\" interactions with the Fornax cluster environment were relevant for the history of NGC 1436.$\n",
       "$Useful insights come from our reconstructed SFH for the inner and outer disc of this galaxy. The SFH of the quiescent and star-forming disc of Fig.~\\ref{fig:SFHs_allexp} indeed suggests that NGC~1436 was not a member of the cluster earlier than \\sim6 Gyr ago, with the Fornax environment becoming relevant for its evolution starting around 5~Gyr ago.$\n",
       "$Indeed, between 14 and 5 Gyr NGC~1436 seem to have followed the expected cosmic evolution for star-formation activity  \\citep{2018A&A...615A..27L} while also following a typical inside-out evolution.$\n",
       "$That is, up to \\sim5 Gyr ago NGC~1436 seems to have formed its stars as a regular spiral in a low-density environment, without being affected by strong tidal or hydrodynamical interactions.$\n",
       "$Since entering the cluster it must have taken \\sim 1 Gyr for NGC~1436 to reach its first pericentre passage (\\tau_\\mathrm{cross} is indeed about 2 Gyr for Fornax where R_\\mathrm{vir}~=~700~kpc and \\sigma_\\mathrm{cl}~=~318~\\kms, \\citealp[]{drinkwater2001substructure}) when interactions between the galaxy and the Fornax environment would have been more extreme.$\n",
       "$Drawing from the inferred rise and decline of star formation activity, we thus speculate that \\sim4 Gyr ago, at about pericentre, a tidal interaction and/or ram-pressure was able to compress and then remove the majority of the \\hi  content from the galaxy outer disc, causing a temporary SFR enhancement followed by a rapid quenching of its star formation. NGC 1436 could only keep some \\hi  within the inner star forming disc thanks to the stronger gravitational binding. However, by the time gas removal from the outer disc was complete, the accretion of cold gas onto the galaxy must have completely stopped. Therefore, the subsequent evolution (with NGC~1436 now moving away from pericentre) must have been characterised by a fully quenched outer disc and a starving inner disc. This would explain why the SFR of the inner disc has decreased in the last few Gyr, but not gone to zero. The lookback time of the environmental interactions, which caused the enhancement of the SFR, is consistent with the conclusion of \\cite{IodiceF3D} that NGC 1436 is an intermediate infaller in Fornax.$\n",
       "$The relative role that gravitational and hydrodynamical processes might have played to drive such a morphological transformation is not clear.$\n",
       "$In the literature there is evidence that both tidal interactions and ram pressure might separately trigger a temporary enhancement in star-formation activity and the removal of cold gas \\citep{1972ApJ...178..623T,2004MNRAS.350..798B,2008MNRAS.385.1903L,2017ApJ...844...48P,2018ApJ...866L..25V,Mpati2019MNRAS.487.4580R, 2022A&A...659A..94M}. Alternatively, a combination of both gravitational (possibly a merger) and hydrodynamical interactions might have been at work in the specific case of NGC~1436. For example, NGC~1436 might have experienced tidal interaction near pericentre, which may have triggered a central SFR enhancement while, at the same time, moving some gas to large radius via tidal forces, from where it could more easily be stripped by ram pressure. In this case, NGC~1436 would share a similar evolutionary path to that of the Fornax galaxies with one-sided HI tails described in \\cite{2023arXiv230211895S}.$\n",
       "$Interestingly, the recent evolution of NGC~1436 can also be observed in cosmological simulations. For instance, looking at the TNG50 simulation \\citep{Pillepich19}, among the 16 present-day disc galaxy found in Fornax-like environments \\citep{PabloTNG50} we find six currently star-forming objects that entered their cluster environment between 3 and 5 Gyrs ago and had only one pericentre passage.$\n",

The lack of subsequent cold gas accretion onto the inner disc is causing its current slow quenching.$\n",

       "$for understanding both the past and on-going impact of gravitational and hydrodynamic processes on galaxies moving from low to high density environments.$\n",
       "$As a next step, we will apply the stellar-population analysis approach used for NGC~1436 to the other galaxies in the Fornax cluster with available VLT-MUSE data and detected with MeerKAT. Mainly coming from Fornax3D sample (\\citealp{sarzi2018A&A...616A.121S}), they will result in a sample of 13 galaxies covering a range of HI morphologies, galaxy mass, and position within the cluster that will new an ideal basis for further comparisons with the predictions from numerical simulations.$\n",
       "$At the same time, we intend to improve our constraints on the young stellar population by taking also into account data extending beyond the MUSE spectral range. For instance, we intend to collect near-IR data using the NIRWALS integral-field spectrograph \\citep{2018SPIE10702E..2OW} mounted on the South African Large Telescope (SALT), which will cover absorption bands from thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch stars that are good indicators of intermediate age populations (between 0.3 and 2 Gyr, \\citealp{2005MNRAS.362..799M}).$\n",

       "**Abstract:** We study the evolutionary path of the Fornax cluster galaxy NGC 1436, which is known to be currently transitioning from a spiral into a lenticular morphology. This galaxy hosts an inner star-forming disc and an outer quiescent disc, and we analyse data from the MeerKAT Fornax Survey, ALMA, and the Fornax 3D survey to study the interstellar medium and the stellar populations of both disc components.Thanks to the combination of high resolution and sensitivity of the MeerKAT data, we find that the $\\hi$ is entirely confined within the inner star-forming disc, and that its kinematics is coincident with that of the $\\htwo$ . The cold gas disc is now well settled, which suggests that the galaxy has not been affected by any environmental interactions in the last $\\sim1$ Gyr.The star formation history derived from the Fornax 3D data shows that both the inner and outer disc experienced a burst of star formation $\\sim5$ Gyr ago, followed by rapid quenching in the outer disc and by slow quenching in the inner disc, which continues forming stars to this day. We claim that NGC 1436 has begun to effectively interact with the cluster environment 5 Gyr ago, when a combination of gravitational and hydrodynamical interactions caused the temporary enhancement of the star-formation rate. Furthermore, due to the weaker gravitational binding $\\hi$ was stripped from the outer disc, causing its rapid quenching. At the same time, accretion of gas onto the inner disc stopped, causing slow quenching in this region.\n",

The legend shows the total fluxes obtained from these data. The uncertainties on the total MeerKAT fluxes are calculated by summing in quadrature the statistical uncertainties -- derived from the local RMS and the number of independent pixels detected in each channel -- and the 10$\\%$ MeerKAT flux uncertainty measured in \\citet{2023arXiv230211895S}.

       "**Abstract:** Photoevaporative disc winds play a key role in our understanding of circumstellar disc evolution, especially in the final stages, and they might affect the planet formation process and the final location of planets. The study of transition discs (i.e. discs with a central dust cavity) is central for our understanding of the photoevaporation process and disc dispersal. However, we need to distinguish cavities created by photoevaporation from those created by giant planets. Theoretical models are necessary to identify possible observational signatures of the two different processes, and models to find the differences between the two processes are still lacking. In this paper we study a sample of transition discs obtained from radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of internally photoevaporated discs, and focus on the dust dynamics relevant for current ALMA observations. We then compared our results with gaps opened by super Earths/giant planets, finding that the photoevaporated cavity steepness depends mildly on gap size, and it is similar to that of a $\\SI{1}{M_J}$ mass planet. However, the dust density drops less rapidly inside the photoevaporated cavity compared to the planetary case due to the less efficient dust filtering. This effect is visible in the resulting spectral index, which shows a larger spectral index at the cavity edge and a shallower increase inside it with respect to the planetary case. The combination of cavity steepness and spectral index might reveal the true nature of transition discs.\n",
