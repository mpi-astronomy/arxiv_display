       "|**Abstract**| The high-energy Diffuse Gamma-Ray Background (DGRB) is expected to be produced by unresolved isotropically distributed astrophysical objects, potentially including dark matter annihilation or decay emissions in galactic or extragalactic structures. The DGRB has only been observed below 1 TeV; above this energy, upper limits have been reported. Observations or stringent limits on the DGRB above this energy could have significant multi-messenger implications, such as constraining the origin of TeV-PeV astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory, located in central Mexico at 4100 m above sea level, is sensitive to gamma rays from a few hundred GeV to several hundred TeV and continuously observes a wide field-of-view (2 sr). With its high-energy reach and large area coverage, HAWC is well-suited to notably improve searches for the DGRB at TeV energies. In this work, strict cuts have been applied to the HAWC dataset to better isolate gamma-ray air showers from background hadronic showers. The sensitivity to the DGRB was then verified using 535 days of Crab data and Monte Carlo simulations, leading to new limits above 10 TeV on the DGRB as well as prospective implications for multi-messenger studies. |"

       "|**Abstract**| Today, there exists a wide variety of algorithms dedicated to high-contrast imaging, especially for the detection and characterisation of exoplanet signals. These algorithms are tailored to address the very high contrast between the exoplanet signal(s), which can be more than two orders of magnitude fainter than the bright starlight residuals in coronagraphic images. The starlight residuals are inhomogeneously distributed and follow various timescales that depend on the observing conditions and on the target star brightness. Disentangling the exoplanet signals within the starlight residuals is therefore challenging, and new post-processing algorithms are striving to achieve more accurate astrophysical results. The Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge is a community-wide effort to develop, compare and evaluate algorithms using a set of benchmark high-contrast imaging datasets. After a first phase ran in 2020 and focused on the detection capabilities of existing algorithms, the focus of this ongoing second phase is to compare the characterisation capabilities of state-of-the-art techniques. The characterisation of planetary companions is two-fold: the astrometry (estimated position with respect to the host star) and spectrophotometry (estimated contrast with respect to the host star, as a function of wavelength). The goal of this second phase is to offer a platform for the community to benchmark techniques in a fair, homogeneous and robust way, and to foster collaborations. |"

       "|**Abstract**| We present the discovery of Bo\\\"otes V, a new ultra-faint dwarf galaxy candidate. This satellite is detected as a resolved overdensity of stars during an ongoing search for new Local Group dwarf galaxy candidates in the UNIONS photometric dataset. It has a physical half-light radius of 26.9$^{+7.5}_{-5.4}$ pc, a $V$-band magnitude of $-$4.5 $\\pm$ 0.4 mag, and resides at a heliocentric distance of approximately 100 kpc. We use Gaia DR3 astrometry to identify member stars, characterize the systemic proper motion, and confirm the reality of this faint stellar system. The brightest star in this system was followed up using Gemini GMOS-N long-slit spectroscopy and is measured to have a metallicity of [Fe/H] $=$ -2.85 $\\pm$ 0.10 dex and a heliocentric radial velocity of $v_r$ = 5.1 $\\pm$ 13.4 km s$^{-1}$. Bo\\\"otes V is larger (in terms of scale radius), more distant, and more metal-poor than the vast majority of globular clusters. It is likely that Bo\\\"otes V is an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy, though future spectroscopic studies will be necessary to definitively classify this object. |"

       "|**Abstract**| The COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY) HST/COS treasury program provides the first high-resolution spectral catalogue of 45 local high-z analogues in the UV (1200-2000{\\AA}) to investigate their stellar and gas properties. We present a toolkit of UV interstellar medium (ISM) diagnostics, analyzing the main emission lines of CLASSY spectra (i.e., NIV]{\\lambda}{\\lambda}1483,87, CIV{\\lambda}{\\lambda}1548,51, HeII{\\lambda}1640, OIII]{\\lambda}{\\lambda}1661,6, SiIII]{\\lambda}{\\lambda}1883,92, CIII]{\\lambda}{\\lambda}1907,9). Specifically, we focus our investigation on providing accurate diagnostics for reddening, electron density and temperature, gas-phase metallicity and ionization parameter, taking into account the different ionization zones of the ISM. We calibrate our UV toolkit using well-known optical diagnostics, analyzing archival optical spectra for all the CLASSY targets. We find that UV density diagnostics estimate ne values that are ~1-2 dex higher (e.g., ne(CIII]{\\lambda}{\\lambda}1907,9)~10^4cm^{-3}) than those inferred from their optical counterparts (e.g., ne([SII]{\\lambda}{\\lambda}6717,31)~10^2cm^{-3}). Te derived from the hybrid ratio OIII]{\\lambda}1666/[OIII]{\\lambda}5007 proves to be a reliable Te diagnostic, with differences in 12+log(O/H) within ~+/-0.3dex. We also investigate the relation between the stellar and gas E(B-V), finding consistent values at high specific star formation rates, while at low sSFR we confirm an excess of dust attenuation in the gas. Finally, we investigate UV line ratios and equivalent widths to provide correlations with 12+log(O/H) and log(U), but note there are degeneracies between the two. With this suite of UV-based diagnostics, we illustrate the pivotal role CLASSY plays in understanding the chemical and physical properties of high-z systems that JWST can observe in the rest-frame UV. |\n",

We show this couples the $H_{0}$ and $\\sigma_{8}$ tensions, providing an explanation for both simultaneously, while also providing an explanation for the anomalously large integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect from cosmic voids. Observations of high ISW from cosmic voids may therefore be evidence that dark matter plays a significant role in the $H_{0}$ and $\\sigma_{8}$ tensions. We predict the ISW from cosmic voids to be a factor of ~ 2 greater in this model than what is expected from the standard model $\\Lambda$CDM. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| We revisit the role that gravitational scattering off stars plays in establishing the steady-state distribution of collisionless dark matter (DM) around a massive black hole (BH). This is a physically interesting problem that has potentially observable signatures, such as $\\gamma-$rays from DM annihilation in a density spike. The system serves as a laboratory for comparing two different dynamical approaches, both of which have been widely used: a Fokker-Planck treatment and a two-component conduction fluid treatment. In our Fokker-Planck analysis we extend a previous analytic model to account for a nonzero flux of DM particles into the BH, as well as a cut-off in the distribution function near the BH due to relativistic effects or, further out, possible DM annihilation. In our two-fluid analysis, following an approximate analytic treatment, we recast the equations as a \"heated Bondi accretion\" problem and solve the equations numerically without approximation. While both the Fokker-Planck and two-fluid methods yield basically the same DM density and velocity dispersion profiles away from the boundaries in the spike interior, there are other differences, especially the determination of the DM accretion rate. We discuss limitations of the two treatments, including the assumption of an isotropic velocity dispersion. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| The heliosphere is the magnetic structure formed by the Sun's atmosphere extending into the local interstellar medium (ISM). The boundary separating the heliosphere from the ISM is a still largely unexplored region of space. Even though both Voyager spacecraft entered the local ISM and are delivering data, they are two points piercing a vast region of space at specific times. The heliospheric boundary regulates the penetration of MeV- GeV galactic cosmic rays (CR) in the inner heliosphere. Interstellar keV neutral atoms are crucial to the outer heliosphere since they can penetrate unperturbed and transfer energy to the solar wind. Missions such as NASA's IBEX and Cassini are designed to detect neutral atoms and monitor charge exchange processes at the heliospheric boundary. The heliosphere does not modulate the TeV CR intensity, but it does influence their arrival direction distribution. Ground-based CR observatories have provided accurate maps of CR anisotropy as a function of energy in the last couple of decades. Combining observations to produce all-sky coverage makes it possible to investigate the heliosphere's impact on TeV CR particles. We can numerically calculate the pristine TeV CR distribution in the local ISM with state-of-the-art heliosphere models. Only by subtracting the heliospheric influence is it possible to use TeV CR observations to infer propagation properties and the characteristics of magnetic turbulence in the ISM. Numerical calculations of CR particle trajectories through heliospheric models provide a complementary tool to probe the boundary region properties. A program boosting heliospheric modeling with emphasis on the boundary region and promoting combined CR experimental data analyses from multiple experiments benefits CR astrophysics and provides additional data and tools to explore the interaction between the heliosphere and the local ISM. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| We present a new calibration of the J-band absolute magnitude of the JAGB method based on thermally pulsing AGB stars that are members of Milky Way open clusters, having distances and reddenings, independently compiled and published by Marigo et al (2022). 17 of these photometrically-selected J-Branch AGB stars give M_J = -6.40 mag with a scatter of +/-0.40 mag, and a sigma on the mean of +/-0.10 mag. Combining the Milky Way field carbon star calibration of Lee et al. (2021) with this determination gives a weighted average of M_J(MW) = -6.19 +/- 0.04 mag (error on the mean). This value is statistically indistinguishable from the value determined for this population of distance indicators in the LMC and SMC, giving further evidence that JAGB stars are extremely reliable distance indicators of high luminosity and universal applicability. Combining the zero points for JAGB stars in these three systems, a value of M_J = -6.20 +/- 0.01 (stat) +/- 0.04 (sys) mag becomes our best current estimate of the JAGB zero point and its associated errors. Finally, we note that no evidence is found for any statistically significant dependence of this zero point on metallicity. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| The non-thermal filament (NTF) radio structures clustered within a few hundred parsecs of the Galactic Center (GC) are apparently unique to this region of the Galaxy. Recent radio images of the GC using MeerKAT at 1 GHz have revealed a multitude of faint, previously unknown NTF bundles (NTFBs), some of which are comprised of as many as 10 or more individual filaments. In this work we present Very Large Array (VLA) observations at C- and X-bands (4 - 12 GHz) at arcsecond-scale resolutions of three of these newly-discovered NTFBs, all located at southern Galactic latitudes. These observations allow us to compare their total-intensity properties with those of the larger NTF population. We find that these targets generally possess properties similar to what is observed in the larger NTF population. However, the larger NTF population generally has steeper spectral index values than what we observe for our chosen targets. The results presented here based on the total-intensity properties of these structures indicate that the NTFs are likely all formed from Cosmic Rays (CRs). These CRs are either generated by a nearby compact source and then diffuse along the NTF lengths or are generated by extended, magnetized structures whose magnetic field undergoes reconnection with the NTF magnetic field. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| This work presents water emission spectra at wavelengths covered by JWST (2.9-12.8 $\\mu$m) as spectrally-resolved with high resolving powers (R = 30,000-100,000) using ground-based spectrographs. Two new surveys with iSHELL and VISIR are combined with previous spectra from CRIRES and TEXES to cover parts of multiple ro-vibrational and rotational bands observable within telluric transmission bands, for a total of 85 disks and $\\approx160$ spectra. The general expectation of a range of regions and excitation conditions traced by infrared water spectra is for the first time supported by the combined kinematics and excitation as spectrally resolved at multiple wavelengths. The main findings from this analysis are: 1) water lines are progressively narrower going from the ro-vibrational bands at 2-9 $\\mu$m to the rotational lines at 12 $\\mu$m, and partly match a broad (BC) and narrow (NC) emission components, respectively, as extracted from ro-vibrational CO spectra; 2) rotation diagrams of resolved water lines from upper level energies of 4000-9500 K show curvatures indicative of optically thick emission ($\\approx 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$) from a range of excitation temperatures ($\\approx$ 800-1100 K); 3) the new 5 $\\mu$m spectra demonstrate that slab model fits to the rotational lines at $> 10 \\mu$m strongly over-predict the ro-vibrational emission bands at $< 9 \\mu$m, implying non-LTE excitation. We discuss these findings in the context of a emission from a disk surface and a molecular inner disk wind, and provide a list of detailed guidelines to support the analysis and interpretation of spectrally-unresolved JWST spectra. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| Precise control of the optical path differences (OPD) in the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) was critical for the characterization of the black hole at the center of our Galaxy - leading to the 2020 Nobel prize in physics. There is now significant effort to push these OPD limits even further, in-particular achieving 100nm OPD RMS on the 8m unit telescopes (UT's) to allow higher contrast and sensitivity at the VLTI. This work calculated the theoretical atmospheric OPD limit of the VLTI as 5nm and 15nm RMS, with current levels around 200nm and 100nm RMS for the UT and 1.8m auxillary telescopes (AT's) respectively, when using bright targets in good atmospheric conditions. We find experimental evidence for the $f^{-17/3}$ power law theoretically predicted from the effect of telescope filtering in the case of the ATs which is not currently observed for the UT's. Fitting a series of vibrating mirrors modelled as dampened harmonic oscillators, we were able to model the UT OPD PSD of the gravity fringe tracker to $<1nm/\\sqrt{Hz}$ RMSE up to 100Hz, which could adequately explain a hidden $f^{-17/3}$ power law on the UTs. Vibration frequencies in the range of 60-90Hz and also 40-50Hz were found to generally dominate the closed loop OPD residuals of Gravity. Cross correlating accelerometer with Gravity data, it was found that strong contributions in the 40-50Hz range are coming from the M1-M3 mirrors, while a significant portion of power from the 60-100Hz contributions are likely coming from between the M4-M10. From the vibrating mirror model it was shown that achieving sub 100nm OPD RMS for particular baselines (that have OPD$\\sim$200nm RMS) required removing nearly all vibration sources below 100Hz. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| The bright blazar OJ~287 routinely parades high brightness bremsstrahlung flares which are explained as being a result of a secondary supermassive black hole (SMBH) impacting the accretion disk of a primary SMBH in a binary system. We begin by showing that these flares occur at times predicted by a simple analytical formula, based on the Kepler equation, which explains flares since 1888. The next impact flare, namely the flare number 26, is rather peculiar as it breaks the typical pattern of two impact flares per 12 year cycle. This will be the third bremsstrahlung flare of the current cycle that follows the already observed 2015 and 2019 impact flares from OJ~287. Unfortunately, astrophysical considerations make it difficult to predict the exact arrival epoch of the flare number 26. In the second part of the paper, we describe our recent OJ~287 observations. They show that the pre-flare light curve of flare number 22, observed in 2005, exhibits similar activity as the pre-flare light curve in 2022, preceding the expected flare number 26 in our model. We argue that the pre-flare activity most likely arises in the primary jet whose activity is modulated by the transit of the secondary SMBH through the accretion disk of the primary. Observing the next impact flare of OJ~287 in October 2022 will substantiate the theory of disk impacts in binary black hole systems. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| The overabundance of gas molecules in the coldest regions of space point to a non-thermal desorption process. Laboratory simulations show an efficient desorption of CO ice exposed to ultraviolet radiation, known as photodesorption, which decreases for increasing ice deposition temperature. However, the understanding of this abnormal phenomenon has remained elusive. In this work we show the same phenomenon, and in particular, a dramatic drop in the photodesorption yield is observed when the deposition temperature is 19 K and higher. Also the minimum ice thickness that accounts for a constant photodesorption yield of CO ice is deposition temperature dependent, an observation reported here for the first time. We propose that the key parameters that dominate the absorbed photon energy transfer in CO ice, and contribute to the measured photodesorption yields are the energy transfer length, single ice layer contributed desorption yield, and relative effective surface area. This set of parameters should be incorporated in astrophysical models that simulate photodesorption of the top CO-rich ice layer on icy dust populations with the size distribution which is ice thickness related. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| The cosmic curvature $\\Omega_{K,0}$, which determines the spatial geometry of the universe, is an important parameter in modern cosmology. Any deviation from $\\Omega_{K,0}=0$ would have a profound impact on primordial inflation paradigm and fundamental physics. In this work, we adopt a model-independent method to test whether $\\Omega_{K,0}$ deviates from zero. We use the Gaussian process to reconstruct the reduced Hubble parameter $E(z)$ and the derivative of distance $D'(z)$ from observational data, and then determine $\\Omega_{K,0}$ with a null test relation. The cosmic chronometer (CC) Hubble data, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) Hubble data, and supernovae Pantheon sample are considered. Our result is consistent with a spatially flat universe within the domain of reconstruction $0<z<2.3$, at the $1\\sigma$ confidence level. In the redshift interval $0<z<1$, the result favors a flat universe, while at $z>1$, it tends to favor a closed universe. In this sense, there is still a possibility for a closed universe. We also carry out the null test of the cosmic curvature at $0<z<4.5$ using the simulated gravitational wave standard sirens, CC+BAO and redshift drift Hubble data. The result shows that in the future, with the synergy of multiple high-quality observations, we can tightly constrain the spatial geometry or exclude the flat universe. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| We report 1,656 new star clusters found in the Galactic disk (|b|<20 degrees) beyond 1.2 kpc, using Gaia EDR3 data. Based on an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, DBSCAN, and followed our previous studies, we utilized a unique method to do the data preparation and obtained the clustering coefficients, which proved to be an effective way to search blindly for star clusters. We tabulated the physical parameters and member stars of the new clusters, and presented some interesting examples, including a globular cluster candidate. The cluster parameters and member stars are available at CDS via anonymous ftp to https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/ftp/vizier.submit//he22c. We examined the new discoveries and discussed their statistical properties. The proper motion dispersions and radii of the new clusters were the same as the previously reported ones. The new star clusters beyond 1.2 kpc were older than those in the solar neighborhood, and the new objects found in the third Galactic quadrant presented the lowest line-of-sight extinctions. Combined with our previous results, the total population of new clusters detected through our method was 2,541, corresponding to 55% of all newly published clusters in the Gaia era. The number of cataloged Gaia star clusters was also increased to nearly six thousand. In the near future, it is necessary to make a unified confirmation and member star determination for all reported clusters. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| The cold dark matter (CDM) structure formation scenario faces challenges on (sub)galactic scales, central among them being the `cusp-core' problem. A known remedy, driving CDM out of galactic centres, invokes interactions with baryons, through fluctuations in the gravitational potential arising from feedback or orbiting clumps of gas or stars. Here we interpret core formation in a hydrodynamic simulation in terms of a theoretical formulation, which may be considered a generalisation of Chandrasekhar's theory of two body relaxation to the case when the density fluctuations do not arise from white noise; it presents a simple characterisation of the effects of complex hydrodynamics and `subgrid physics'. The power spectrum of gaseous fluctuations is found to follow a power law over a range of scales, appropriate for a fully turbulent compressible medium. The potential fluctuations leading to core formation are nearly normally distributed, which allows for the energy transfer leading to core formation to be described as a standard diffusion process, initially increasing the velocity dispersion of test particles as in Chandrasekhar's theory. We calculate the energy transfer from the fluctuating gas to the halo and find it consistent with theoretical expectations. We also examine how the initial kinetic energy input to halo particles is redistributed to form a core. The temporal mass decrease inside the forming core may be fit by an exponential form; a simple prescription based on our model associates the characteristic timescale with an energy relaxation time. We compare the resulting theoretical density distribution with that in the simulation. |\n",

The path to understanding the causes of early- and late-time acceleration depends on fully leveraging ongoing surveys, developing and demonstrating new technologies, and constructing and operating new instruments. This report presents a multi-faceted vision for the cosmic survey program in the 2030s and beyond that derives from these considerations. Cosmic surveys address a wide range of fundamental physics questions, and are thus a unique and powerful component of the HEP experimental portfolio. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| Measurements of the stellar coronal magnetic field are of great importance in understanding the stellar magnetic activity, yet the measurements have been extremely difficult. Recent studies proposed a new method of magnetic field measurements based on the magnetic-field-induced-transition (MIT) of the Fe~{\\sc{x}} ion. Here we construct a series of stellar coronal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) models and synthesize several Fe~{\\sc{x}} emission lines at extreme-ultraviolet wavelengths, and then diagnose the magnetic field strength at the bases of the coronae using the MIT technique. Our results show that the technique can be applied to some stars with magnetic fields more than three times higher than that of the Sun at solar maximum. Furthermore, we investigate the uncertainty of the derived magnetic field strength caused by photon counting error and find that a signal-noise ratio of $\\sim$50 for the Fe~{\\sc{x}} 175 {\\AA}~line is required to achieve effective measurements of the stellar coronal magnetic field. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| We present results from nine simulations that compare the standard $\\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter cosmology ($\\Lambda$CDM) with counterfactual universes, for approximately $100\\,{\\rm Gyr}$ using the Enzo simulation code. We vary the value of $\\Lambda$ and the fluctuation amplitude to explore the effect on the evolution of the halo mass function (HMF), the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the star formation history (SFH). The distinct peak in star formation rate density (SFRD) and its subsequent decline are both affected by the interplay between gravitational attraction and the accelerating effects of $\\Lambda$. The IGM cools down more rapidly in models with a larger $\\Lambda$ and also with a lower $\\sigma_8$, reflecting the reduced SFRD associated with these changes -- although changing $\\sigma_8$ is not degenerate with changing $\\Lambda$, either regarding the thermal history of the IGM or the SFH. However, these induced changes to the IGM or ionizing background have little impact on the calculated SFRD. We provide fits for the evolution of the SFRD in these different universes, which we integrate over time to derive an asymptotic star formation efficiency. Together with Weinberg's uniform prior on $\\Lambda$, the estimated probability of observers experiencing a value of $\\Lambda$ no greater than the observed value is 13%, substantially larger than some alternative estimates. Within the Enzo model framework, then, observer selection within a multiverse is able to account statistically for the small value of the cosmological constant, although $\\Lambda$ in our universe does appear to be at the low end of the predicted range. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| The next generation of Extremely Large Telescope (24 to 39m diameter) will suffer from the so-called \"pupil fragmentation\" problem. Due to their pupil shape complexity (segmentation, large spiders ...), some differential pistons may appear between some isolated part of the full pupil during the observations. Although classical AO system will be able to correct for turbulence effects, they will be blind to this specific telescope induced perturbations. Hence, such differential piston, a.k.a petal modes, will prevent to reach the diffraction limit of the telescope and ultimately will represent the main limitation of AO-assisted observation with an ELT. In this work we analyse the spatial structure of these petal modes and how it affects the ability of a Pyramid Wavefront sensor to sense them. Then we propose a variation around the classical Pyramid concept for increasing the WFS sensitivity to this particular modes. Nevertheless, We show that one single WFS can not accurately and simultaneously measure turbulence and petal modes. We propose a double path wavefront sensor scheme to solve this problem. We show that such a scheme,associated to a spatial filtering of residual turbulence in the second WFS path dedicated to petal mode sensing, allows to fully measure and correct for both turbulence and fragmentation effects and will eventually restore the full capability and spatial resolution of the future ELT. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| The equation of state (EoS) that describes extremely dense matter under strong interactions is not completely understood. One reason is that the first-principle calculations of the EoS at finite chemical potential are challenging in nuclear physics. However, neutron star observables like masses, radii, moment of inertia and tidal deformability are direct probes to the EoS and hence make the EoS reconstruction task feasible. In this work, we present results from a novel deep learning technique that optimizes a parameterized equation of state in the automatic differentiation framework. We predict stellar structures from a pre-trained Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) solver network, given an EoS represented by neural networks. The latest observational data of neutron stars, specifically their masses and radii, are used to implement the chi-square fitting. We optimize the parameters of the neural network EoS by minimizing the error between observations and predictions. The well-trained neural network EoS gives an estimate of the relationship between the pressure and the mass density. The results presented are consistent with those from conventional approaches and the experimental bound on the tidal deformability inferred from the gravitational wave event, GW170817. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| In the Letter, interesting evidence is reported to support a central tidal disruption event (TDE) in the known AGN NGC 1097. Considering the motivations of TDE as one probable origination of emission materials of double-peaked broad emission lines and also as one probable explanation to changing-look AGN, it is interesting to check whether are there clues to support a TDE in NGC 1097, not only a changing-look AGN but also an AGN with double-peaked broad emission lines. Under the assumption that the onset of broad H$\\alpha$ emission was due to a TDE, the 13years-long (1991-2004) variability of double-peaked broad H$\\alpha$ line flux in NGC 1097 can be well predicted by theoretical TDE model, with a $(1-1.5){\\rm M_\\odot}$ main-sequence star tidally disrupted by the central BH with TDE model determined mass about $(5-8)\\times10^7{\\rm M_\\odot}$. The results provide interesting evidence to not only support TDE-related origin of double-peaked broad line emission materials but also support TDE as an accepted physical explanation to physical properties of changing-look AGN. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| In this paper, we present TESS photometry and high-resolution spectra of the short-period Algol EW Boo. We obtained double-lined radial velocities (RVs) from the time-series spectra and measured the effective temperature of the primary star as $T_{\\rm{eff,1}}$ = 8560 $\\pm$ 118 K. For the orbital period study, we collected all times of minima available for over the last 30 years. It was found that the eclipse timing variation of the system could be represented by a periodic oscillation of 17.6 $\\pm$ 0.3 years with a semi-amplitude of 0.0041 $\\pm$ 0.0001 d. The orbital and physical parameters were derived by simultaneously analyzing the TESS light and RV curves using the Wilson-Devinney (WD) binary star modeling code. The component masses and radii were showed over 3% precision: $M_{1}$ = 2.67 $\\pm $ 0.08 M$_{\\odot}$, $M_{2}$ = 0.43 $\\pm $ 0.01 M$_{\\odot}$, $R_{1}$ = 2.01 $\\pm $ 0.02 R$_{\\odot}$, and $R_{2}$ = 1.35 $\\pm $ 0.01 R$_{\\odot}$. Furthermore, multiple frequency analyses were performed for the light-curve residuals from the WD model. As a result, we detected 17 pressure-mode pulsations in the region of 40.15 - 52.37 d$^{-1}$. The absolute dimensions and pulsation characteristics showed that the $\\delta$ Sct pulsator was the more massive and hotter primary star of the EW Boo. |\n",

The mean densities derived from the integrated [SII] 6716/6731\\r{A}, fluxes along the Keck HIRES slit length indicate a density range of 10$^{3.7}$ to 10$^{4.1}$ cm$^{-3}$, while the local densities derived from the slit spectral images show a large local density variation of about 10$^{2.8}$ - 10$^{4.6}$ cm$^{-3}$: local densities vary substantially more than values integrated over the line of sight. The expansion rates of the main and outer shells obtained by [SII] are about 21.7 and 30.0 kms$^{-1}$, respectively. The kinematic results of the [SII] spectral lines correspond to the outermost regions of the two shells and are not representative of the whole PN but are closely related to the other emission lines observed in the shell gas. We conclude that the density contrast leads to the formation of the inner shell, while the change in ionization state leads to the formation of the outer shell. We suggest that the inner main and outer shells result from two successive major ejections. The physical conditions of the central star must have been different when these shells first formed. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| Cold dark matter haloes are expected to be triaxial, and so appear elliptical in projection. We use weak gravitational lensing from the Canada-France Imaging Survey (CFIS) component of the Ultraviolet-Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) to measure the ellipticity of the dark matter haloes around Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (DR7) and from the CMASS and LOWZ samples of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), assuming their major axes are aligned with the stellar light. We find that DR7 LRGs with masses $M \\sim 2.5\\times10^{13} \\textrm{M}_{\\odot}/h$ have halo ellipticities $e=0.35\\pm0.09$. Expressed as a fraction of the galaxy ellipticity, we find $f_h = 1.4\\pm0.4$. For BOSS LRGs, the detection is of marginal significance: $e = 0.17\\pm0.10$ and $f_h=0.1\\pm0.4$. These results are in agreement with other measurements of halo ellipticity from weak lensing and, taken together with previous results, suggest an increase of halo ellipticity of $0.10\\pm0.05$ per decade in halo mass. This trend agrees with the predictions from hydrodynamical simulations, which find that at higher halo masses, not only do dark matter haloes become more elliptical, but that the misalignment between major axis of the stellar light in the central galaxy and that of the dark matter decreases. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| SPECULOOS is a ground-based transit survey consisting of six identical 1-m robotic telescopes. The immediate goal of the project is to detect temperate terrestrial planets transiting nearby ultracool dwarfs (late M-dwarf stars and brown dwarfs), which could be amenable for atmospheric research with the next generation of telescopes. Here, we report the developments of the northern counterpart of the project - SPECULOOS Northern Observatory, and present its performance during the first three years of operations from mid-2019 to mid-2022. Currently, the observatory consists of one telescope, which is named Artemis. The Artemis telescope demonstrates remarkable photometric precision, allowing it to be ready to detect new transiting terrestrial exoplanets around ultracool dwarfs. Over the period of the first three years after the installation, we observed 96 objects from the SPECULOOS target list for 6000 hours with a typical photometric precision of $0.5\\%$, and reaching a precision of $0.2\\%$ for relatively bright non-variable targets with a typical exposure time of 25 sec. Our weather downtime (clouds, high wind speed, high humidity, precipitation and/or high concentration of dust particles in the air) over the period of three years was 30% of overall night time. Our actual downtime is 40% because of additional time loss associated with technical problems. |\n",

       "**Abstract:** The high-energy Diffuse Gamma-Ray Background (DGRB) is expected to be produced by unresolved isotropically distributed astrophysical objects, potentially including dark matter annihilation or decay emissions in galactic or extragalactic structures. The DGRB has only been observed below 1 TeV; above this energy, upper limits have been reported. Observations or stringent limits on the DGRB above this energy could have significant multi-messenger implications, such as constraining the origin of TeV-PeV astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory, located in central Mexico at 4100 m above sea level, is sensitive to gamma rays from a few hundred GeV to several hundred TeV and continuously observes a wide field-of-view (2 sr). With its high-energy reach and large area coverage, HAWC is well-suited to notably improve searches for the DGRB at TeV energies. In this work, strict cuts have been applied to the HAWC dataset to better isolate gamma-ray air showers from background hadronic showers. The sensitivity to the DGRB was then verified using 535 days of Crab data and Monte Carlo simulations, leading to new limits above 10 TeV on the DGRB as well as prospective implications for multi-messenger studies.\n",

       "**Abstract:** Today, there exists a wide variety of algorithms dedicated to high-contrast imaging, especially for the detection and characterisation of exoplanet signals. These algorithms are tailored to address the very high contrast between the exoplanet signal(s), which can be more than two orders of magnitude fainter than the bright starlight residuals in coronagraphic images. The starlight residuals are inhomogeneously distributed and follow various timescales that depend on the observing conditions and on the target star brightness. Disentangling the exoplanet signals within the starlight residuals is therefore challenging, and new post-processing algorithms are striving to achieve more accurate astrophysical results.The Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge is a community-wide effort to develop, compare and evaluate algorithms using a set of benchmark high-contrast imaging datasets. After a first phase ran in 2020 and focused on the detection capabilities of existing algorithms, the focus of this ongoing second phase is to compare the characterisation capabilities of state-of-the-art techniques. The characterisation of planetary companions is two-fold: the astrometry (estimated position with respect to the host star) and spectrophotometry (estimated contrast with respect to the host star, as a function of wavelength).The goal of this second phase is to offer a platform for the community to benchmark techniques in a fair, homogeneous and robust way, and to foster collaborations.\n",

       "**Abstract:** We present the discovery of$\\boov$, a new ultra-faint dwarf galaxy candidate. This satellite is detected as a resolved overdensity of stars during an ongoing search for new Local Group dwarf galaxy candidates in the UNIONS photometric dataset.    It has a physical half-light radius of 26.9$^{+7.5}_{-5.4}$pc, a$V$-band magnitude of$-$4.5$\\pm$0.4 mag, and resides at a heliocentric distance of approximately 100 kpc. We use Gaia DR3 astrometry to identify member stars, characterize the systemic proper motion, and confirm the reality of this faint stellar system.    The brightest star in this system was followed up using Gemini GMOS-N long-slit spectroscopy and is measured to have a metallicity of[Fe/H]$=$-2.85$\\pm$0.10 dex and a heliocentric radial velocity of$v_r$= 5.1$\\pm$13.4$\\kms$.$\\boov$is larger (in terms of scale radius), more distant, and more metal-poor than the vast majority of globular clusters. It is likely that$\\boov$is an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy, though future spectroscopic studies will be necessary to definitively classify this object.\n",
