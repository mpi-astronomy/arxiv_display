We revisit the intermediate-field FRB model where the radio waves are generated as fast-magnetosonic waves through magnetic reconnection near the light cylinder. The current sheet in the magnetar wind is compressed by a low frequency pulse emitted from the inner magnetosphere to trigger magnetic reconnection. By incorporating the wave dynamics of the magnetosphere, we demonstrate how the FRB frequency, the single pulse width, and luminosity are determined by the period, magnetic field, QPO frequency and quake energetics of the magnetar. We find that this model can naturally and self-consistently interpret the X-ray/radio event from SGR 1935+2154 and the QPO in FRB 20191221A. It can also explain the observed wide energy range of repeating FRBs in a narrow bandwidth. |"

       "|**Abstract**| The dividing line between gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and ordinary stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is yet to be fully understood. Observationally mapping the variety of ejecta outcomes (ultra-relativistic, mildly-relativistic or non-relativistic) in SNe of Type Ic with broad lines (Ic-BL) can provide a key test to stellar explosion models. However, this requires large samples of the rare Ic-BL events with follow-up observations in the radio, where fast ejecta can be probed largely free of geometry and viewing angle effects. Here, we present the results of a radio (and X-ray) follow-up campaign of 16 SNe Ic-BL detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Our radio campaign resulted in 4 counterpart detections and 12 deep upper limits. None of the events in our sample is as relativistic as SN 1998bw and we constrain the fraction of SN 1998bw-like explosions to $< 19\\%$ (3$\\sigma$ Gaussian equivalent), a factor of $\\approx 2$ smaller than previously established. We exclude relativistic ejecta with radio luminosity densities in between $\\approx 5\\times10^{27}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ and $\\approx 10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ at $t\\gtrsim 20$ d since explosion for $\\approx 60\\%$ of the events in our sample. This shows that SNe Ic-BL similar to the GRB-associated SN 1998bw, SN 2003lw, SN 2010dh, or to the relativistic SN 2009bb and iPTF17cw, are rare. Our results also exclude an association of the SNe Ic-BL in our sample with largely off-axis GRBs with energies $E\\gtrsim 10^{50}$ erg. The parameter space of SN2006aj-like events (faint and fast-peaking radio emission) is, on the other hand, left largely unconstrained and systematically exploring it represents a promising line of future research. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| Several recent simulations of galaxy formation predict two main phases of supermassive black hole (BH) accretion: an early, highly intermittent phase (during which BHs are under-massive relative to local scaling relations), followed by a phase of accelerated growth. We investigate physical factors that drive the transition in BH accretion in cosmological zoom-in simulations from the FIRE project, ranging from dwarf galaxies to galaxies sufficiently massive to host luminous quasars. The simulations model multi-channel stellar feedback, but neglect AGN feedback. We show that multiple physical properties, including halo mass, galaxy stellar mass, and depth of the central gravitational potential correlate with accelerated BH fueling: constant thresholds in these properties are typically crossed within ~0.1 Hubble time of accelerated BH fueling. Black hole masses increase sharply when the stellar surface density in the inner 1 kpc crosses a threshold Sigma1 ~ 10^9.5 Msun/kpc^2, a characteristic value above which gravity prevents stellar feedback from ejecting gas, and similar to the value above which galaxies are observed to quench. We further show that accelerated BH growth correlates with the emergence of long-lived, thin gas disks, as well as with virialization of the inner circumgalactic medium. The halo mass Mh ~ 10^12 Msun and stellar mass Mstar ~ 10^10.5 Msun at which BH growth accelerates correspond to ~L* galaxies. The fact that stellar feedback becomes inefficient at ejecting gas from the nucleus above this mass scale may play an important role in explaining why AGN feedback appears to be most important in galaxies above ~L*. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| We present the Spectroscopic Classification of Astronomical Transients (SCAT) survey, which is dedicated to spectrophotometric observations of transient objects such as supernovae and tidal disruption events. SCAT uses the SuperNova Integral-Field Spectrograph (SNIFS) on the University of Hawai'i 2.2-meter (UH2.2m) telescope. SNIFS was designed specifically for accurate transient spectrophotometry, including absolute flux calibration and host-galaxy removal. We describe the data reduction and calibration pipeline including spectral extraction, telluric correction, atmospheric characterization, nightly photometricity, and spectrophotometric precision. We achieve $\\lesssim 5\\%$ spectrophotometry across the full optical wavelength range ($3500-9000~\\r{A}$) under photometric conditions. The inclusion of photometry from the SNIFS multi-filter mosaic imager allows for decent spectrophotometric calibration ($10-20\\%$) even under unfavorable weather/atmospheric conditions. SCAT obtained $\\approx 650$ spectra of transients over the first 3 years of operations, including supernovae of all types, active galactic nuclei, cataclysmic variables, and rare transients such as superluminous supernovae and tidal disruption events. These observations will provide the community with benchmark spectrophotometry to constrain the next generation of hydrodynamic and radiative transfer models. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| Galaxies in the local Universe are thought to require ongoing replenishment of their gas reservoir in order to maintain the observed star formation rates. Cosmological simulations predict that such accretion can occur in both a dynamically hot and cold mode. However, until now observational evidence of the accretion required to match the observed star formation histories is lacking. This paper attempts to determine whether galaxies in the local Universe possess a significant reservoir of HI and what would be the accretion rates derived from such reservoirs. We search the vicinity of 22 nearby galaxies for isolated HI clouds or distinct streams in a systematic and automated manner. The HALOGAS observations represent one of the most sensitive and detailed HI surveys to date. These observations typically reach column density sensitivities of 10^19 cm^-2 over a 20 km/s width. We find 14 secure HI cloud candidates without an observed optical counterpart. These cloud candidates appear to be analogues to the most massive clouds detected around the Milky Way and M31. However, on average their numbers seem significantly reduced. We constrain upper limits for HI accretion in the local Universe. The average HI mass currently observed amounts to a rate of 0.05 Msun/yr with a stringent upper limit of 0.22 Msun/yr, confirming previous estimates. This is much lower than the average star formation rate in this sample. Our best estimate, based on GBT detection limits of several galaxies, suggests that another 0.04 Msun/yr could be accreted from undetected clouds and streams. These results show that in nearby galaxies HI is not being accreted at the same rate as stars are currently being formed. Our study can not exclude that other forms of gas accretion are at work. However, these observations also do not reveal extended neutral gas reservoirs around most nearby spiral galaxies. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| We study the impact of neutral hydrogen absorption on ${\\rm H_2}$ photodissociation in protogalactic haloes exposed to soft-UV radiation. Lyman-series absorption can significantly deplete dissociating photons as line overlap with the ${\\rm H_2}$ Lyman-Werner bands occurs for neutral column densities exceeding $10^{22}$ ${\\rm cm^{-2}}$, but this effect has not been previously included in studies of protogalactic haloes. We use high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to investigate this \"HI-shielding\" in three metal-free atomic cooling haloes collapsing at redshift $z \\sim 10-20$. We use CLOUDY modeling to update a previous fitting formula for HI-shielding which is a better model for shielding of non-ground state ${\\rm H_2}$ rovibrational populations and implement the new fit in our simulations. We find that the inclusion of HI-shielding increases the \"critical flux\" for suppression of ${\\rm H_2}$ cooling in these haloes by $\\sim 60-100$ per cent. The larger critical flux has implications in particular for the predicted numbers of candidate haloes in which \"direct collapse\" could seed massive ($\\sim 10^5$ ${\\rm M_\\odot}$) black holes at $z \\sim 15$. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| More and more experiments have identified that the energy spectra of both primary and secondary cosmic-rays exhibit a hardening above $\\sim 200$ GV. Most recently, the DAMPE experiment has reported a hardening of boron-to-carbon ratio at $200$ GV. These signs call for modifications of the conventional cosmic-ray (CR) picture. In this work, we propose that the plethoric secondary cosmic rays, for example, boron, antiprotons, originate from the hadronic interactions of freshly accelerated cosmic rays with the interstellar gas near the sources. We find that secondary-to-primary ratios, for example, boron-to-carbon, boron-to-oxygen and antiproton-to-proton ratios, could be well described. The measurements of electrons and positrons could also be accounted for. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| We present a search for continuous gravitational wave signals from an unidentified pulsar potentially powering HESS J1427-608, a spatially-unresolved TeV point source detected by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S). The search uses a semi-coherent algorithm, which combines the maximum likelihood $\\mathcal{F}-$statistic with a hidden Markov Model to efficiently detect and track quasi-monochromatic signals that wander randomly in frequency. It uses data from the second observing run of the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. Multi-wavelength observations of the H.E.S.S. source are combined with the proprieties of the population of TeV-bright pulsar wind nebulae to constrain the search parameters. We find no evidence of gravitational-wave emission from this target. We set upper limits on the characteristic wave strain $h_0^{95\\%}$ (for circularly-polarised signals) at $95\\%$ confidence level in sample sub-bands and interpolate it to estimate the sensitivity in the full band. We find $h_0^{95\\%} = 1.3\\times 10^{-25}$ near 185~Hz. The implied constraints on the ellipticity and r-mode amplitude reach $\\epsilon\\leq 10^{-5}$ and $\\alpha \\leq 10^{-3}$ at 200~Hz, respectively. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| We present early science results from Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO), an HI survey using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). Using ASKAP sub-arrays available during its commissioning phase, DINGO early science data were taken over $\\sim$ 60 deg$^{2}$ of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) 23 h region with 35.5 hr integration time. We make direct detections of six known and one new sources at $z < 0.01$. Using HI spectral stacking, we investigate the HI gas content of galaxies at $0.04 < z< 0.09$ for different galaxy colours. The results show that galaxy morphology based on optical colour is strongly linked to HI gas properties. To examine environmental impacts on the HI gas content of galaxies, three sub-samples are made based on the GAMA group catalogue. The average HI mass of group central galaxies is larger than those of satellite and isolated galaxies, but with a lower HI gas fraction. We derive a variety of HI scaling relations for physical properties of our sample, including stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, $NUV-r$ colour, specific star formation rate, and halo mass. We find that the derived HI scaling relations are comparable to other published results, with consistent trends also observed to $\\sim$0.5 dex lower limits in stellar mass and stellar surface density. The cosmic HI densities derived from our data are consistent with other published values at similar redshifts. DINGO early science highlights the power of HI spectral stacking techniques with ASKAP. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| The atmosphere is one of the most important contamination sources in the ground-based Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. In this paper, we study three kinds of filters, which are polynomial filter, high-pass filter, and Wiener filter, to investigate their ability for removing atmospheric noise, as well as their impact on the data analysis process through the end-to-end simulations of CMB experiment. We track their performance by analyzing the response of different components of the data, including both signals and noise. In the time domain, the calculation shows that the high-pass filter has the smallest root mean square error and can achieve high filtering efficiency, followed by the Wiener filter and polynomial filter. We then perform map-making with the filtered time ordered data (TOD) to trace the effects from filters on the map domain, and the results show that the polynomial filter gives high noise residual at low frequency, which gives rise to serious leakage to small scales in map domain during the map-making process, while the high-pass filter and Wiener filter do not have such significant leakage. Then we estimate the angular power spectra of residual noise, as well as those of the input signal for comparing the filter effects in the power spectra domain. Finally, we estimate the standard deviation of the filter corrected power spectra to compare the effects from different filters, and the results show that, at low noise level, the three filters give almost comparable standard deviations on the medium and small scales, but at high noise level, the standard deviation of the polynomial filter is significantly larger. These studies can be used for the reduction of atmospheric noise in future ground-based CMB data processing. |\n",

We report the discovery of a second transiting planet (LTT 1445A c) and a third non-transiting candidate planet (LTT 1445A d) with orbital periods of 3.12 and 24.30 days, respectively. The host star is the main component of a triple M-dwarf system at a distance of 6.9 pc. We used 84 ESPRESSO high-resolution spectra to determine accurate masses of 2.3$\\pm$0.3 $\\mathrm{M}_\\oplus$ and 1.0$\\pm$0.2 $\\mathrm{M}_\\oplus$ for planets b and c and a minimum mass of 2.7$\\pm$0.7 $\\mathrm{M}_\\oplus$ for planet d. Based on its radius of 1.43$\\pm0.09$ $\\mathrm{R}_\\oplus$ as derived from the TESS observations, LTT 1445A b has a lower density than the Earth and may therefore hold a sizeable atmosphere, which makes it a prime target for the James Webb Space Telescope. We used a Bayesian inference approach with the nested sampling algorithm and a set of models to test the robustness of the retrieved physical values of the system. There is a probability of 85$\\%$ that the transit of planet c is grazing, which results in a retrieved radius with large uncertainties at 1.60$^{+0.67}_{-0.34}$ $\\mathrm{R}_\\oplus$. LTT 1445A d orbits the inner boundary of the habitable zone of its host star and could be a prime target for the James Webb Space Telescope. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| Standard sirens -- gravitational wave (GW) sources with an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart -- can be used to measure the Hubble constant directly which should help to ease the existing Hubble tension. However, if the source is moving, a relativistic redshift affects the redshift of the EM counterpart and the apparent distance of the GW source, and thus it needs to be corrected to obtain accurate measurements. We study the effect of velocity on GWs for a source in an expanding universe showing that the total redshift of the wave is equal to the product of the relativistic redshift and the cosmological redshift. We, further, find that a motion of the source changes its apparent distance by a factor $(1+z_{\\rm rel})^2$ in contrast to a linear factor for the cosmological redshift. We discuss that the additional factor for the relativistic redshift is a consequence of a velocity-dependent amplitude for GWs. We consider the effect of the velocity on the chirp mass and the apparent distance of the source an observer would infer when ignoring the velocity. We find that for different astrophysical scenarios the error in the chirp mass can range between 0.1\\,\\% and 7\\,\\% while the error in the apparent distance can be between 0.25\\,\\% and 15\\,\\%. Furthermore, we consider the error introduced in the measurement of the Hubble constant using standard sirens for two cases: (i) when the effect of velocity on the redshift of the EM counterpart is considered but not on the apparent distance obtained from GWs and (ii) when the effect of the velocity is ignored completely. We find that in the first case the error can reach 1\\,\\% for a source moving due to the peculiar velocity of its host galaxy and that in the second case the error can be more than 5\\,\\% for a source at the distance of GW150914 with the same velocity. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| Studies of solar twins have key impacts on the astronomical community, but only $\\sim$100--200 nearby solar twins ($<$ 1 kpc) have been reliably identified over the last few decades. The aim of our survey (SDST) is to identify $\\sim$150--200 distant solar twins and analogues (up to $\\lesssim$ 4 kpc) closer to the Galactic Centre. We took advantage of the precise Gaia and Skymapper surveys to select Sun-like candidates in a 2-degree field, which were observed with the HERMES spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. We successfully built up the required signal-to-noise ratio (25-per-pixel in the HERMES red band) for most targets as faint as Gaia G of 17.4 mag. The stellar photometric/astrometric parameters (e.g., \\teff, \\logg, mass) of our candidates are derived in this paper, while the spectroscopic parameters will be presented in the third paper in this SDST series. The selection success rate - the fraction of targets which belong to solar twins or analogues - was estimated from simulated survey data and the Besan\\c{c}on stellar population model, and compared with the actual success rate of the survey. We find that expected and actual success rates agree well, indicating that the numbers of solar twins and analogues we discover in SDST are consistent with expectations, affirming the survey approach. These distant solar analogues are prime targets for testing for any variation in the strength of electromagnetism in regions of higher dark matter density, and can make additional contributions to our understanding of, e.g., Galactic chemical evolution in the inner Milky Way. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| In the study of radiation mechanisms of AGNs' jets, hadronuclear (pp) interactions are commonly neglected, because the number density of cold protons in the jet is considered insufficient. Very recently, our previous work proves that pp interactions in the low TeV luminosity AGNs, which have potential to generate detectable very-high-energy (VHE) emission, could be important. Based on this, the one-zone pp model is employed to study low-state quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distributions of a sample of low TeV luminosity AGNs in this work. Our modeling results show that the gamma-ray generated in pp interactions can explain the observed TeV spectra and has contribution to higher energy band that could be detected by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). In the sample, we suggest that M 87, Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 are the most likely objects to be detected by LHAASO in the near future. Other possible origins of VHE emission are also briefly discussed. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| Turbulent plasma motion is common in the universe, and invoked in solar flares to drive effective acceleration leading to high energy electrons. Unresolved mass motions are frequently detected in flares from extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations, which are often regarded as turbulence. However, how this plasma turbulence forms during the flare is still largely a mystery. Here we successfully reproduce observed turbulence in our 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulation where the magnetic reconnection process is included. The turbulence forms as a result of an intricate non-linear interaction between the reconnection outflows and the magnetic arcades below the reconnection site, in which the shear-flow driven Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI) plays a key role for generating turbulent vortices. The turbulence is produced above high density flare loops, and then propagates to chromospheric footpoints along the magnetic field as Alfvenic perturbations. High turbulent velocities above 200 km s^-1 can be found around the termination shock, while the low atmosphere reaches turbulent velocities of 10 km s^-1 at a layer where the number density is about 10^11 cm^-3. The turbulent region with maximum non-thermal velocity coincides with the region where the observed high-energy electrons are concentrated, demonstrating the potential role of turbulence in acceleration. Synthetic views in EUV and fitted Hinode-EIS spectra show excellent agreement with observational results. An energy analysis demonstrates that more than 10% of the reconnection downflow kinetic energy can be converted to turbulent energy via KHI. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| Recent studies have revealed a strong relation between sample-averaged black-hole (BH) accretion rate (BHAR) and star formation rate (SFR) among bulge-dominated galaxies, i.e., \"lockstep\" BH-bulge growth, in the distant universe. This relation might be closely related to the BH-bulge mass correlation observed in the local universe. To understand further BH-bulge coevolution, we present ALMA CO(2-1) or CO(3-2) observations of 7 star-forming bulge-dominated galaxies at z=0.5-2.5. Using the ALMA data, we detect significant ($>3\\sigma$) CO emission from 4 objects. For our sample of 7 galaxies, we measure (or constrain with upper limits) their CO line fluxes and estimate molecular gas masses ($M_{gas}$). We also estimate their stellar masses ($M_{star}$) and SFRs by modelling their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Using these physical properties, we derive the gas-depletion timescales ($t_{dep} = M_{gas}/SFR$) and compare them with the bulge/BH growth timescales ($t_{grow} = M_{star}/SFR \\sim M_{BH}/BHAR$). Our sample generally has $t_{dep}$ shorter than $t_{grow}$ by a median factor of $\\gtrsim 4$, indicating that the cold gas will be depleted before significant bulge/BH growth takes place. This result suggests that the BH-bulge lockstep growth is mainly responsible for maintaining their mass relation, not creating it. We note that our sample is small and limited to $z<2.5$; JWST and ALMA will be able to probe to higher redshifts in the near future. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| A significant number of stellar binary black hole (sBBH) mergers may be lensed and detected by the third generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors. Their lensed host galaxies may be detectable, which thus helps to accurately localize these sources and provide a new approach to study the origin of sBBHs. In this paper, we investigate the detectability of the lensed host galaxies for the lensed sBBH mergers. We find that the detection fraction of the host galaxies to the lensed GW events can be significantly different for a survey with a given limiting magnitude if sBBHs are produced by different mechanisms, such as the evolution of massive binary stars, the dynamical interactions in dense star clusters, and that assisted by active galactic nuclei or massive black holes. Furthermore, we illustrate that the statistical spatial distribution of those lensed sBBHs in its hosts resulting from different sBBH formation channels can be different from each other. Therefore, with the third generation GW detectors and future large scale galaxy surveys, it is possible to independently constrain the sBBH origin via the detection fraction of those lensed events with identifiable lensing host signatures and/or even constrain the contribution fractions from different sBBH formation mechanisms |\n",

On average the analysis for each object is based on 270 data points during 80 days in at least 3 bands. All the young low-mass stars in our sample show periodic photometric variations. We determine spot temperatures and coverage by comparing the measured photometric amplitudes in optical bands with simulated amplitudes based on atmosphere models, including a complete error propagation. 21 objects in our sample feature cool spots, with spot temperatures 500 - 2500 K below the stellar effective temperature ($T_{\\rm eff}$), and a coverage of 0.05 - 0.4. Six more have hot spots, with temperatures up to 3000 K above $T_{\\rm eff}$ and coverage below 0.15. The remaining four stars have ambiguous solutions or are AA Tau-type contaminants. All of the stars with large spots (i.e. high coverage $>0.1$) are relatively cool with $T_{\\rm eff} < 4500$ K, which could be a result of having deeper convection zones. Apart from that, spot properties show no significant trends with rotation period, infrared excess, or stellar properties. Most notably, we find hot spots in stars that do not show $K-W2$ infrared excess, indicating the possibility of accretion across an inner disk cavity or the presence of plage. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| During the inspiralling of a white dwarf (WD) into an intermediate-mass black hole (~10^{2-5} M_sun), both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic (EM) radiation are emitted. Once the eccentric orbit's pericenter radius approaches the tidal radius, the WD would be tidally stripped upon each pericenter passage. The accretion of these stripped mass would produce EM radiation. It is suspected that the recently discovered new types of transients, namely the quasi-periodic eruptions and the fast ultraluminous X-ray bursts, might originate from such systems. Modeling these flares requires a prediction of the amount of stripped mass from the WD and the details of the mass supply to the accretion disk. We run hydrodynamical simulations to study the orbital parameter dependence of the stripped mass. We find that our results match the analytical estimate that the stripped mass is proportional to a 5/2-th power of the excess depth by which the WD overfills its instantaneous Roche lobe at the pericenter. The corresponding fallback rate of the stripped mass is calculated, which may be useful in interpreting the individual flaring light curve in candidate EM sources. We further calculate the long-term mass-loss evolution of a WD during its inspiral and the detectability of the GW and EM signals. The EM signal from the mass-loss stage can be easily detected: the limiting distance is ~320(M_h/10^4 M_sun) Mpc for Einstein Probe. The GW signal, for the space-borne detectors such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna or TianQin, can be detected only within the Local Supercluster (~33 Mpc). |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| Parity violation is expected to generate an asymmetry between the amplitude of left and right-handed gravitational-wave modes which leads to a circularly polarized stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB). Due to the three independent baselines in the LIGO-Virgo network, we focus on the amplitude difference in strain power characterized by Stokes' parameters and do maximum-likelihood estimation to constrain the polarization degree of SGWB. Our results indicate that there is no evidence for the circularly polarized SGWB in the data. Furthermore, by modeling the SGWB as a power-law spectrum, we place upper limit on the normalized energy density $\\Omega_\\text{gw}(25\\,\\text{Hz})<5.3\\times10^{-9}$ at $95\\%$ confidence level after marginalizing over the polarization degree and spectral index. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| We report the discovery of one possible neutron star binary ($P_{\\rm orb} =$ 0.8666 day) by using the LAMOST low-resolution spectroscopic data. The visible companion is a late A-type dwarf ($T_{\\rm eff} = 7900 \\pm 200$ K; log$g$ $=$ 4.3$\\pm$0.2; $M =$ 1.7$\\pm$0.1 M$_{\\odot}$; $R\\ =\\ 1.7\\pm0.2$ R$_{\\odot}$), at a distance of 1.11$\\pm0.03$ kpc. No double-lined feature can be seen from the GTC/HORuS high-resolution spectra, thus the radial velocity variation indicates an invisible object hiding in the binary. The system's optical light curves show clear ellipsoidal variability, suggesting that the visible companion is tidal distorted. By fitting the multi-band light curves with the ELC and WD codes, we constrain the mass of the invisible star to be 1.1--1.3 M$_{\\odot}$. Spectral disentangling shows no additional component with optical absorption spectra, supporting the system contains one compact object. No X-ray or UV emission are detected in the ROSAT archive observations. Therefore, we suspect the invisible object is more likely a neutron star rather than a white dwarf. Our finding suggests the ability of LAMOST spectroscopic survey to discover X-ray quiescent compact objects. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| High-redshift observations are often biased towards massive and bright galaxies that are not necessarily representative of the full population. In order to accurately study galaxy evolution and mass assembly at these redshifts, observations of ``normal'' main sequence galaxies are required. Here we present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) 0.3\" resolution observations of the [CII] emission line at 158$\\mu$m of HZ7, a main sequence galaxy at $z=5.25$. Comparing to archival rest-frame UV observations taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we find strong evidence of the existence of extended [CII] emission, which we estimate to be twice the size of the rest-frame UV emission, yielding one of the first high-redshift objects where a clear signature of a [CII] ``Halo'' has been detected to date. For a matched S\\'ersic profile with n = 1, we measured a [CII] effective radius of $0.50\\pm 0.04$\" (3.07$\\pm 0.25$ kpc) and an average rest-frame UV effective radius of $0.2\\pm0.04$\" ($1.48\\pm0.16$ kpc). The [CII] morphology and kinematics of the system suggest a merging event resulting in a non rotating disk system. This event could be responsible for the extended [CII] emission. Alternatively, some potential obscured emission could also explain the [CII] to UV size ratio. These results contribute to the growing consensus with respect to the existence of extended [CII] emission around galaxies. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| The burst mode of accretion in massive star formation is a scenario linking the initial gravitational collapse of parent pre-stellar cores to the properties of their gravitationally unstable discs and of their accretion-driven bursts. In this study, we present a series of high-resolution 3D radiation-hydrodynamics numerical simulations for young massive stars formed out of collapsing 100 Mo molecular cores spinning with several values of the ratio of rotational-to-gravitational energies beta=5%-9%. The models include the indirect gravitational potential caused by disc asymmetries. We find that this modifies the barycenter of the disc, causing significant excursions of the central star position, which we term stellar wobbling. The stellar wobbling slows down and protracts the development of gravitational instability in the disc, reducing the number and magnitude of the accretion-driven bursts undergone by the young massive stars, whose properties are in good agreement with that of the burst monitored from the massive protostar M17 MIR. Including stellar wobbling is therefore important for accurate modeling disc structures. Synthetic ALMA interferometric images in the millimeter waveband show that the outcomes of efficient gravitational instability such as spiral arms and gaseous clumps can be detected for as long as the disc is old enough and has already entered the burst mode of accretion. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| With the increasing number of planets discovered by TESS, the atmospheric characterization of small exoplanets is accelerating. L98-59 is a M-dwarf hosting a multi-planet system, and so far, four small planets have been confirmed. The innermost planet b is $\\sim15\\%$ smaller and $\\sim60\\%$ lighter than Earth, and should thus have a predominantly rocky composition. The Hubble Space Telescope observed five primary transits of L98-59b in $1.1-1.7\\ \\mu$m, and here we report the data analysis and the resulting transmission spectrum of the planet. We measure the transit depths for each of the five transits and, by combination, we obtain a transmission spectrum with an overall precision of $\\sim20$ ppm in for each of the 18 spectrophotometric channels. With this level of precision, the transmission spectrum does not show significant modulation, and is thus consistent with a planet without any atmosphere or a planet having an atmosphere and high-altitude clouds or haze. The scenarios involving an aerosol-free, H$_2$-dominated atmosphere with H$_2$O or CH$_4$ are inconsistent with the data. The transmission spectrum also disfavors, but does not rules out, an H$_2$O-dominated atmosphere without clouds. A spectral retrieval process suggests that an H$_2$-dominated atmosphere with HCN and clouds or haze may be the preferred solution, but this indication is non-conclusive. Future James Webb Space Telescope observations may find out the nature of the planet among the remaining viable scenarios. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| Dust extinction is one of the most reliable tracers of the gas distribution in the Milky Way. The near-infrared (NIR) Vista Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey enables extinction mapping based on stellar photometry over a large area in the Galactic plane. We devise a novel extinction mapping approach, XPNICER, by bringing together VVV photometric catalogs, stellar parameter data from StarHorse catalogs, and previously published Xpercentile and PNICER extinction mapping techniques. We apply the approach to the VVV survey area, resulting in an extinction map that covers the Galactic disk between 295 and 350 degrees at longitude and -2 to 2 degrees at latitude, and the Galactic bulge between -10 and 5 degrees at latitude. The map has 30 arcseconds spatial resolution and it traces extinctions typically up to about 10-20 mag of visual extinction and maximally up to Av~30 mag. We compare our map to previous dust based maps, concluding that it provides a high-fidelity extinction-based map, especially in its ability to recover both the diffuse dust component of the Galaxy and moderately extincted giant molecular cloud regions. The map is especially useful as independent, extinction-based data on the Galactic dust distribution and applicable for a wide range of studies from individual molecular clouds to the studies of the Galactic stellar populations. |\n",

       "$In recent years, the study of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been greatly advanced by the progress in the observations.$\n",
       "$New detections of the galactic events \\citep{CHIME2020Naturmagnetar,Bochenek2020Natur}, burst polarisation \\citep[e.g.][]{Michilli2018,Luo2020Natur}, burst morphology \\citep[e.g.][]{Pleunis2021ApJ}, source periodicity \\citep[e.g.][]{Chime2020NaturPeriod,Pastor-Marazuela2021Natur,CHIME2022Natur}, source activity \\citep[e.g.][]{Li2021Natur} and host galaxies \\citep[e.g.][]{Bassa2017ApJL,Bhandari2022AJ}, have led to constraints on both progenitor models and radiation mechanisms.$\n",
       "$However, a complete theoretical understanding of fast radio bursts is still not available and requires more effort \\citep[see][for recent reviews]{Zhang2020Natur,Xiao2021SCPMA}.$\n",
       "$Highly magnetised compact objects are usually involved as the central engine of FRBs, such as magnetars, pulsars, and accreting black holes. Among them, the magnetar scenario has been confirmed by the detection of the galactic event \\citep{CHIME2020Naturmagnetar,Bochenek2020Natur,Li2021NatAs,Mereghetti2020ApJL,Ridnaia2021NatAs,Tavani2021NatAs}.$\n",
       "$Theoretically, the energy resource can come from the internal magnetic energy of magnetars \\citep[e.g.][]{Popov2013,Katz2016,Beloborodov2017,Margalit2020ApJL} or the gravitational potential energy when a companion star is involved \\citep[e.g.][]{Wang2016,Dai2016,Wang2018,Zhang2020ApJL,Dai2020ApJL,Most2022MNRAS}.$\n",
       "$Currently, the mainstream FRB radiation mechanisms can be divided into two categories: the near-field (or close-in) and the far-field (or far-away) model.$\n",
       "$The near-field model, mainly based on the coherent curvature radiation model near the magnetar surface \\citep[e.g.][]{Kumar2017,Yang2018,Lu2020MNRAS,WangFY2020ApJ,Yang2020ApJL,WangWY2020ApJ}, can explain the complex temporal behavior of FRBs, while the bunching mechanism for the coherent curvature radiation is unclear.$\n",
       "$The far-field model incorporates the synchrotron maser emission at the shock front far from the magnetosphere as the coherent radio emission mechanism  \\citep[e.g.][]{Lyubarsky2014,Beloborodov2017,Margalit2018,Waxman2017,Metzger2019MNRAS,Beloborodov2020ApJ,Plotnikov2019,Margalit2020ApJL,Wu2020ApJL,Xiao2020ApJL}.$\n",
       "$This mechanism has been demonstrated using kinetic plasma simulations \\citep[e.g.][]{Plotnikov2019,Sironi2021PhRvL}.$\n",
       "$However, it is difficult to explain the sub-second scale quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) from FRBs \\citep{CHIME2022Natur,Pastor-Marazuela2022arXiv}.$\n",
       "$It is also found that neither model can fully explain the X-ray/radio event from SGR 1935+2154 \\citep{Wang2020ApJ}.$\n",
       "$Recently, a new type of FRB model is proposed where an FRB is radiated as fast-magnetosonic (FMS) waves generated from violent magnetic reconnection triggered by a low-frequency pulse (LFP) compressing the current sheet \\citep{Lyubarsky2020ApJ}.$\n",
       "$As the coherent radio emission is produced near the light cylinder, we refer to it as the \"intermediate-field\" model.$\n",
       "$Kinetic plasma simulations \\citep{Philippov2019,Mahlmann2022ApJL} have successfully demonstrated the emission of coherent FMS waves through this mechanism.$\n",
       "$It is also found that the high linear polarisation \\citep{Lyubarsky2020ApJ} and the downward frequency drifting \\citep{Mahlmann2022ApJL} can be well explained.$\n",
       "$However, the predicted frequency is significantly lower than the observation of the SGR 1935+2154 event \\citep{Wang2020ApJ}.$\n",
       "$In this paper, we revisit the intermediate-field model and propose that the LFP is produced through nonlinear conversion of Alfv\\'en waves, which further leads to the generation of QPOs.$\n",
       "$In section \\ref{sec:radiation_injection}, we briefly review the coherent radiation mechanism from magnetic reconnection.$\n",
       "$In section \\ref{sec:FRB_QPO}, we study the injection of energy through Alfv\\'en waves, the wave dynamics in the magnetosphere, and the generation of FRBs and QPOs.$\n",
       "$In section \\ref{sec:explainQPO}, we apply our model to observations.$\n",
       "$The conclusion and discussion are presented in section \\ref{sec:conclusion}.$\n",

       "$Magnetic reconnection is a process of changing the magnetic topology when two oppositely directed magnetic field lines approach each other forming a current sheet at the centre.$\n",
       "$The onset of magnetic reconnection is triggered when the current sheet becomes tearing or kink unstable and breaks into a self-similar chain of plasmoids extending down to the kinetic scale \\citep{Uzdensky2010PhRvL}.$\n",

       "$In this paper we revisited the intermediate-field FRB model and studied the QPOs.$\n",
       "$The launch of Alfv\\'en waves into the magnetosphere generates an LFP, which is made up of FMS waves at approximately the same frequencies of Alfv\\'en waves (\\fa).$\n",
       "$This further generates FRBs when the LFP dissipates its energy at the current sheet near the light cylinder.$\n",
       "$The FRB light curve is thus modulated by the frequency of the LFP, exhibiting QPOs at a frequency \\sim\\fa.$\n",
       "$The major difference of our calculations from \\cite{Lyubarsky2020ApJ} is the treatment of magnetic field configurations of the LFP and the magnetar wind, as we considered the wave dynamics in the magnetosphere.$\n",
       "$The FRB frequency (Eq. \\ref{eq:nu_final}), the single pulse width (Eq. \\ref{eq:tpulse}), and luminosity (Eq. \\ref{eq:lfrb}) depend mainly on the magnetar's period and magnetic field and the quake energetics and QPO frequency.$\n",
       "$For the dynamics in the magnetosphere and the compressed striped wind, numerical simulations \\citep{Yu2020,Yuan2022ApJ,Mahlmann2022ApJL} have improved the understanding of the related parameters.$\n",
       "$Therefore, the major uncertainties mainly come from two quake energetic parameters (\\epsilon and \\zeta), which requires further studies for a better understanding.$\n",
       "$With physically reasonable values for these two parameters, we find that this model can naturally and self-consistently interpret the observed frequency, pulse width, luminosity and QPO signal of the radio/X-ray event from SGR 1935+2154 and FRB 20191221A.$\n",
       "$Our model can also naturally explain the observed wide energy span detected in a relative narrow frequency band, such as the broad energy range (4\\times10^{36}-8\\times10^{39} erg) observed in FRB 121102 at 1.25 GHz \\citep{Li2021Natur}, as the frequency does not depend on the flare energy apparently.$\n",
       "$And in certain parameter space for young magnetars, the frequency is in the optical band, indicating the possibility of producing fast optical transients.$\n",
       "$In general, QPOs will modulate the FRB light curve. Direct identification of QPOs may require at least around ten individual pulses (n_A\\gtrsim10) in one event \\citep[e.g.][]{CHIME2022Natur}.$\n",
       "$For the high-frequency QPOs (\\fa\\gtrsim1 kHz), the corresponding FRB pulses may overlap with each other, making it difficult to identify from the data.$\n",
       "$While for the low-frequency QPOs (\\fa\\sim10 Hz), one may only expect to detect them from magnetars with P\\gtrsim10/\\fa\\sim1 s so that the QPO signal is not contaminated by the magnetar spin.$\n",
       "$For repeating FRBs, QPOs would affect the waiting time distribution even if only several pulses are presented in the observed individual events.$\n",
       "$The peak at 3.4 ms in the waiting time distribution of FRB 121102 may be such a case \\citep{Li2021Natur}.$\n",
       "$As only a small portion of energy is dissipated to power FRBs, the majority of the energy will be dissipated into X-rays or carried by the ejecta.$\n",
       "$The ejecta would further power an afterglow or a nebula \\citep[e.g.][]{Waxman2017,Beloborodov2017,Margalit2018,WangLai2020}.$\n",
       "$As magnetar flares may eject a large fraction of mass \\citep[e.g.][]{Granot2006ApJ}, high-energy cosmic rays can also be produced in such afterglows/nebulae.$\n",
       "$Besides, such a magnetic reconnection process could also take place in neutron star mergers \\citep[e.g.][]{Wang2018,Most2022MNRAS} and accreting black holes \\citep[e.g.][]{Beloborodov2017ApJ,Sridhar2021MNRAS}, thus we might also expect such reconnection driven transients from neutron star mergers, X-ray binaries, or active galactic nuclei.$\n",

       "$However, a complete theoretical understanding of fast radio bursts is still not available and requires more effort \\citep[see][for recent reviews]{Zhang2020Natur,Xiao2021SCPMA}.$\n",
       "$Highly magnetised compact objects are usually involved as the central engine of FRBs, such as magnetars, pulsars, and accreting black holes.

       "$Theoretically, the energy resource can come from the internal magnetic energy of magnetars \\citep[e.g.][]{Popov2013,Katz2016,Beloborodov2017,Margalit2020ApJL} or the gravitational potential energy when a companion star is involved \\citep[e.g.][]{Wang2016,Dai2016,Wang2018,Zhang2020ApJL,Dai2020ApJL,Most2022MNRAS}.$\n",
       "$Currently, the mainstream FRB radiation mechanisms can be divided into two categories: the near-field (or close-in) and the far-field (or far-away) model.$\n",
       "$The near-field model, mainly based on the coherent curvature radiation model near the magnetar surface \\citep[e.g.][]{Kumar2017,Yang2018,Lu2020MNRAS,WangFY2020ApJ,Yang2020ApJL,WangWY2020ApJ}, can explain the complex temporal behavior of FRBs, while the bunching mechanism for the coherent curvature radiation is unclear.$\n",

       "$In this paper we revisited the intermediate-field FRB model and studied the QPOs.$\n",
       "$The launch of Alfv\\'en waves into the magnetosphere generates an LFP, which is made up of FMS waves at approximately the same frequencies of Alfv\\'en waves ($\\fa$).$\n",
       "$This further generates FRBs when the LFP dissipates its energy at the current sheet near the light cylinder.$\n",
       "$The FRB light curve is thus modulated by the frequency of the LFP, exhibiting QPOs at a frequency \\sim$\\fa$.$\n",
       "$The major difference of our calculations from \\cite{Lyubarsky2020ApJ} is the treatment of magnetic field configurations of the LFP and the magnetar wind, as we considered the wave dynamics in the magnetosphere.$\n",
       "$The FRB frequency (Eq. \\ref{eq:nu_final}), the single pulse width (Eq. \\ref{eq:tpulse}), and luminosity (Eq. \\ref{eq:lfrb}) depend mainly on the magnetar's period and magnetic field and the quake energetics and QPO frequency.$\n",
       "$For the dynamics in the magnetosphere and the compressed striped wind, numerical simulations \\citep{Yu2020,Yuan2022ApJ,Mahlmann2022ApJL} have improved the understanding of the related parameters.$\n",
       "$Therefore, the major uncertainties mainly come from two quake energetic parameters (\\epsilon and \\zeta), which requires further studies for a better understanding.$\n",
       "$With physically reasonable values for these two parameters, we find that this model can naturally and self-consistently interpret the observed frequency, pulse width, luminosity and QPO signal of the radio/X-ray event from SGR 1935+2154 and FRB 20191221A.$\n",
       "$Our model can also naturally explain the observed wide energy span detected in a relative narrow frequency band, such as the broad energy range (4\\times10^{36}-8\\times10^{39} erg) observed in FRB 121102 at 1.25 GHz \\citep{Li2021Natur}, as the frequency does not depend on the flare energy apparently.$\n",
       "$And in certain parameter space for young magnetars, the frequency is in the optical band, indicating the possibility of producing fast optical transients.$\n",
       "$In general, QPOs will modulate the FRB light curve. Direct identification of QPOs may require at least around ten individual pulses (n_A\\gtrsim10) in one event \\citep[e.g.][]{CHIME2022Natur}.$\n",
       "$For the high-frequency QPOs ($\\fa$\\gtrsim1 kHz), the corresponding FRB pulses may overlap with each other, making it difficult to identify from the data.$\n",
       "$While for the low-frequency QPOs ($\\fa$\\sim10 Hz), one may only expect to detect them from magnetars with P\\gtrsim10/$\\fa$\\sim1 s so that the QPO signal is not contaminated by the magnetar spin.$\n",
       "$For repeating FRBs, QPOs would affect the waiting time distribution even if only several pulses are presented in the observed individual events.$\n",
       "$The peak at 3.4 ms in the waiting time distribution of FRB 121102 may be such a case \\citep{Li2021Natur}.$\n",
       "$As only a small portion of energy is dissipated to power FRBs, the majority of the energy will be dissipated into X-rays or carried by the ejecta.$\n",
       "$The ejecta would further power an afterglow or a nebula \\citep[e.g.][]{Waxman2017,Beloborodov2017,Margalit2018,WangLai2020}.$\n",
       "$As magnetar flares may eject a large fraction of mass \\citep[e.g.][]{Granot2006ApJ}, high-energy cosmic rays can also be produced in such afterglows/nebulae.$\n",
       "$Besides, such a magnetic reconnection process could also take place in neutron star mergers \\citep[e.g.][]{Wang2018,Most2022MNRAS} and accreting black holes \\citep[e.g.][]{Beloborodov2017ApJ,Sridhar2021MNRAS}, thus we might also expect such reconnection driven transients from neutron star mergers, X-ray binaries, or active galactic nuclei.$\n",

       "**Abstract:** Quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signals are discovered in some fast radio bursts (FRBs) such as FRB 20191221A, as well as in the X-ray burst associated with the galactic FRB from SGR 1935+2154.We revisit the intermediate-field FRB model where the radio waves are generated as fast-magnetosonic waves through magnetic reconnection near the light cylinder.The current sheet in the magnetar wind is compressed by a low frequency pulse emitted from the inner magnetosphere to trigger magnetic reconnection.By incorporating the wave dynamics of the magnetosphere, we demonstrate how the FRB frequency, the single pulse width, and luminosity are determined by the period, magnetic field, QPO frequency and quake energetics of the magnetar.We find that this model can naturally and self-consistently interpret the X-ray/radio event from SGR 1935+2154 and the QPO in FRB 20191221A.It can also explain the observed wide energy range of repeating FRBs in a narrow bandwidth.\n",
