       "|**Abstract**| We present rest-frame optical spectra from Keck/MOSFIRE and Keck/NIRES of 16 candidate ultramassive galaxies targeted as part of the Massive Ancient Galaxies at $z>3$ Near-Infrared (MAGAZ3NE) Survey. These candidates were selected to have photometric redshifts $3\\lesssim z_{\\rm phot}<4$, photometric stellar masses log($M$/M$_\\odot$)$>11.7$, and well-sampled photometric spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the UltraVISTA and VIDEO surveys. In contrast to previous spectroscopic observations of blue star-forming and post-starburst ultramassive galaxies, candidates in this sample have very red SEDs implying significant dust attenuation, old stellar ages, and/or active galactic nuclei (AGN). Of these galaxies, eight are revealed to be heavily dust-obscured $2.0<z<2.7$ galaxies with strong emission lines, some showing broad features indicative of AGN, three are Type I AGN hosts at $z>3$, one is a $z\\sim1.2$ dusty galaxy, and four galaxies do not have a confirmed spectroscopic redshift. In fact, none of the sample has |$z_{\\rm spec}-z_{\\rm phot}$|$<0.5$, suggesting difficulties for photometric redshift programs in fitting similarly red SEDs. The prevalence of these red interloper galaxies suggests that the number densities of high-mass galaxies are overestimated at $z\\gtrsim3$ in large photometric surveys, helping to resolve the `impossibly early galaxy problem' and leading to much better agreement with cosmological galaxy simulations. A more complete spectroscopic survey of ultramassive galaxies is required to pin down the uncertainties on their number densities in the early universe. |"

       "|**Abstract**| We carried out very deep VLT/SPHERE imaging polarimetry of the nearby system Eps Eri based on 38.5 hours of integration time with a 600 - 900 nm broadband filter to search for polarized scattered light from a planet or from circumstellar dust using AO, coronagraphy, high precision differential polarimetry, and angular differential imaging. We have improved several data reduction and post-processing techniques and also developed new ones to further increase the sensitivity of SPHERE/ZIMPOL. The data provide unprecedented contrast limits, but no significant detection of a point source or an extended signal from circumstellar dust. For each observing epoch, we obtained a point source contrast for the polarized intensity between $2\\cdot 10^{-8}$ and $4\\cdot 10^{-8}$ at the expected separation of the planet Eps Eri b of 1'' near quadrature phase. The polarimetric contrast limits are about six to 50 times better than the intensity limits because polarimetric imaging is much more efficient in speckle suppression. Combining the entire 14-month data set to the search for a planet moving on a Keplerian orbit with the K-Stacker software further improves the contrast limits by a factor of about two, to about $8 \\cdot 10^{-9}$ at 1''. This would allow the detection of a planet with a radius of about 2.5 Jupiter radii. The surface brightness contrast limits achieved for the polarized intensity from an extended scattering region are about 15 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ at 1'', or up to 3 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ deeper than previous limits. For Eps Eri, these limits exclude the presence of a narrow dust ring and they constrain the dust properties. This study shows that the polarimetric contrast limits for reflecting planets with SPHERE/ZIMPOL can be improved to a level $<10^{-8}$ simply by collecting more data over many nights and using the K-Stacker software. |"

       "|**Abstract**| In this work, we explore the capability of future gravitational wave (GW) standard siren observations to constrain the total neutrino mass in some typical interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We examine the combined potential of the third-generation ground-based GW detector network and a short $\\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) detector similar to the THESEUS telescope for cosmological analysis. Our findings suggest that future GW standard siren observations could modestly refine the upper limit on the total neutrino mass, enhancing it by $5\\%$ to $10\\%$ over the existing limit given by the CMB+BAO+SN data. Additionally, the future observations are expected to significantly improve the constraints on $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and $H_0$. Moreover, the measurements could enhance the precision of the coupling strength $\\beta$ by $23\\%$ to $42\\%$. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| Numerical simulations indicate that correlations exist between the velocity distributions of stars and dark matter (DM). We study the local DM velocity distribution based on these correlations. We select K giants from LAMOST DR8 cross-matched with Gaia DR3, which has robust measurements of three-dimensional velocity and metallicity, and separate them into the disk, halo substructure and main halo components in the chemo-dynamical space utilizing the Gaussian Mixture Model. The substructure component is highly radially anisotropic, and possibly related to the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) merger event, while the halo component is isotropic and accreted from the earliest mergers following the Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution (Standard Halo Model, SHM). We find that the GES-like substructure contributes $\\sim85\\%$ of the local non-disk stars in the Solar neighbourhood, which is nearly invariant when applying different volume cuts or additional angular momentum constraints. Utilizing the metallicity-stellar-mass relation and the stellar-mass-halo-mass relation, we find that $\\sim25_{-15}^{+24}\\%$ of local DM is in the kinematic substructure. Combined with the stellar distributions of non-disk components, we compute the velocity distribution of local DM. The modified heliocentric velocity distribution of local DM shifts to a lower speed and has a sharper peak compared to the SHM, which yields updated detection limits for the DM direct detection experiments. Our work confirms that the local DM velocity distribution deviates from the SHM, and needs to be properly accounted in the DM detection experiments. |\n",

       "$We present rest-frame optical spectra from Keck/MOSFIRE and Keck/NIRES of 16 candidate ultramassive galaxies targeted as part of the Massive Ancient Galaxies at z>3 Near-Infrared (MAGAZ3NE) Survey.$\n",
       "$These candidates were selected to have photometric redshifts \\mbox{3\\lesssim~\\zphot~<4}, photometric stellar masses \\mbox{\\logM~>11.7}, and well-sampled photometric spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the \\mbox{UltraVISTA} and VIDEO surveys.$\n",
       "$In contrast to previous spectroscopic observations of blue star-forming and post-starburst ultramassive galaxies, candidates in this sample have very red SEDs$\n",
       "$implying significant dust attenuation, old stellar ages, and/or active galactic nuclei (AGN).$\n",
       "$Of these galaxies, eight are revealed to be heavily dust-obscured 2.0<z<2.7 galaxies with strong emission lines, some showing broad features indicative of AGN, three are Type I AGN hosts at z>3, one is a z\\sim1.2 dusty galaxy, and four galaxies do not have a confirmed spectroscopic redshift.$\n",
       "$In fact, none of the sample has \\mbox{\\lvert~\\zspec-\\zphot~\\rvert <0.5}, suggesting difficulties for photometric redshift programs in fitting similarly red SEDs.$\n",
       "$The prevalence of these red interloper galaxies suggests that the number densities of high-mass galaxies are overestimated at z\\gtrsim3 in large photometric surveys, helping to resolve the `impossibly early galaxy problem' and leading to much better agreement with cosmological galaxy simulations.$\n",
       "$A more complete spectroscopic survey of ultramassive galaxies is required to pin down the uncertainties on their number densities in the early universe.$\n",
       "$\\end{abstract}$\n",
       "$\\section{Introduction}$\n",
       "$Measuring the change in number density of galaxies versus stellar mass as a function of cosmic time news insights into the build-up of stellar mass and, when considering star-forming and quiescent galaxies separately, the timescales over which galaxies quench their star formation.$\n",
       "$This galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) has therefore become a standard tool for studying galaxy evolution.$\n",
       "$The GSMF has been measured using optical surveys across a range of redshifts from the local Universe \\citep[\\eg][]{Cole2001, Bell2003} out to z\\sim1.5 \\citep[\\eg][]{Bundy2006, Borch2006}.$\n",
       "$At these redshifts, the evolution of the GSMF appears to be small.$\n",
       "$The most massive galaxies are already in place and are typically only growing via minor mergers (\\ie slowly), while star formation rates in less massive galaxies are lower than at earlier epochs \\citep[\\eg][]{Kawinwanichakij2020a}.$\n",
       "$Wide and deep near-infrared imaging surveys have allowed for GSMF analyses out to considerably higher redshifts and have also probed down to lower stellar masses \\citep[\\eg][]{Marchesini2009, Muzzin2013, Ilbert2013, Tomczak2014, Stefanon2015, Davidzon2017, Sherman2020a, McLeod2020, Marsan2022, Weaver2023a}.$\n",
       "$These studies have shown that the GSMF evolves substantially in the first 4 Gyr as galaxies form new stars rapidly and the first galaxies begin quenching.$\n",
       "$Intriguingly, the number densities of the most massive galaxies (\\logM~\\gtrsim11.5) do not appear to change much, if at all, after this early epoch \\citep{Marchesini2010, Kawinwanichakij2020a}, implying that nearly all of these objects which exist today have built the majority of their stellar mass in the first \\sim3~Gyr of cosmic time and then ceased stellar mass growth almost completely.$\n",
       "$The number densities of these massive galaxies at high redshifts are significantly higher than those predicted by most simulations, and$\n",
       "$are close to, if not in excess of, the limits of hierarchical galaxy assembly and \\LambdaCDM \\citep[\\eg][]{Antwi-Danso2023, Glazebrook2023}.$\n",
       "$This has been termed the `impossibly early galaxy problem' \\citep{Steinhardt2016}, though extremely efficient star-formation in early, massive halos \\citep[\\eg][]{Stefanon2021a, Weaver2023a} or a varying initial mass function \\citep[\\eg][]{vanDokkum2012, Mendel2020} may help resolve the issue.$\n",
       "$Spectroscopic confirmation of these most massive galaxies at early times with accurate measurements of their stellar mass is required to understand whether changes to the current paradigm of galaxy evolution are necessary.$\n",
       "$In the last decade, samples of ultra-massive galaxies (UMGs; \\logM~\\gtrsim11) at 3<z<4 have been confirmed with optical/near-infrared spectroscopy to the point where there can be no doubt that such galaxies exist in substantial numbers \\citep[\\eg][]{Marsan2015, Glazebrook2017, Schreiber2018b, Tanaka2019, Valentino2020, Forrest2020a, Forrest2020b, Saracco2020, Antwi-Danso2023}.$\n",
       "$Several have also been spectroscopically confirmed with longer wavelength observations \\citep[\\eg][]{Faisst2020, Jones2021}.$\n",
       "$Importantly however, the difficulty of confirming these objects means that the brightest candidates are typically selected for spectroscopic followup.$\n",
       "$This biases the sample toward confirmation of blue star-forming and post-starburst galaxies at these epochs, which have rest-frame V-band magnitudes \\sim10\\times higher than older quiescent galaxies with similar stellar masses \\citep[\\eg][]{Bruzual2003}.$\n",
       "$Additionally, none of these UMGs confirmed with optical/near-infrared spectroscopy are highly dust-obscured galaxies, which photometric surveys suggest contribute significantly to the population of high-mass galaxies at these redshifts \\citep[\\eg][]{Martis2016, Marsan2022, Long2023}, though see also \\citet{Dunlop2007}.$\n",
       "$Such galaxies are extremely difficult to confirm spectroscopically in the optical/near-infrared even using the largest ground-based telescopes as dust obscuration reduces the strength of emission lines and absorption features in the rest-frame optical typically used for confirmation.$\n",
       "$We have undertaken an ambitious campaign to spectroscopically confirm candidate dust-obscured UMGs with \\logM~>11.7 and z>3 (herein termed super-ultramassive galaxies; \\sumg s) with Keck/MOSFIRE \\citep{McLean2010, McLean2012}.$\n",
       "$In this work we describe the photometric sample, target selection, spectroscopic observations, and data reduction in Section~\\ref{Sec:Data}, and analysis of the spectroscopy in Section~\\ref{Sec:AnSpec}.$\n",
       "$This is followed by a comparison of \\sumg candidate objects in the COSMOS field from different catalogs in Section~\\ref{Sec:AnComp} and discussion of their number densities in Section~\\ref{Sec:Disc}.$\n",
       "$Throughout this work we assume a \\LambdaCDM cosmology with H_0=70~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}, \\Omega_M=0.3, and \\Omega_\\Lambda=0.7.$\n",
       "$We also adopt the AB magnitude system \\citep{Oke1983}.$\n",
       "$\\section{Data} \\label{Sec:Data}$\n",
       "$\\subsection{Photometric Catalogs}$\n",
       "$This work builds on previous observations from the MAGAZ3NE survey, which spectroscopically confirmed the largest sample to date of UMGs at 3<z<4 using Keck/MOSFIRE \\citep{Forrest2020b}.$\n",
       "$Previous targets were almost entirely either blue star-forming or post-starburst galaxies and showed excellent agreement between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts and stellar masses.$\n",
       "$This population also showed large velocity dispersions \\citep{Forrest2022} and the residence of at least some of the UMGs in confirmed overdense structures \\citep[][\\textcolor{cyan}{McConachie et al. 2024, submitted}]{Shen2021, McConachie2022}.$\n",
       "$In this work we target a sample which is considerably redder in color and contains the most massive candidate galaxies at z>3.$\n",
       "$As in previous MAGAZ3NE papers, we select targets for spectroscopic follow-up from wide and deep near-infrared selected photometric catalogs.$\n",
       "$Two catalogs in the COSMOS field \\citep{Scoville2007} based on deep near-infrared Y-, J-, H-, and K_s-band data from the UltraVISTA survey \\citep{McCracken2012} are considered.$\n",
       "$The first catalog \\citep{Muzzin2013a} uses the UltraVISTA data release 1 over 1.62~deg^2 in addition to ground-based optical data \\citep[Subaru/SuprimeCam and CFHT/MegaCam;][]{Taniguchi2007, Capak2007} and space-based ultraviolet \\citep[GALEX;][]{Martin2005} and near-infrared \\citep[Spitzer/ IRAC and Spitzer/MIPS;][]{Sanders2007} data.$\n",
       "$Photometry is based on a K_s-band detection image with a 90\\% completeness of K_s=23.4~mag and 30 photometric bandpasses.$\n",
       "$The second catalog \\citep[][A. Muzzin, private communication]{Marsan2022} is based on UltraVISTA data release 3, which includes deeper observations (K_s=24.5~mag) in strips totaling 0.84~deg^2.$\n",
       "$Additional observations from Spitzer/IRAC \\citep{Mehta2018, Caputi2017, Ashby2018} increased the depth in the 3.6~\\mum and 4.5~\\mum bands by >1~mag, while additional data from Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam \\citep{Aihara2019}, CFHTLS-Deep, and the NEWFIRM Medium Band Survey \\citep{Whitaker2011} were also added for up to 49 photometric bandpasses per object.$\n",
       "$Two catalogs based on Z-, Y-, J-, H-, and K_s-band imaging from the VISTA VIDEO survey \\citep{Jarvis2013} are also used (M. Annunziatella, private communication).$\n",
       "$These catalogs, one in the \\textit{XMM}-LSS (XMM) field and one in the \\textit{Chandra} Deep Field South (CDFS), were constructed following a similar process to the UltraVISTA catalogs.$\n",
       "$The VIDEO observations were combined with observations from the Dark Energy Survey \\citep{Abbott2018}, CFHT-Deep/Wide Legacy Survey \\citep{Gwyn2012}, VOICE Survey \\citep{Vaccari2016}, and Hyper-SuprimeCam \\citep{Hayashi2018}.$\n",
       "$Deep IRAC observations from the SERVS \\citep{Mauduit2012} and DeepDrill \\citep{Lacy2021} surveys were also included for a total of 22 photometric bandpasses.$\n",
       "$The XMM catalog covers 5.1~deg^2 while the CDFS catalog covers 3.3~deg^2.$\n",
       "$Both have K_s-band detection images with 90\\% completeness limits of K_s\\sim23.0~mag.$\n",
       "$Galaxies in all catalogs have photometric redshift probability distributions from EaZY \\citep{Brammer2008} and stellar population properties derived using FAST \\citep{Kriek2009} assuming a \\citet{Chabrier2003} IMF.$\n",
       "$\\subsection{Target Selection}$\n",
       "$We apply a photometric stellar mass cut of \\logM~>11.7 and a photometric redshift cut of 3<~\\zphot~<4 to initially select galaxies in these catalogs.$\n",
       "$Each galaxy is visually inspected in an attempt to verify that it is a single object without contamination from a neighbor nearby in projection and that the best fit spectral energy distribution (SED) model is a reasonable fit to the photometry.$\n",
       "$While a magnitude cut was not explicitly made for target selection, brighter targets generally had better fit SEDs and were more likely to be observed.$\n",
       "$Only two observed candidates, both in COSMOS, had K-band magnitudes fainter than the cut of K_s<21.7 used in previous MAGAZ3NE works.$\n",
       "$This results in a sample of 34 high-quality targets of which 16 were spectroscopically observed - 8/16 in XMM, 4/8 in CDFS, and 4/10 in COSMOS.$\n",
       "$A comparison of the stellar masses and rest-frame colors from this sample and those targets from previous MAGAZ3NE work is shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:samp}, while the photometry and best-fit SED models for the galaxies in the COSMOS field are shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:phot} (XMM and CDFS targets are similarly displayed in the Appendix).$\n",
       "$\\subsection{Spectroscopy}$\n",
       "$\\subsubsection{Observations}$\n",
       "$Fifteen targets were followed-up using the MOSFIRE instrument on the Keck I telescope.$\n",
       "$These were initially targeted in the K-band, where the potentially strong \\OIII and \\Hbeta emission lines lie across 3<z<3.8.$\n",
       "$As with previous MAGAZ3NE follow-up, on-the-fly data reduction was performed to look for emission lines during the course of observations.$\n",
       "$If a redshift was considered confirmed, we moved on to the next target.$\n",
       "$As a result, the exposure times on each galaxy are non-uniform.$\n",
       "$When a target showed a single emission line in the K-band whose nature could not reliably be determined, or when only continuum was detected, we followed-up in H-band.$\n",
       "$We also targeted one \\sumg candidate (XMM-VID1-2433) with the NIRES instrument \\citep{JWilson2004} on Keck II.$\n",
       "$While NIRES is less sensitive than MOSFIRE in the K-band and targets a single object at a time, it has the advantage of obtaining data in the \\mbox{Y-, J-, H-,} and K-bandpasses simultaneously.$\n",
       "$The exposure times and conditions for \\sumg candidates are summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:obs2}.$\n",
       "$A more complete table of MAGAZ3NE targets is newd in the Appendix.$\n",
       "$\\subsubsection{Data Reduction}$\n",
       "$In contrast to previous MAGAZ3NE papers which used the Keck-supported Data Reduction Pipeline (DRP) to reduce the data, for this work we reduced the data using the MOSDEF 2D data reduction pipeline \\citep{Kriek2015,Kriek2024}.$\n",
       "$The main advantage of this reduction method over the DRP is the use of a bright star on a science slit to account for slight pointing offsets between exposures and weight individual frames by throughput and seeing, which results in a higher SNR 2D-spectrum.$\n",
       "$We also find a slightly more accurate accounting of spectral errors.$\n",
       "$Previous MAGAZ3NE MOSFIRE data, which were initially reduced using the MOSFIRE DRP, have been re-reduced using the MOSDEF pipeline as well.$\n",
       "$We note that in no case does this choice of reduction software significantly affect the redshift of an UMG in our sample.$\n",
       "$Data from Keck/NIRES were reduced using v1.14 of Pypeit \\citep{Prochaska2020} and a telluric correction was calculated using Molecfit \\citep{Smette2015, Kausch2015}.$\n",
       "$A custom Python code was used to perform optimal extraction of the targets \\citep{Horne1986}.$\n",
       "$When one or more emission lines were present, the shape of the optimal aperture was calculated around the strongest emission line.$\n",

       "$Indeed, in this work we also see significant line flux contribution in very red, massive galaxies.$\n",

       "$FAST++ has the advantage of allowing for flexible star formation history parameterizations and including both photometric and spectroscopic data, though models still do not include emission lines.$\n",
       "$We therefore perform a correction of the photometry due to observed emission features as in \\citet{Forrest2020b} with the line models described above and mask the emission line wavelengths in the spectra, but note that the possibility of other strong lines at spectrally unobserved wavelengths may additionally affect the modeling.$\n",

       "$While the masses of all \\sumg candidates with spectroscopic redshifts decrease from the photometric estimate largely due to their lower redshifts, the galaxies are certainly still very massive, with all but the z\\sim1.2 source having \\logM~>10.7.$\n",

       "$The four \\sumg candidates are detected in the COSMOS2015 and COSMOS2020 CLASSIC catalogs, while only two of them (COS-DR1-79837 and COS-DR1-209435) are detected in the COSMOS2020 FARMER catalog (COS-DR1-70455 and COS-DR1-233254 are not).$\n",

       "$While COS-DR1-79837 and COS-DR1-209435 have a range of \\Delta m_K\\lesssim0.1 mag between catalogs, COS-DR1-70455 and COS-DR1-233254 have ranges of \\Delta m_K=0.3 and 1.6 mag, respectively.$\n",
       "$This suggests that differences in accounting for flux from the nearby stars is contributing to variance in the extracted magnitudes, though in the case of the COS-DR1-233254 several somewhat close neighbors are visible in imaging which may also have been subsumed into the flux totals for the counterpart of this object in some catalogs - reproducing and analyzing this aspect of source detection is beyond the scope of this work.$\n",
       "$Both characterizations of COS-DR1-79837 and COS-DR1-209435 in the FARMER catalog yield significantly lower redshifts (and therefore lower stellar mass estimates) than the other parameterizations, and in the case of COS-DR1-209435, considerably lower than the \\zspec.$\n",
       "$While some off these objects have redshifts and stellar population parameters derived from the photometry which are similar to those derived once the redshift is fixed to the spectroscopic redshift, these values are more often discrepant, and no catalog produces consistently better agreement than the others.$\n",
       "$Given that in general the photometry for these objects is roughly consistent between catalogs, this suggests that the main difficulty with these objects is obtaining an accurate photometric redshift, which then propagates into determinations of stellar mass, etc.$\n",

       "$We report the number of these candidates which have a counterpart in at least one other catalog, and the number which have a counterpart in at least three other catalogs (out of the five considered).$\n",
       "$This removes the requirement of a target lying in the UltraVISTA DR3 footprint, which covers roughly half the area of the other catalogs.$\n",
       "$Similarly, we report the number of those counterparts which also have photometric redshifts and stellar masses satisfying either UMG or \\sumg cuts in at least one other stellar population characterization, and the number of counterparts satisfying these cuts in at least five other characterizations (out of the seven considered).$\n",
       "$Of all the UMG candidates, 96.9\\% have counterparts in at least one other catalog and 53.0\\% are characterized as UMGs in at least one other characterization.$\n",

       "$When UMG and \\sumg candidates from one characterization are not classified as such in another characterization, they generally have slightly lower photometric redshifts (2<z<3) and stellar masses (\\logM~>10.5), though the rest-frame UVJ colors are often quite red.$\n",
       "$Notably, the UltraVISTA DR1 EAZY template set did not contain templates as red as the COSMOS2020 eazy-py template set, limiting derived rest-frame colors to \\mbox{\\VJc~<2}.$\n",
       "$We note that for all of the \\sumg candidates spectroscopically observed, even in the most extreme cases of effects that can confound photometric redshift codes such as high dust attenuation and strong emission line contamination, all objects but one with spectroscopic redshifts still have \\logM~>10.7 and \\zspec~>2.$\n",

       "$We consider stellar mass inside a projected aperture of 30~kpc for FLAMINGO and within twice the half-stellar mass radius for TNG300, while stellar masses from GAEA are `total' stellar masses.$\n",

       "$Additionally, a stack of Keck/NIRES spectra of lower redshift galaxies with extreme dust obscuration and strong rest-frame optical emission lines \\citep[hot DOGs;][]{Finnerty2020} shows that such galaxies can have degenerate JWST NIRCam colors with red, high redshift galaxies \\citep{McKinney2023}.$\n",
       "$As a result, is is possible that such misidentifications from photometric data occur over a range of redshifts.$\n",
       "$Indeed, large numbers of candidate massive galaxies at surprisingly early times have been identified in JWST data, \\citep[\\eg][]{Naidu2022a, Naidu2022, Labbe2023, Barro2023, Kocevski2024}.$\n",
       "$A handful of these have been spectroscopically confirmed as early, massive galaxies \\citep[\\eg][]{Carnall2023, Haro2023a, Fujimoto2023}.$\n",
       "$However, populations of compact, red galaxies with significant AGN flux contributions have also been confirmed with JWST and longer wavelength data, some of which have significantly higher photometric redshifts than later confirmed \\citep[\\eg][]{Greene2023, Haro2023, Fujimoto2023a, Meyer2023, Kocevski2024}.$\n",
       "$Further JWST/NIRSpec follow-up of these candidates will shed light on the hypothesis that a significant fraction of red, massive high-redshift candidates are in fact lower redshift galaxies and/or less massive due to inaccurate photometric accounting of dust and AGN activity.$\n",

       "$Deep, multi-passband photometric catalogs point to the existence of a population of galaxies with redder colors and greater stellar masses than the most massive galaxies which have previously been spectroscopically confirmed at 3<z<4.$\n",
       "$In this work, the Massive Ancient Galaxies at z>3 Near-Infrared (MAGAZ3NE) Survey spectroscopically targeted 16 such galaxy candidates with \\zphot~\\gtrsim3 and \\logM~>11.7 (which we term \\sumg s) across three fields with some of the most extensive photometric data and high-quality photometric catalogs (UltraVISTA-COSMOS, VIDEO-CDFS, VIDEO-XMM).$\n",
       "$In sharp contrast to slightly lower mass galaxies from these same catalogs, which show excellent agreement between spectroscopic and photometric redshifts, none of the \\sumg candidates has a redshift \\mbox{\\lvert~\\zspec-\\zphot~\\rvert<0.5}.$\n",
       "$Three galaxies show broad emission lines at z>3 indicating Type I AGN contamination of the photometry biasing the photometric estimates of redshift and stellar mass.$\n",
       "$Half of the sample (9/16) are confirmed to be lower redshift interlopers at 2.0<z<2.7 (8 objects) and z\\sim1.2 (1 object) but are still very massive.$\n",
       "$The remaining four targets do not have confirmed spectroscopic redshifts.$\n",
       "$A comparison of catalogs in the COSMOS field suggests that none of the various construction methods or SED fitting methodologies used in these catalogs characterize the redshifts and stellar masses of these galaxies accurately.$\n",
       "$The underlying issue appears to be degeneracies among redshift, AGN contribution, and dust attenuation for objects with such red observed colors, which SED modeling templates have trouble disentangling.$\n",
       "$We use the results of our spectroscopic observations to revise the number density of \\sumg s seen in photometric surveys.$\n",
       "$This correction is a reduction by a factor of >4\\times (99\\% confidence) and likely >17\\times (68\\% confidence).$\n",
       "$A comparison to some of the newest and largest volume models shows that this reduction reduces the severity of the discrepancy between simulations and observations at 3<z<4.$\n",
       "$These misidentifications thus contribute substantially, and possibly entirely, to the discrepancy between observations and simulations in the number densities of the most massive galaxies at 3<z<4, reducing the observed apparent flattening in number densities at high redshifts for these very massive objects.$\n",
       "$The apparent failure of photometric redshift fitting codes to accurately identify these objects from fields with some of the most extensive and deepest photometry available suggests that improved optical and near-infrared photometry alone is unlikely to solve this problem over wide fields.$\n",
       "$While concentrated surveys with medium- and narrow-band photometry may reduce the severity of this issue, as could further imaging from facilities such as ALMA and JWST, spectroscopic campaigns targeting such objects are the only way to truly quantify the scale of this effect.$\n",

       "$We present rest-frame optical spectra from Keck/MOSFIRE and Keck/NIRES of 16 candidate ultramassive galaxies targeted as part of the Massive Ancient Galaxies at z>3 Near-Infrared (MAGAZ3NE) Survey.$\n",
       "$These candidates were selected to have photometric redshifts \\mbox{3\\lesssim~\\zphot~<4}, photometric stellar masses \\mbox{\\logM~>11.7}, and well-sampled photometric spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the \\mbox{UltraVISTA} and VIDEO surveys.$\n",

       "$implying significant dust attenuation, old stellar ages, and/or active galactic nuclei (AGN).$\n",
       "$Of these galaxies, eight are revealed to be heavily dust-obscured 2.0<z<2.7 galaxies with strong emission lines, some showing broad features indicative of AGN, three are Type I AGN hosts at z>3, one is a z\\sim1.2 dusty galaxy, and four galaxies do not have a confirmed spectroscopic redshift.$\n",
       "$In fact, none of the sample has \\mbox{\\lvert~\\zspec-\\zphot~\\rvert <0.5}, suggesting difficulties for photometric redshift programs in fitting similarly red SEDs.$\n",

       "$\\section{Introduction}$\n",
       "$Measuring the change in number density of galaxies versus stellar mass as a function of cosmic time news insights into the build-up of stellar mass and, when considering star-forming and quiescent galaxies separately, the timescales over which galaxies quench their star formation.$\n",
       "$This galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) has therefore become a standard tool for studying galaxy evolution.$\n",
       "$The GSMF has been measured using optical surveys across a range of redshifts from the local Universe \\citep[\\eg][]{Cole2001, Bell2003} out to z\\sim1.5 \\citep[\\eg][]{Bundy2006, Borch2006}.$\n",
       "$At these redshifts, the evolution of the GSMF appears to be small.$\n",
       "$The most massive galaxies are already in place and are typically only growing via minor mergers (\\ie slowly), while star formation rates in less massive galaxies are lower than at earlier epochs \\citep[\\eg][]{Kawinwanichakij2020a}.$\n",
       "$Wide and deep near-infrared imaging surveys have allowed for GSMF analyses out to considerably higher redshifts and have also probed down to lower stellar masses \\citep[\\eg][]{Marchesini2009, Muzzin2013, Ilbert2013, Tomczak2014, Stefanon2015, Davidzon2017, Sherman2020a, McLeod2020, Marsan2022, Weaver2023a}.$\n",
       "$These studies have shown that the GSMF evolves substantially in the first 4 Gyr as galaxies form new stars rapidly and the first galaxies begin quenching.$\n",
       "$Intriguingly, the number densities of the most massive galaxies (\\logM~\\gtrsim11.5) do not appear to change much, if at all, after this early epoch \\citep{Marchesini2010, Kawinwanichakij2020a}, implying that nearly all of these objects which exist today have built the majority of their stellar mass in the first \\sim3~Gyr of cosmic time and then ceased stellar mass growth almost completely.$\n",
       "$The number densities of these massive galaxies at high redshifts are significantly higher than those predicted by most simulations, and$\n",
       "$are close to, if not in excess of, the limits of hierarchical galaxy assembly and \\LambdaCDM \\citep[\\eg][]{Antwi-Danso2023, Glazebrook2023}.$\n",
       "$This has been termed the `impossibly early galaxy problem' \\citep{Steinhardt2016}, though extremely efficient star-formation in early, massive halos \\citep[\\eg][]{Stefanon2021a, Weaver2023a} or a varying initial mass function \\citep[\\eg][]{vanDokkum2012, Mendel2020} may help resolve the issue.$\n",
       "$Spectroscopic confirmation of these most massive galaxies at early times with accurate measurements of their stellar mass is required to understand whether changes to the current paradigm of galaxy evolution are necessary.$\n",
       "$In the last decade, samples of ultra-massive galaxies (UMGs; \\logM~\\gtrsim11) at 3<z<4 have been confirmed with optical/near-infrared spectroscopy to the point where there can be no doubt that such galaxies exist in substantial numbers \\citep[\\eg][]{Marsan2015, Glazebrook2017, Schreiber2018b, Tanaka2019, Valentino2020, Forrest2020a, Forrest2020b, Saracco2020, Antwi-Danso2023}.$\n",
       "$Several have also been spectroscopically confirmed with longer wavelength observations \\citep[\\eg][]{Faisst2020, Jones2021}.$\n",
       "$Importantly however, the difficulty of confirming these objects means that the brightest candidates are typically selected for spectroscopic followup.$\n",
       "$This biases the sample toward confirmation of blue star-forming and post-starburst galaxies at these epochs, which have rest-frame V-band magnitudes \\sim10\\times higher than older quiescent galaxies with similar stellar masses \\citep[\\eg][]{Bruzual2003}.$\n",
       "$Additionally, none of these UMGs confirmed with optical/near-infrared spectroscopy are highly dust-obscured galaxies, which photometric surveys suggest contribute significantly to the population of high-mass galaxies at these redshifts \\citep[\\eg][]{Martis2016, Marsan2022, Long2023}, though see also \\citet{Dunlop2007}.$\n",
       "$Such galaxies are extremely difficult to confirm spectroscopically in the optical/near-infrared even using the largest ground-based telescopes as dust obscuration reduces the strength of emission lines and absorption features in the rest-frame optical typically used for confirmation.$\n",

       "$When a target showed a single emission line in the K-band whose nature could not reliably be determined, or when only continuum was detected, we followed-up in H-band.$\n",
       "$We also targeted one \\sumg candidate (XMM-VID1-2433) with the NIRES instrument \\citep{JWilson2004} on Keck II.$\n",
       "$While NIRES is less sensitive than MOSFIRE in the K-band and targets a single object at a time, it has the advantage of obtaining data in the \\mbox{Y-, J-, H-,} and K-bandpasses simultaneously.$\n",

       "$The main advantage of this reduction method over the DRP is the use of a bright star on a science slit to account for slight pointing offsets between exposures and weight individual frames by throughput and seeing, which results in a higher SNR 2D-spectrum.$\n",
       "$We also find a slightly more accurate accounting of spectral errors.$\n",

       "$This implies that either the redshift of the galaxy is such that any strong emission lines fall out of the wavelength range to which the spectroscopic observations are sensitive, or that the galaxies do not have strong observable emission lines, either due to passive nature or high levels of dust-obscuration.$\n",

       "$Indeed, in this work we also see significant line flux contribution in very red, massive galaxies.$\n",

       "$FAST++ has the advantage of allowing for flexible star formation history parameterizations and including both photometric and spectroscopic data, though models still do not include emission lines.$\n",
       "$We therefore perform a correction of the photometry due to observed emission features as in \\citet{Forrest2020b} with the line models described above and mask the emission line wavelengths in the spectra, but note that the possibility of other strong lines at spectrally unobserved wavelengths may additionally affect the modeling.$\n",
       "$The percentage contribution of flux from emission lines in the K-band for the \\sumg candidate sample is 12.2\\pm3.5\\%.$\n",
       "$The best fit models overlaid on the observed photometry and spectra are shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:specfit} for the COSMOS targets (XMM and CDFS targets are similarly displayed in the Appendix).$\n",
       "$While the masses of all \\sumg candidates with spectroscopic redshifts decrease from the photometric estimate largely due to their lower redshifts, the galaxies are certainly still very massive, with all but the z\\sim1.2 source having \\logM~>10.7.$\n",

       "$The derived properties from these fits are given in Table~\\ref{tab:photspecprop} and Figure~\\ref{fig:propcomp}.$\n",
       "$Between their large amounts of dust and strong emission lines, the z\\sim2 objects in particular may be consistent with the hot dust-obscured galaxy (DOG) population \\citep{Eisenhardt2012, Wu2012, Finnerty2020}.$\n",
       "$Objects in that sample are identified from WISE colors, and often do not have extensive photometric observations similar to those in this work, which prevents a rigorous comparison of other parameters such as stellar mass or star formation rate.$\n",
       "$The broad lines seen in five of the spectra, including all three confirmed at z>3, indicate AGN activity.$\n",
       "$While the removal of this emission line flux from the photometry has reduced the stellar mass estimate, these galaxies all have stellar masses \\logM~>11.5, with CDFS-VID1-2420 having an incredible stellar mass of \\logM~\\sim11.9.$\n",
       "$However, while the emission line flux has been removed, the potential exists for significant AGN continuum flux contribution to the photometry, which could artificially inflate the stellar mass \\citep[\\eg][]{Furtak2023}.$\n",

       "$Also critical to accurate photometric redshifts and stellar masses is the modeling of strong emission lines from star formation and/or AGN \\citep[\\eg][]{Stark2013, Smit2014, Salmon2015, Forrest2017, Withers2023}.$\n",
       "$Particularly at higher redshifts, near-infrared photometry is required to probe redward of the \\Dfour feature and constrain the mass.$\n",
       "$Deep IRAC data has historically been necessary to avoid the potential of a single line in the K-band leading to overestimates in stellar mass.$\n",
       "$While the improved sensitivity and spatial resolution of JWST may eventually preclude the need for Spitzer data to constrain the near-infrared in some fields, JWST's smaller field of view means that deep IRAC data will still be a critical part of large area catalogs for the foreseeable future.$\n",
       "$The catalogs used for target selection in this work satisfy these requirements and show excellent agreement between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts for galaxy populations as a whole.$\n",
       "$Additionally, they have reported completeness limits (\\geq 80\\%) down to at least 1 magnitude fainter in K_s than the faintest target observed in this program, yet a significant fraction of the \\sumg candidates do not have redshifts and masses consistent with the photometric estimates.$\n",

       "$Briefly however, the UltraVISTA DR1 and UltraVISTA DR3 catalogs use \\texttt{SExtractor} \\citep{Bertin1996} on deep K-band images to identify sources and measure photometry and MOPHONGO \\citep{Labbe2006, Labbe2010} to deblend IRAC photometry based on the K-band image, assuming no color gradients from the K-band to the Spitzer bandpasses.$\n",

       "$In addition to many of the UMGs confirmed in \\citet{Forrest2020b}, four of the \\sumg candidates which were targeted spectroscopically are in the COSMOS field, and all were selected from the UltraVISTA DR1 catalog (they are covered by the ultra-deep stripes in the UltraVISTA DR3 catalog).$\n",
       "$We search for the counterparts of these objects in the COSMOS2015 and COSMOS2020 catalogs using a projected radius of 0.5\\arcsec and, in the case of multiple such matches, select the neighbor within that radius with the most similar K-band magnitude.$\n",
       "$The four \\sumg candidates are detected in the COSMOS2015 and COSMOS2020 CLASSIC catalogs, while only two of them (COS-DR1-79837 and COS-DR1-209435) are detected in the COSMOS2020 FARMER catalog (COS-DR1-70455 and COS-DR1-233254 are not).$\n",
       "$The associated derived properties for these objects in the various catalogs are given in Table~\\ref{tab:obscomp}.$\n",
       "$The FARMER catalog does not detect COS-DR1-70455 and COS-DR1-233254 due to their proximity to bright stars, the areas around which are masked more conservatively than in other catalogs.$\n",
       "$It is notable that these two objects show considerably more variance in their reported K_s-band magnitudes between catalogs.$\n",
       "$While COS-DR1-79837 and COS-DR1-209435 have a range of \\Delta m_K\\lesssim0.1 mag between catalogs, COS-DR1-70455 and COS-DR1-233254 have ranges of \\Delta m_K=0.3 and 1.6 mag, respectively.$\n",
       "$This suggests that differences in accounting for flux from the nearby stars is contributing to variance in the extracted magnitudes, though in the case of the COS-DR1-233254 several somewhat close neighbors are visible in imaging which may also have been subsumed into the flux totals for the counterpart of this object in some catalogs - reproducing and analyzing this aspect of source detection is beyond the scope of this work.$\n",
       "$Both characterizations of COS-DR1-79837 and COS-DR1-209435 in the FARMER catalog yield significantly lower redshifts (and therefore lower stellar mass estimates) than the other parameterizations, and in the case of COS-DR1-209435, considerably lower than the \\zspec.$\n",
       "$While some off these objects have redshifts and stellar population parameters derived from the photometry which are similar to those derived once the redshift is fixed to the spectroscopic redshift, these values are more often discrepant, and no catalog produces consistently better agreement than the others.$\n",

       "$Deep, multi-passband photometric catalogs point to the existence of a population of galaxies with redder colors and greater stellar masses than the most massive galaxies which have previously been spectroscopically confirmed at 3<z<4.$\n",
       "$In this work, the Massive Ancient Galaxies at z>3 Near-Infrared (MAGAZ3NE) Survey spectroscopically targeted 16 such galaxy candidates with \\zphot~\\gtrsim3 and \\logM~>11.7 (which we term \\sumg s) across three fields with some of the most extensive photometric data and high-quality photometric catalogs (UltraVISTA-COSMOS, VIDEO-CDFS, VIDEO-XMM).$\n",
       "$In sharp contrast to slightly lower mass galaxies from these same catalogs, which show excellent agreement between spectroscopic and photometric redshifts, none of the \\sumg candidates has a redshift \\mbox{\\lvert~\\zspec-\\zphot~\\rvert<0.5}.$\n",
       "$Three galaxies show broad emission lines at z>3 indicating Type I AGN contamination of the photometry biasing the photometric estimates of redshift and stellar mass.$\n",
       "$Half of the sample (9/16) are confirmed to be lower redshift interlopers at 2.0<z<2.7 (8 objects) and z\\sim1.2 (1 object) but are still very massive.$\n",
       "$The remaining four targets do not have confirmed spectroscopic redshifts.$\n",
       "$A comparison of catalogs in the COSMOS field suggests that none of the various construction methods or SED fitting methodologies used in these catalogs characterize the redshifts and stellar masses of these galaxies accurately.$\n",
       "$The underlying issue appears to be degeneracies among redshift, AGN contribution, and dust attenuation for objects with such red observed colors, which SED modeling templates have trouble disentangling.$\n",
       "$We use the results of our spectroscopic observations to revise the number density of \\sumg s seen in photometric surveys.$\n",
       "$This correction is a reduction by a factor of >4\\times (99\\% confidence) and likely >17\\times (68\\% confidence).$\n",
       "$A comparison to some of the newest and largest volume models shows that this reduction reduces the severity of the discrepancy between simulations and observations at 3<z<4.$\n",
       "$These misidentifications thus contribute substantially, and possibly entirely, to the discrepancy between observations and simulations in the number densities of the most massive galaxies at 3<z<4, reducing the observed apparent flattening in number densities at high redshifts for these very massive objects.$\n",
       "$The apparent failure of photometric redshift fitting codes to accurately identify these objects from fields with some of the most extensive and deepest photometry available suggests that improved optical and near-infrared photometry alone is unlikely to solve this problem over wide fields.$\n",
       "$While concentrated surveys with medium- and narrow-band photometry may reduce the severity of this issue, as could further imaging from facilities such as ALMA and JWST, spectroscopic campaigns targeting such objects are the only way to truly quantify the scale of this effect.$\n",

       "**Abstract:** We present rest-frame optical spectra from Keck/MOSFIRE and Keck/NIRES of 16 candidate ultramassive galaxies targeted as part of the Massive Ancient Galaxies at $z>3$ Near-Infrared (MAGAZ3NE) Survey.These candidates were selected to have photometric redshifts $\\mbox{$3\\lesssim$ \\zphot $<4$}$ , photometric stellar masses $\\mbox{\\logM $>11.7$}$ , and well-sampled photometric spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the $\\mbox{UltraVISTA}$ and VIDEO surveys.In contrast to previous spectroscopic observations of blue star-forming and post-starburst ultramassive galaxies, candidates in this sample have very red SEDsimplying significant dust attenuation, old stellar ages, and/or active galactic nuclei (AGN).Of these galaxies, eight are revealed to be heavily dust-obscured $2.0<z<2.7$ galaxies with strong emission lines, some showing broad features indicative of AGN, three are Type I AGN hosts at $z>3$ , one is a $z\\sim1.2$ dusty galaxy, and four galaxies do not have a confirmed spectroscopic redshift.In fact, none of the sample has $\\mbox{$\\lvert$ \\zspec-\\zphot $\\rvert <0.5$}$ , suggesting difficulties for photometric redshift programs in fitting similarly red SEDs.The prevalence of these red interloper galaxies suggests that the number densities of high-mass galaxies are overestimated at $z\\gtrsim3$ in large photometric surveys, helping to resolve the `impossibly early galaxy problem' and leading to much better agreement with cosmological galaxy simulations.A more complete spectroscopic survey of ultramassive galaxies is required to pin down the uncertainties on their number densities in the early universe.\n",

       "**Abstract:** Cold planets, including all habitable planets, produce only scattered light emission in the visual tonear-infrared wavelength range. For this reason it is highly desirable to adapt the technique for the direct imaging of reflected light from extra-solar planets. For the nearby system $\\epsilon$ Eri, we want to set much deeper detection limits forthe expected scattered radiation from the radial velocity planet candidate ( $\\approx 0.7 {\\rm M_{\\rm J}}$ ) and the warm dust using the VLT/SPHERE adaptive optics (AO) instrument with the ZIMPOL imaging polarimeter. We carried out very deep imaging polarimetryof $\\epsilon$ Eri based on 38.5 hours of integration time witha broad-band filter ( $\\lambda_{\\rm c}=735 {\\rm nm}$ ) for the search of the polarization signalfrom a planet or from circumstellar dustusing AO,coronagraphy, high precision differential polarimetry, and angular differential imaging. The data were collected during 12 nights within four epochs distributed over 14 months and we searched for a signalin the individual epochs. We also combined the full data set to achieve an even higher contrast limit  considering the Keplerian motion using the K-Stacker software.All data were also combined for the search of the scattering signalfrom extended dust clouds.We improved various data reduction and post-processing procedures and also developed new ones to enhance the sensitivity of SPHERE/ZIMPOL further. The final detection limits were quantified and we investigated the potential of SPHERE/ZIMPOL for deeper observations. The data of $\\epsilon$ Eridani provide unprecedented contrast limits but no significant detection of a point source or an extended signal from circumstellar dust. For each observing epoch, we achieved a $5 \\sigma_{\\mathcal{N}}$ point source contrast for the polarized intensity $C_{\\rm P}=Q_{\\rm \\phi}/I_\\star$ between $2\\cdot 10^{-8}$ and $4\\cdot 10^{-8}$ at a separation of $\\rho\\approx1\\arcsec$ , which is as expected for the proposed radial velocity planet at a quadrature phase. The polarimetric contrast limits are close to the photon noise limits for $\\rho>0.6\\arcsec$ or about six times to 50 times better than the intensity limits becausepolarimetric imaging is much more efficient for speckle suppression.Combining the data for the search of a planet moving on a Keplerian orbit with the K-Stacker technique improves the contrast limits further by about a factor of two, when compared to an epoch, to about $C_{\\rm P}=0.8 \\cdot 10^{-8}$ at $\\rho=1\\arcsec$ . This would allow the detection of a planet with aradius of about 2.5 ${\\rm R_{\\rm J}}$ . Should future astrometry provide strong constraints on the position of the planet, then a $3 \\sigma_{\\mathcal{N}}$ detection at $1\\arcsec$ with $C_{\\rm P}\\approx 5\\cdot 10^{-9}$ would be within reach of our data.The surface brightness contrast limits achieved for the polarized intensity from an extended scattering region is about $15 {\\rm mag} {\\rm arcsec}^{-2}$ at $1\\arcsec$ or up to $3 {\\rm mag} {\\rm arcsec}^{-2}$ deeper than previous limits. For $\\epsilon$ Eri, these limits exclude the presenceof a narrow dust ring and they constrain the dust properties.The photon statistics would allow deeper limits but wefind a very weak systematic noise pattern probably introduced bypolarimetric calibration errors. This $\\epsilon$ Eri study shows that the polarimetric contrast limitsfor reflecting planets with SPHERE/ZIMPOL can beimproved to a level below $C_{\\rm p}<10^{-8}$ by just collecting more dataduring many nights using software such as K-Stacker, which can combine all data considering the expected planet orbit.Contrast limits of $C_{\\rm p}\\approx 10^{-9}$ are within reach for $\\epsilon$ Eriif the search can be optimized for a planet with a well-known orbit. This limitis also attainable for other bright nearby stars, such as $\\alpha$ Cen or Sirius A. Such data also provide unprecedented sensitivity for the searchof extended polarized emission from warm circumstellar dust.\n",
