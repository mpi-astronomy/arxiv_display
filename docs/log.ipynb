We made spatially and velocity-resolved observations of the RCW~120 PDR and nearby molecular gas with CO(6-5) and 13CO(6-5) lines and distinguished a bright CO-emitting layer, which we related with the dense shocked molecular gas moving away from the ionizing star due to expansion of HII region. Simulating gas density and temperature, as well as brightness of several CO and C+ emission lines from the PDR, we found reasonable agreement with the observed values. Analysing gas kinematics, we revealed the large-scale shocked PDR and also several dense environments of embedded protostars and outflows. We observe the shocked layer as the most regular structure in the CO(6-5) map and in the velocity space, when the gas around YSOs is dispersed by the outflows. |"

       "|**Abstract**| Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) play a critical role in the reprocessing of stellar radiation and in balancing the heating and cooling processes in the interstellar medium (ISM), but appear to be destroyed in HII regions. However, the mechanisms driving their destruction are still not completely understood. Using PHANGS-JWST and PHANGS-MUSE observations, we investigate how the PAH fraction changes in about 1500 HII regions across four nearby star-forming galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 1365, NGC 7496, IC 5332). We find a strong anti-correlation between the PAH fraction and the ionization parameter (the ratio between the ionizing photon flux and the hydrogen density) of HII regions. This relation becomes steeper for more luminous HII regions. The metallicity of HII regions has only a minor impact on these results in our galaxy sample. We find that the PAH fraction decreases with the H$\\alpha$ equivalent width - a proxy for the age of the HII regions - although this trend is much weaker than the one identified using the ionization parameter. Our results are consistent with a scenario where hydrogen-ionizing UV radiation is the dominant source of PAH destruction in star-forming regions. |"

       "|**Abstract**| Large-scale bars can fuel galaxy centers with molecular gas, often leading to the development of dense ring-like structures where intense star formation occurs, forming a very different environment compared to galactic disks. We pair ~0.3\" (30pc) resolution new JWST/MIRI imaging with archival ALMA CO(2-1) mapping of the central ~5kpc of the nearby barred spiral galaxy NGC1365, to investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for this extreme star formation. The molecular gas morphology is resolved into two well-known bright bar lanes that surround a smooth dynamically cold gas disk (R_gal ~ 475pc) reminiscent of non-star-forming disks in early type galaxies and likely fed by gas inflow triggered by stellar feedback in the lanes. The lanes host a large number of JWST-identified massive young star clusters. We find some evidence for temporal star formation evolution along the ring. The complex kinematics in the gas lanes reveal strong streaming motions and may be consistent with convergence of gas streamlines expected there. Indeed, the extreme line-widths are found to be the result of inter-`cloud' motion between gas peaks; ScousePy decomposition reveals multiple components with line widths of <sigma_CO,scouse> ~ 19km/s and surface densities of <Sigma_H2,scouse> ~ 800M_sun/pc^2, similar to the properties observed throughout the rest of the central molecular gas structure. Tailored hydro-dynamical simulations exhibit many of the observed properties and imply that the observed structures are transient and highly time-variable. From our study of NGC1365, we conclude that it is predominantly the high gas inflow triggered by the bar that is setting the star formation in its CMZ. |"

       "|**Abstract**| Among the most central open questions on the initial mass function (IMF) of stars is the impact of the environment on the shape of the core mass function (CMF) and thus potentially on the IMF. The ALMA-IMF Large Program aims to investigate the variations of the core distributions with cloud characteristics, as diagnostic observables of the formation process and evolution. The present study focuses on the W43-MM2&MM3 mini-starburst, whose CMF has been recently found to be top-heavy with respect to the Salpeter slope. W43-MM2&MM3 is a useful test case for environmental studies because it harbors a rich cluster containing a statistically significant number of cores, previously characterized in paper III. We applied a multiscale decomposition technique on the ALMA 1.3 mm and 3 mm continuum images to define six subregions. For each subregion we characterize the high column density probability distribution function, n-PDF, shape of the cloud gas using the 1.3 mm image. Using the core catalog, we investigate correlations between the CMF, n-PDF and core mass segregation. We classify the subregions into different stages of evolution, from quiescent to burst to post-burst, based on the surface number density of cores, number of outflows, and UCHii presence. The high-mass end of the subregion CMFs vary from being close to the Salpeter slope (quiescent) to top-heavy (burst and post-burst). Moreover, the second tail of the n-PDF varies from steep, to flat like observed for the high mass star-forming clouds. We found that subregions with flat second n-PDF tails display top-heavy CMFs. The CMF may evolve from Salpeter to top-heavy throughout the star formation process from the quiescent to the burst phase. This scenario raises the question of if the CMF might revert again to Salpeter as the cloud approaches the end of its star formation stage, a hypothesis that remains to be tested. |"

Measurements of brightness and areas in both ALMA and SDO/AIA images were conducted for CBPs within CHs and quiet Sun regions outside CHs. A statistical analysis of the measured physical properties resulted in a lower average CBP brightness in both ALMA and SDO/AIA data for CBPs within the CHs. Depending on the CBP sample size, the difference in intensity for the SDO/AIA data, and brightness temperature for the ALMA data, between the CBPs inside and outside CHs ranged from between 2$\\sigma$ and 4.5$\\sigma$, showing a statistically significant difference between those two CBP groups. For CBP areas, CBPs within the CH boundaries showed smaller areas on average, with the observed difference between the two CBP groups between 1$\\sigma$ and 2$\\sigma$ for the SDO/AIA data, and up to 3.5$\\sigma$ for the ALMA data, indicating that CBP areas are also significantly different. Given the measured properties, we conclude that the CBPs inside CHs tend to be less bright on average, but also smaller in comparison to those outside of CHs. This conclusion might point to the specific physical conditions and properties of the local CH region around a CBP limiting the maximum achievable intensity (temperature) and size of a CBP. |"

       "|**Abstract**| We compare embedded young massive star clusters (YMCs) to (sub-)millimeter line observations tracing the excitation and dissociation of molecular gas in the starburst ring of NGC 1365. This galaxy hosts one of the strongest nuclear starbursts and richest populations of YMCs within 20 Mpc. Here we combine near-/mid-IR PHANGS-JWST imaging with new ALMA multi-J CO (1-0, 2-1 and 4-3) and [CI](1-0) mapping, which we use to trace CO excitation via R42 = I_CO(4-3)/I_CO(2-1) and R21 = I_CO(2-1)/I_CO(1-0) and dissociation via RCICO = I_[CI](1-0)/I_CO(2-1) at 330 pc resolution. We find that the gas flowing into the starburst ring from northeast to southwest appears strongly affected by stellar feedback, showing decreased excitation (lower R42) and increased signatures of dissociation (higher RCICO) in the downstream regions. There, radiative transfer modeling suggests that the molecular gas density decreases and temperature and [CI/CO] abundance ratio increase. We compare R42 and RCICO with local conditions across the regions and find that both correlate with near-IR 2 um emission tracing the YMCs and with both PAH (11.3 um) and dust continuum (21 um) emission. In general, RCICO exhibits ~ 0.1 dex tighter correlations than R42, suggesting CI to be a more sensitive tracer of changing physical conditions in the NGC 1365 starburst than CO (4-3). Our results are consistent with a scenario where gas flows into the two arm regions along the bar, becomes condensed/shocked, forms YMCs, and then these YMCs heat and dissociate the gas. |"

       "|**Abstract**| We present new neutral atomic carbon [CI](3P1-3P0) mapping observations within the inner ~7 kpc and ~4 kpc of the disks of NGC3627 and NGC4321 at a spatial resolution of 190 pc and 270 pc, respectively, using the ALMA Atacama Compact Array (ACA). We combine these with the CO(2-1) data from PHANGS-ALMA, and literature [CI] and CO data for two other starburst and/or active galactic nucleus (AGN) galaxies (NGC1808, NGC7469), to study: a) the spatial distributions of CI and CO emission; b) the observed line ratio RCICO = I_[CI](1-0)/I_CO(2-1) as a function of various galactic properties; and c) the abundance ratio of [CI/CO]. We find excellent spatial correspondence between CI and CO emission and nearly uniform RCICO ~0.1 across the majority of the star-forming disks of NGC3627 and NGC4321. However, RCICO strongly varies from ~0.05 at the centre of NGC4321 to >0.2-0.5 in NGC1808's starburst centre and NGC7469's centre with an X-ray AGN. Meanwhile, RCICO does not obviously vary with $U$, similar to the prediction of PDR models. We also find a mildly decreasing RCICO with an increasing metallicity over 0.7-0.85 solar metallicity, consistent with the literature. Assuming various typical ISM conditions representing GMCs, active star-forming regions and strong starbursting environments, we calculate the LTE radiative transfer and estimate the [CI/CO] abundance ratio to be ~0.1 across the disks of NGC3627 and NGC4321, similar to previous large-scale findings in Galactic studies. However, this abundance ratio likely has a substantial increase to ~1 and >1-5 in NGC1808's starburst and NGC7469's strong AGN environments, respectively, in line with the expectations for cosmic-ray dominated region (CRDR) and X-ray dominated region (XDR) chemistry. Finally, we do not find a robust evidence for a generally CO-dark, CI-bright gas in the disk areas we probed. (abbreviated) |"

       "|**Abstract**| Feedback and outflows in galaxies that are associated with a quasar phase are expected to be pivotal in quenching the most massive galaxies. However, observations targeting the molecular outflow phase, which dominates both the mass and momentum and removes the immediate fuel for star formation, are limited in high-z QSO hosts. Massive quiescent galaxies found at z ~ 4 are predicted to have already quenched star formation by z ~ 5 and undergone their most intense growth at z > 6. Here, we present two ALMA detections of molecular outflows, traced by blue-shifted absorption of the OH 119 micron doublet, from a sample of three z > 6 infrared luminous QSO hosts: J2310+1855 and P183+05. OH 119 micron is also detected in emission in P183+05, and tentatively in the third source: P036+03. Using similar assumptions as for high-z Dusty Star-Forming Galaxy outflows, we find that our QSOs drive molecular outflows with comparable mass outflow rates, and that are comparably energetic except for J2310+1855's significantly lower outflow energy flux. We do not find evidence, nor require additional input from the central AGN to drive the molecular outflow in J2310+1855 but can not rule out an AGN contribution in P183+05 if a significant AGN contribution to L_FIR is assumed and/or if the outflow covering fraction is high (> 53%), which evidence from the literature suggests is unlikely in these sources. Differences observed in the blue-shifted absorption spectral properties may instead be caused by the QSO hosts' more compact dust continuum, limiting observations to lower altitude and more central regions of the outflow. |"

       "|**Abstract**| Through adaptive optics (AO) imaging with the SOUL+LUCI instrument at the Large Binocular Telescope we were able to resolve, for the first time, individual stars in the gas-rich galaxy DDO68 C. This system was already suggested to be interacting with the extremely metal poor dwarf DDO68, but its nature has remained elusive so far because of the presence of a bright foreground star close to its line of sight, that hampers a detailed study of its stellar population and distance. In our study, we turned this interloper star into an opportunity to have a deeper insight on DDO68 C, using it as a guide star for the AO correction. Although the new data do not allow for a direct distance measurement through the red giant branch tip method, the combined analysis of the resolved-star color-magnitude diagram, of archival GALEX FUV and NUV photometry, and of H$\\alpha$ data provides a self-consistent picture in which DDO68 C is at the same $\\sim$13 Mpc distance as its candidate companion DDO68. These results indicate that DDO68 is a unique case of a low mass dwarf, less massive than the Magellanic Clouds, interacting with three satellites (DDO68 C and two previously confirmed accreting systems), providing useful constraints on cosmological models and a potential explanation for its anomalous extremely low metallicity. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| The gas metallicity distributions across individual galaxies and across galaxy samples can teach us much about how galaxies evolve. Massive galaxies typically possess negative metallicity gradients, and mass and metallicity are tightly correlated on local scales over wide range of galaxy masses; however, the precise origins of such trends remain elusive. Here, we employ data from SDSS-IV MaNGA to explore how gas metallicity depends on local stellar mass density and on galactocentric radius within individual galaxies. We also consider how the strengths of these dependencies vary across the galaxy mass-size plane. We find that radius is more predictive of local metallicity than stellar mass density in extended lower mass galaxies, while we find density and radius to be almost equally predictive in higher-mass and more compact galaxies. Consistent with previous work, we find a mild connection between metallicity gradients and large-scale environment; however, this is insufficient to explain variations in gas metallicity behaviour across the mass-size plane. We argue our results to be consistent with a scenario in which extended galaxies have experienced smooth gas accretion histories, producing negative metallicity gradients over time. We further argue that more compact and more massive systems have experienced increased merging activity that disrupts this process, leading to flatter metallicity gradients and more dominant density-metallicity correlations within individual galaxies. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| High spatial resolution observations of CO isotopologue line emission in protoplanetary disks at mid-inclinations (${\\approx}$30-75{\\deg}) allow us to characterize the gas structure in detail, including radial and vertical substructures, emission surface heights and their dependencies on source characteristics, and disk temperature profiles. By combining observations of a suite of CO isotopologues, we can map the 2D (r, z) disk structure from the disk upper atmosphere, as traced by CO, to near the midplane, as probed by less abundant isotopologues. Here, we present high angular resolution (${\\lesssim}$0.\"1 to ${\\approx}$0.\"2; ${\\approx}$15-30 au) observations of CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O in either or both J=2-1 and J=3-2 lines in the transition disks around DM Tau, Sz 91, LkCa 15, and HD 34282. We derived line emission surfaces in CO for all disks and in $^{13}$CO for the DM Tau and LkCa 15 disks. With these observations, we do not resolve the vertical structure of C$^{18}$O in any disk, which is instead consistent with C$^{18}$O emission originating from the midplane. Both the J=2-1 and J=3-2 lines show similar heights. Using the derived emission surfaces, we computed radial and vertical gas temperature distributions for each disk, including empirical temperature models for the DM Tau and LkCa 15 disks. After combining our sample with literature sources, we find that $^{13}$CO line emitting heights are also tentatively linked with source characteristics, e.g., stellar host mass, gas temperature, disk size, and show steeper trends than seen in CO emission surfaces. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| We present the first spatially resolved measurements of galaxy properties in the JWST ERO SMACS0723 field. We perform a comprehensive analysis of five $5<z<9$ galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from NIRSpec observations. We perform spatially resolved SED fitting with BAGPIPES, using NIRCam imaging in 6 bands spanning the wavelength range $0.8-5\\mu$m. We produce maps of the inferred physical properties by using a novel approach in the study of high redshift galaxies. This method allows us to study the internal structure and assembly of the first generations of galaxies. We find clear gradients both in the empirical colour maps, as well as in most of the estimated physical parameters. We find regions of considerably different specific star formation rates across each galaxy, which points to very bursty star-formation happening on small scales, not galaxy-wide. The integrated light is dominated by these bursty regions, which exhibit strong line emission detected by NIRSpec and also inferred from the broad-band NIRCam images, with the equivalent width of [OIII]+H$\\beta$ reaching up to $\\sim3000-4000$\\AA rest-frame in these regions. Studying these galaxies in an integrated approach yields extremely young inferred ages of the stellar population ($<$10 Myr), which outshine older stellar populations that are only distinguishable in the spatially resolved maps. This leads to inferring $\\sim0.5-1$ dex lower stellar masses by using aperture photometry, when compared to resolved analyses. Such systematics would have strong implications in the shape and evolution of the stellar mass function at these early times, particularly while samples are limited to small numbers of the brightest candidates. Furthermore, the evolved stellar populations revealed in this study imply an extended process of early galaxy formation that could otherwise be hidden behind the light of the most recently formed stars. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| The High Latitude Spectroscopic Survey (HLSS) is the reference baseline spectroscopic survey for NASA's Nancy Grace Roman space telescope, measuring redshifts of $\\sim 10$M H$\\alpha$ emission line galaxies over a $2000$ deg$^2$ footprint at $z=1-2$. In this work, we use a realistic Roman galaxy mock catalogue to explore optimal modeling of the measured power spectrum. We consider two methods for modelling the redshift-space distortions (one with the canonical Kaiser squashing term $M_A$, and another with a window function on $\\beta$ that selects out the coherent radial infall pairwise velocities $M_B$), two models for the nonlinear impact of baryons that smears the BAO signal (one with a fixed ratio between the smearing scales in the perpendicular $k_*^\\perp$ and parallel $k_*^\\parallel$ and another where these smearing scales are kept as a free parameters, P$_{dw}(k|k_*)$ and P$_{dw}(k|\\Sigma_\\perp,\\Sigma_\\parallel)$), and two analytical nonlinear growth corrections (one employing the halo model $F_{HM}$ and another formulated from simulated galaxy clustering of a semi-analytical model $F_{SAM}$). We find that the best model is P$_{dw}(k|\\Sigma_\\perp,\\Sigma_\\parallel)*M_B$, which leads to unbiased measurements of cosmological parameters. We expect the tools that we have developed to be useful in probing dark energy and testing gravity using Roman in an accurate and robust manner. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| We test the merger-induced dual active galactic nuclei (dAGN) paradigm using a sample of 35 radio galaxy pairs from the SDSS Stripe 82 field. Using Keck optical spectroscopy, we confirm 21 pairs have consistent redshifts, constituting kinematic pairs; the remaining 14 pairs are line-of-sight projections. We classify the optical spectral signatures via emission line ratios, equivalent widths, and excess of radio power above star-formation predicted outputs. We find 6 galaxies are classified as LINERs and 7 are AGN/starburst composites. Most of the LINERs are retired galaxies, while the composites likely have AGN contribution. All of the kinematic pairs exhibit radio power more than 10$\\times$ above the level expected from just star-formation, suggestive of a radio AGN contribution. We also analyze high-resolution (0.3\") imaging at 6 GHz from the NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array for 17 of the kinematic pairs. We find 6 pairs (2 new, 4 previously known) host two separate radio cores, confirming their status as dAGNs. The remaining 11 pairs contain single AGNs, with most exhibiting prominent jets/lobes overlapping their companion. Our final census indicates a dAGN duty cycle slightly higher than predictions of purely stochastic fueling, although a larger sample (potentially culled from VLASS) is needed to fully address the dAGN fraction. We conclude that while dAGNs in the Stripe 82 field are rare, the merger process plays some role in their triggering and it facilitates low to moderate levels of accretion. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR) has applications in galaxy evolution as a testbed for the galaxy-halo connection and in observational cosmology as a redshift-independent secondary distance indicator. We use the 31,000+ galaxy ALFALFA sample -- which provides redshifts, velocity widths, and HI content for a large number of gas-bearing galaxies in the local universe -- to fit and test an extensive local universe BTFR. This BTFR is designed to be as inclusive of ALFALFA and comparable samples as possible. Velocity widths measured via an automated method and $M_{b}$ proxies extracted from survey data can be uniformly and efficiently measured for other samples, giving this analysis broad applicability. We also investigate the role of sample demographics in determining the best-fit relation. We find that the best-fit relations are changed significantly by changes to the sample mass range and to second order, mass sampling, gas fraction, different stellar mass and velocity width measurements. We use a subset of ALFALFA with demographics that reflect the full sample to measure a robust BTFR slope of $3.30\\pm0.06$. We apply this relation and estimate source distances, finding general agreement with flow-model distances as well as average distance uncertainties of $\\sim0.17$ dex for the full ALFALFA sample. We demonstrate the utility of these distance estimates by applying them to a sample of sources in the Virgo vicinity, recovering signatures of infall consistent with previous work. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| The neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping (IM) survey is regarded as a promising approach for cosmic large-scale structure (LSS) studies. A major issue for the HI IM survey is to remove the bright foreground contamination. A key to successfully remove the bright foreground is to well control or eliminate the instrumental effects. In this work, we consider the instrumental effect of polarization leakage and use the U-Net approach, a deep learning-based foreground removal technique, to eliminate the polarization leakage effect.In this method, the principal component analysis (PCA) foreground subtraction is used as a preprocessing step for the U-Net foreground subtraction. Our results show that the additional U-Net processing could either remove the foreground residual after the conservative PCA subtraction or compensate for the signal loss caused by the aggressive PCA preprocessing. Finally, we test the robustness of the U-Net foreground subtraction technique and show that it is still reliable in the case of existing constraint error on HI fluctuation amplitude. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| Io's intense volcanic activity results in one of the most colorful surfaces in the solar system. Ultraviolet and visible-wavelength observations of Io are critical to uncovering the chemistry behind its volcanic hues. Here, we present global, spatially resolved UV-visible spectra of Io from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), which bridge the gap between previous highly resolved imagery and disk-integrated spectroscopy, to provide an unprecedented combination of spatial and spectral detail. We use this comprehensive dataset to investigate spectral endmembers, map observed spectral features associated with SO$_2$ frost and other sulfur species, and explore possible compositions in the context of Io surface processes. In agreement with past observations, our results are consistent with extensive equatorial SO$_2$ frost deposits that are stable over multi-decade timescales, widespread sulfur-rich plains surrounding the SO$_2$ deposits, and the enrichment of Pele's pyroclastic ring and the high-latitude regions in metastable short-chain sulfur allotropes. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| Coronal loop oscillations are common phenomena in the solar corona, which are often classified as decaying and decayless oscillations. Using the high-resolution observation measured by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) onboard the Solar Orbiter, we statistical investigate small-scale transverse oscillations with short periods (<200 s) of coronal loops in an active region, i.e., NOAA 12965. A total of 111 coronal loops are identified in EUI 174 A images, and they all reveal transverse oscillations without any significant decaying, regarding as decayless oscillations. Oscillatory periods are measured from about 11 s to 185 s, with a median period of 40 s. Thus, they are also termed as short-period oscillations. The corresponding loop lengths are measured from about 10.5 Mm to 30.2 Mm, and a strong dependence of oscillatory periods on loop lengths is established, indicating that the short-period oscillations are standing kink-mode waves in nature. Based on the coronal seismology, kink speeds are measured to about 330-1910 km/s, and magnetic field strengths in coronal loops are estimated to about 4.1-25.2 G, while the energy flux carried by decayless kink oscillations lies in the range from roughly 7 W m^(-2) to 9220 W m^(-2). Our estimations suggest that the wave energy carried by short-period decayless kink oscillations can not support the coronal heating in the active region. |\n",

By implementing simultaneous multi-frequency receiving systems on the next generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) antennas, it is feasible to carry out a frequency phase transfer (FPT) which could calibrate the non-dispersive propagation errors and significantly increase the phase coherence in the visibility data. Such increase offers an efficient approach for weak source or structure detection. SFPR also makes it possible for high precision astrometry, including the core-shift measurements up to sub-mm wavelengths for Sgr A* and M87* etc. We also briefly discuss the technical and scheduling considerations for future SFPR observations with the ngEHT. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| The accretion of massive star clusters via dynamical friction has previously been established to be a likely scenario for the build up of nuclear stellar clusters (NSCs). A remaining issue is whether strong external tidal perturbation may lead to the severe disruption of loosely-bound clusters well before they sink deeply into the center of their host galaxies. We carry out a series of $N$-body simulations and verify our early idealized analytic models. We show if the density profile of the host galaxies can be described by a power-law distribution with an index, $\\alpha <1$, the cluster would be compressed in the radial direction by the external galactic tidal field. In contrast, the galactic tidal perturbation is disruptive in regions with a steep, $\\alpha >1$, density fall-off or in the very center where gravity is dominated by the point-mass potential of super-massive black holes (SMBHs). This sufficient criterion supplements the conventional necessary Roche-lobe-filling condition in determining the preservation versus disintegration of satellite stellar systems. We simulate the disruption of stellar clusters which venture on nearly-circular, modestly- or highly-eccentric orbits into the center of galaxies with a range of background density profiles and SMBHs. We obtain the spatial distribution of the stellar-cluster remnants. We apply these results to the NSC within a few parsecs from SMBH Sgr A$^\\ast$ at the Galactic Center. Recent observations indicate the coexistence of two populations of stars with distinctively separate ages and metallicities. We verify that the subsolar-metalicity population can be the debris of disrupted stellar clusters. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| Classification is valuable and necessary in spectral analysis, especially for data-driven mining. Along with the rapid development of spectral surveys, a variety of classification techniques have been successfully applied to astronomical data processing. However, it is difficult to select an appropriate classification method in practical scenarios due to the different algorithmic ideas and data characteristics. Here, we present the second work in the data mining series - a review of spectral classification techniques. This work also consists of three parts: a systematic overview of current literature, experimental analyses of commonly used classification algorithms and source codes used in this paper. Firstly, we carefully investigate the current classification methods in astronomical literature and organize these methods into ten types based on their algorithmic ideas. For each type of algorithm, the analysis is organized from the following three perspectives. (1) their current applications and usage frequencies in spectral classification are summarized; (2) their basic ideas are introduced and preliminarily analysed; (3) the advantages and caveats of each type of algorithm are discussed. Secondly, the classification performance of different algorithms on the unified data sets is analysed. Experimental data are selected from the LAMOST survey and SDSS survey. Six groups of spectral data sets are designed from data characteristics, data qualities and data volumes to examine the performance of these algorithms.

       "|**Abstract**| We present TXPipe, a modular, automated and reproducible pipeline for generating data vectors in cosmology analyses. The pipeline is developed within the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC), and designed for cosmology analyses using LSST data. In this paper, we present the pipeline for the so-called 3$\\times$2pt analysis - a combination of three two-point functions that measure the auto- and cross-correlation between galaxy density and shapes. We perform the analysis both in real and harmonic space using TXPipe and other LSST-DESC tools. We validate the pipeline using Gaussian simulations and show that the pipeline accurately measures data vectors and recovers the input cosmology to the accuracy level required for the first year of LSST data. We also apply the pipeline to a realistic mock galaxy sample extracted from the CosmoDC2 simulation suite Korytov et al. (2019). TXPipe establishes a baseline framework that can be built upon as the LSST survey proceeds. Furthermore, the pipeline is designed to be easily extended to science probes beyond the 3$\\times$2pt analysis. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| The nearby bright M-dwarf star L~98-59 has three terrestrial-sized planets. One challenge remaining in characterizing atmospheres around such planets is that it is not known a priori whether they possess any atmospheres. Here we report the study of the atmospheres of L~98-59~c and L~98-59~d using the near-infrared spectral data from the G141 grism of HST/WFC3. We can reject the hypothesis of a clear atmosphere dominated by hydrogen and helium at a confidence level of $\\sim$ 3~sigma for both planets. Thus they may have a primary hydrogen-dominated atmosphere with an opaque cloud layer, or have lost their primary hydrogen-dominated atmosphere and re-established a secondary thin atmosphere, or have no atmosphere at all. We cannot distinguish between these scenarios for the two planets using the current HST data. Future observations with JWST would be capable of confirming the existence of atmospheres around L~98-59~c and d and determining their compositions. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| (704) Interamnia is one of the largest asteroids that locates in the outer main-belt region, which may contain a large amount of water ice underneath its surface. We observe this asteroid using 8.2 m Subaru telescope at mid-infrared wavebands, and utilize thermophysical model for realistic surface layers (RSTPM) to analyze mid-infrared data from Subaru along with those of IRAS, AKARI and WISE/NEOWISE. We optimize the method to convert the WISE magnitude to thermal infrared flux with temperature dependent color corrections, which can provide significant references for main-belt asteroids at a large heliocentric distance with low surface temperature. We derive best-fitting thermal parameters of Interamnia - a mean regolith grain size of $190_{-180}^{+460}~\\rm \\mu m$, with a roughness of $0.30_{-0.17}^{+0.35}$ and RMS slope of $27_{-9}^{+13}$ degrees, thereby producing thermal inertia ranging from 9 to $92~\\rm Jm^{-2}s^{-1/2}K^{-1}$ due to seasonal temperature variation. The geometric albedo and effective diameter are evaluated to be $0.0472_{-0.0031}^{+0.0033}$ and $339_{-11}^{+12}~\\rm km$, respectively, being indicative of a bulk density of $1.86\\pm0.63~\\rm g/cm^3$. The low thermal inertia is consistent with typical B/C-type asteroids with $D\\geq100$ km. The tiny regolith grain size suggests the presence of a fine regolith on the surface of Interamnia. Moreover, the seasonal and diurnal temperature distribution indicates that thermal features between southern and northern hemisphere appear to be very different. Finally, we present an estimation of volume fraction of water ice of $9\\%\\sim66\\%$ from the published grain density and porosity of carbonaceous chondrites. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| The inheritance of material across the star and planet formation process is traced by deuterium fractionation. We report here the first detection of doubly deuterated methanol towards pre-stellar cores. We study the deuterium fractionation of methanol, CH$_{3}$OH, towards two starless and two pre-stellar cores. We derive a D/H ratio of 0.8-1.9$\\%$ with CH$_{2}$DOH in pre-stellar cores H-MM1 and L694-2, consistent with measurements in more evolved Class 0/I objects and comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, suggesting a direct chemical link arising in the pre-stellar stage. Furthermore, the column density ratios of CHD$_{2}$OH/CH$_{2}$DOH are $\\sim$50-80$\\%$, consistently high as that towards Class 0/I objects, indicating an efficient formation mechanism of CHD$_{2}$OH, possibly through H atom additions to D$_{2}$CO. The CH$_{2}$DOH/CH$_{3}$OH and CHD$_{2}$OH/CH$_{3}$OH column density ratios in the two pre-stellar cores are larger than that in the two starless cores B68 and L1521E, representing an evolutionary trend of methanol deuteration in early-stage cores. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| To understand the mechanism behind high-$z$ Ly${\\alpha}$ nebulae, we simulate the scattering of Ly${\\alpha}$ in a $\\rm H\\,I$ halo about a central Ly${\\alpha}$ source. For the first time, we consider both smooth and clumpy distributions of halo gas, as well as a range of outflow speeds, total $\\rm H\\,I$ column densities, $\\rm H\\,I$ spatial concentrations, and central source galaxies (e.g., with Ly${\\alpha}$ line widths corresponding to those typical of AGN or star-forming galaxies). We compute the spatial-frequency diffusion and the polarization of the Ly${\\alpha}$ photons scattered by atomic hydrogen. Our scattering-only model reproduces the typical size of Ly${\\alpha}$ nebulae ($\\sim 100\\,$kpc) at total column densities $N_{\\rm HI} \\geq 10^{20} \\rm cm^{-2}$ and predicts a range of positive, flat, and negative polarization radial gradients. We also find two general classes of Ly${\\alpha}$ nebula morphologies: with and without bright cores. Cores are seen when $N_{\\rm HI}$ is low, i.e., when the central source is directly visible, and are associated with a polarization jump, a steep increase in the polarization radial profile just outside the halo center. Of all the parameters tested in our smooth or clumpy medium model, $N_{\\rm HI}$ dominates the trends. The radial behaviors of the Ly${\\alpha}$ surface brightness, spectral line shape, and polarization in the clumpy model with covering factor $f_c \\gtrsim 5$ approach those of the smooth model at the same $N_{\\rm HI}$. A clumpy medium with high $N_{\\rm HI}$ and low $f_c \\lesssim 2$ generates Ly${\\alpha}$ features via scattering that the smooth model cannot: a bright core, symmetric line profile, and polarization jump. |\n",

We present a brief description of the satellite and focus on the LFIS payload. The in-orbit commissioning confirmed a reliable operational status of the instrumentation. We also present results of a transition observation, which offers unique measurements on several novel aspects. We estimate the RFI suppression required for such a radio astronomy instrumentation at the Moon distances from Earth to be of the order of 80 dB. We analyse a method of separating Earth- and satellite-originated radio frequency interference (RFI). It is found that the RFI level at frequencies lower than a few MHz is smaller than the receiver noise floor. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| We report the flux and spectral variability of PG 1553+113 on intra-night (IDV) to short-term timescales using BVRI data collected over 91 nights from 28 February to 8 November 2019 employing ten optical telescopes: three in Bulgaria, two each in India and Serbia, and one each in Greece, Georgia, and Latvia. We monitored the blazar quasi-simultaneously for 16 nights in the V and R bands and 8 nights in the V, R, I bands and examined the light curves (LCs) for intra-day flux and colour variations using two powerful tests: the power-enhanced F-test and the nested ANOVA test. The source was found to be significantly (> 99%) variable in 4 nights out of 27 in R-band, 1 out of 16 in V-band, and 1 out of 6 nights in I-band. No temporal variations in the colours were observed on IDV timescale. During the course of these observations the total variation in R-band was 0.89 mag observed. We also investigated the spectral energy distribution (SED) using B, V, R, and I band data. We found optical spectral indices in the range of 0.878+-0.029 to 1.106+-0.065 by fitting a power law to these SEDs of PG 1553+113. We found that the source follows a bluer-when-brighter trend on IDV timescales. We discuss possible physical causes of the observed spectral variability. |\n",

       "|**Abstract**| The ubiquity of sulfur ions within the Jovian magnetosphere has led to suggestions that the implantation of these ions into the surface of Europa may lead to the formation of SO2. However, previous studies on the implantation of sulfur ions into H2O ice (the dominant species on the Europan surface) have failed to detect SO2 formation. Other studies concerned with similar implantations into CO2 ice, which is also known to exist on Europa, have offered seemingly conflicting results. In this letter, we describe the results of a study on the implantation of 290 keV S+ ions into condensed CO2 at 20 and 70 K. Our results demonstrate that SO2 is observed after implantation at 20 K, but not at the Europa-relevant temperature of 70 K. We conclude that this process is likely not a reasonable mechanism for SO2 formation on Europa, and that other mechanisms should be explored instead. |\n",

       "**Abstract:** Expansion of wind-blown bubbles or$\\hii$regions lead to formation of shocks in the interstellar medium, which compress surrounding gas into dense layers. We made spatially and velocity-resolved observations of the RCW 120 PDR and nearby molecular gas with$\\co$and$\\tco$lines and distinguished a bright CO-emitting layer, which we related with the dense shocked molecular gas moving away from the ionizing star due to expansion of$\\hii$region. Simulating gas density and temperature, as well as brightness of several CO and C+ emission lines from the PDR, we found reasonable agreement with the observed values. Analysing gas kinematics, we revealed the large-scale shocked PDR and also several dense environments of embedded protostars and outflows. We observe the shocked layer as the most regular structure in the$\\co$map and in the velocity space, when the gas around YSOs is dispersed by the outflows.\n",

       "**Abstract:** Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) play a critical role in the reprocessing of stellar radiation and in balancing the heating and cooling processes in the interstellar medium (ISM), but appear to be destroyed in$\\HII$regions.However, the mechanisms driving their destruction are still not completely understood. Using  PHANGS-JWST and PHANGS-MUSE observations,we investigate how the PAH fraction changes in about 1500$\\HII$regions across four nearby star-forming galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 1365, NGC 7496, IC 5332). We find a strong anti-correlation between the PAH fraction and the ionization parameter (the ratio between the ionizing photon flux and the hydrogen density)  of$\\HII$regions. This relation becomes steeper for more luminous$\\HII$regions. The metallicity of$\\HII$regions has only a minor impact on these results in our galaxy sample. We find that the PAH fraction decreases with the$\\Ha$equivalent width -- a proxy for the age of the$\\HII$regions -- although this trend is much weaker than the one identified using the ionization parameter. Our results are consistent with a scenario where hydrogen-ionizing UV radiation is the dominant source of PAH destruction in star-forming regions.\n",

       "**Abstract:** Large-scale bars can fuel galaxy centers with molecular gas, often leading to the development of dense ring-like structures where intense star formation occurs, forming a very different environment compared to galactic disks. We pair$\\sim$0.3$\\arcsec$(30 pc) resolution new JWST/MIRI imaging with archival ALMA CO(2-1) mapping of the central$\\sim$5 kpc of the nearby barred spiral galaxy NGC 1365, to investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for this extreme star formation.The molecular gas morphology is resolved into two well-known bright bar lanes that surround a smooth dynamically cold gas disk ($\\rm R_{gal} \\sim 475 pc$) reminiscent of non-star-forming disks in early type galaxies and likely fed by gas inflow triggered by stellar feedback in the lanes. The lanes host a large number of JWST-identified massive young star clusters. We find some evidence for temporal star formation evolution along the ring.The complex kinematics in the gas lanes reveal strong streaming motions and may be consistent with convergence of gas streamlines expected there. Indeed, the extreme line-widths are found to be the result of inter-`cloud' motion between gas peaks;{\\sc ScousePy}decomposition reveals multiple components with line widths of$\\rm \\langle\\sigma_{CO,scouse}\\rangle \\approx 19 km s^{-1}$and surface densities of$\\rm \\langle \\Sigma_{H_2,scouse}\\rangle \\approx  800 M_{\\odot} pc^{-2}$, similar to the properties observed throughout the rest of the central molecular gas structure.  Tailored hydro-dynamical simulations exhibit many of the observed properties and imply that the observed structures are transient and highly time-variable.  From our study of NGC 1365, we conclude that it is predominantly the high gas inflow triggered by the bar that is setting the star formation in its CMZ.\n",

       "**Abstract:** Among the most central open questions on the initial mass function (IMF) of stars is the impact of the environment on the shape of the core mass function (CMF) and thus potentially on the IMF.The ALMA-IMF Large Program aims to investigate the variations of the core distributions (CMF and mass segregation) with cloud characteristics such as the density and kinematic of the gas, as diagnostic observables of the formation process and evolution. The present study focuses on the W43-MM2\\&MM3 mini-starburst, whose CMF has been recently found to be top-heavy with respect to the Salpeter slope of the canonical IMF.W43-MM2\\&MM3 is a useful test case for environmental studies because it harbors a rich cluster containing a statistically significant number of cores (specifically, 205 cores), previously characterized in paper III. We applied a multiscale decomposition technique on the ALMA 1.3 mm and 3 mm continuum images of W43-MM2\\&MM3 to define six subregions each of 0.5-1 pc in size. For each subregion we characterize the high column density probability distribution function,$\\eta$-PDF, shape of the cloud gas using the 1.3 mm image. Using the core catalog, we investigate correlations between the CMF and, cloud and core properties such as the$\\eta$-PDF and core mass segregation.We classify the W43-MM2\\&MM3 subregions into different stages of evolution, from quiescent to burst to post-burst, based on the surface number density of cores, number of outflows, and UC$\\hii$presence. The high-mass end ($>$1$\\Msol$) of the subregion CMFs vary from being close to the Salpeter slope (quiescent) to top-heavy (burst and post-burst). Moreover, the second tail of the$\\eta$-PDF varies from steep (quiescent), to flat (burst and post-burst) like observed for the high mass star-forming clouds. We found that subregions with flat second$\\eta$-PDF tails display top-heavy CMFs.In dynamical environments such as W43-MM2\\&MM3, the high-mass end of the CMF appears to be rooted in the cloud structure at high (column) densities that surrounds cores. This connection stems from the fact that cores and their immediate surroundings are both determined and shaped by cloud formation process, current evolutionary state of the cloud, and broader the star formation history. The CMF may evolve from Salpeter to top-heavy throughout the star formation process from the quiescent to the burst phase. This scenario raises the question of if the CMF might revert again to Salpeter as the cloud approaches the end of its star formation stage, a hypothesis that remains to be tested.\n",

       "**Abstract:** This study investigates and compares brightness and area of coronal bright points (CBPs) inside and outside of coronal holes (CHs) using the single-dish Band 6 observations by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), combined with extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) 193 $\\overset{\\circ}{\\mathrm{A}}$ filtergrams obtained by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and magnetograms obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), both on board Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The CH boundaries were extracted from the SDO/AIA images using the Collection of Analysis Tools for Coronal Holes (CATCH) and CBPs were identified in the SDO/AIA, SDO/HMI, and ALMA data. Measurements of brightness and areas in both ALMA and SDO/AIA images were conducted for CBPs within CHs and quiet Sun regions outside CHs. A statistical analysis of the measured physical properties resulted in a lower average CBP brightness in both ALMA and SDO/AIA data for CBPs within the CHs. Depending on the CBP sample size, the difference in intensity for the SDO/AIA data, and brightness temperature for the ALMA data, between the CBPs inside and outside CHs ranged from between 2$\\sigma$ and 4.5$\\sigma$, showing a statistically significant difference between those two CBP groups. For CBP areas, CBPs within the CH boundaries showed smaller areas on average, with the observed difference between the two CBP groups between 1$\\sigma$ and 2$\\sigma$ for the SDO/AIA data, and up to 3.5$\\sigma$ for the ALMA data, indicating that CBP areas are also significantly different. Given the measured properties, we conclude that the CBPs inside CHs tend to be less bright on average, but also smaller in comparison to those outside of CHs. This conclusion might point to the specific physical conditions and properties of the local CH region around a CBP limiting the maximum achievable intensity (temperature) and size of a CBP. \n",

       "$We compare embedded young massive star clusters (YMCs) to (sub-)millimeter line observations tracing the excitation and dissociation of molecular gas in the starburst ring of NGC~1365. This galaxy hosts one of the strongest nuclear starbursts and richest populations of YMCs within 20~Mpc.$\n",
       "$Here we combine near-/mid-IR PHANGS-JWST imaging with new ALMA multi-J CO(1--0, 2--1 and 4--3) and [\\CI](1--0) mapping, which we use to trace CO excitation via \\Remark{R42}=\\Remark{ICO43}/\\Remark{ICO21} and \\Remark{R21}=\\Remark{ICO21}/\\Remark{ICO10} and dissociation via \\Remark{RCICO}=\\Remark{ICI10}/\\Remark{ICO21} at 330~pc resolution.$\n",
       "$We find that the gas flowing into the starburst ring from northeast to southwest appears strongly affected by stellar feedback, showing decreased excitation (lower \\Remark{R42}) and increased signatures of dissociation (higher \\Remark{RCICO}) in the downstream regions.$\n",
       "$There, radiative transfer modelling suggests that the molecular gas density decreases and temperature and \\XCICO abundance ratio increase.$\n",
       "$We compare \\Remark{R42} and \\Remark{RCICO} with local conditions across the regions and find that both correlate with near-IR 2~\\um emission tracing the YMCs and with both PAH (11.3~\\um) and dust continuum (21~\\um) emission.$\n",
       "$In general, \\Remark{RCICO} exhibits \\sim 0.1~dex tighter correlations than \\Remark{R42}, suggesting \\CI  to be a more sensitive tracer of changing physical conditions in the NGC~1365 starburst than CO(4--3).$\n",
       "$Our results are consistent with a scenario where gas flows into the two arm regions along the bar, becomes condensed/shocked, forms YMCs, and then these YMCs heat and dissociate the gas.$\n",

       "$We compare embedded young massive star clusters (YMCs) to (sub-)millimeter line observations tracing the excitation and dissociation of molecular gas in the starburst ring of NGC~1365. This galaxy hosts one of the strongest nuclear starbursts and richest populations of YMCs within 20~Mpc.$\n",
       "$Here we combine near-/mid-IR PHANGS-JWST imaging with new ALMA multi-J CO(1--0, 2--1 and 4--3) and [\\CI](1--0) mapping, which we use to trace CO excitation via \\Remark{R42}=\\Remark{ICO43}/\\Remark{ICO21} and \\Remark{R21}=\\Remark{ICO21}/\\Remark{ICO10} and dissociation via \\Remark{RCICO}=\\Remark{ICI10}/\\Remark{ICO21} at 330~pc resolution.$\n",
       "$We find that the gas flowing into the starburst ring from northeast to southwest appears strongly affected by stellar feedback, showing decreased excitation (lower \\Remark{R42}) and increased signatures of dissociation (higher \\Remark{RCICO}) in the downstream regions.$\n",
       "$There, radiative transfer modelling suggests that the molecular gas density decreases and temperature and \\XCICO abundance ratio increase.$\n",
       "$We compare \\Remark{R42} and \\Remark{RCICO} with local conditions across the regions and find that both correlate with near-IR 2~\\um emission tracing the YMCs and with both PAH (11.3~\\um) and dust continuum (21~\\um) emission.$\n",
       "$In general, \\Remark{RCICO} exhibits \\sim 0.1~dex tighter correlations than \\Remark{R42}, suggesting \\CI  to be a more sensitive tracer of changing physical conditions in the NGC~1365 starburst than CO(4--3).$\n",
       "$Our results are consistent with a scenario where gas flows into the two arm regions along the bar, becomes condensed/shocked, forms YMCs, and then these YMCs heat and dissociate the gas.$\n",

       "$We compare embedded young massive star clusters (YMCs) to (sub-)millimeter line observations tracing the excitation and dissociation of molecular gas in the starburst ring of NGC~1365. This galaxy hosts one of the strongest nuclear starbursts and richest populations of YMCs within 20~Mpc.$\n",
       "$Here we combine near-/mid-IR PHANGS-JWST imaging with new ALMA multi-J CO(1--0, 2--1 and 4--3) and [\\CI](1--0) mapping, which we use to trace CO excitation via \\Remark{R42}=\\Remark{ICO43}/\\Remark{ICO21} and \\Remark{R21}=\\Remark{ICO21}/\\Remark{ICO10} and dissociation via \\Remark{RCICO}=\\Remark{ICI10}/\\Remark{ICO21} at 330~pc resolution.$\n",
       "$We find that the gas flowing into the starburst ring from northeast to southwest appears strongly affected by stellar feedback, showing decreased excitation (lower \\Remark{R42}) and increased signatures of dissociation (higher \\Remark{RCICO}) in the downstream regions.$\n",
       "$There, radiative transfer modelling suggests that the molecular gas density decreases and temperature and \\XCICO abundance ratio increase.$\n",
       "$We compare \\Remark{R42} and \\Remark{RCICO} with local conditions across the regions and find that both correlate with near-IR 2~\\um emission tracing the YMCs and with both PAH (11.3~\\um) and dust continuum (21~\\um) emission.$\n",
       "$In general, \\Remark{RCICO} exhibits \\sim 0.1~dex tighter correlations than \\Remark{R42}, suggesting \\CI  to be a more sensitive tracer of changing physical conditions in the NGC~1365 starburst than CO(4--3).$\n",
       "$Our results are consistent with a scenario where gas flows into the two arm regions along the bar, becomes condensed/shocked, forms YMCs, and then these YMCs heat and dissociate the gas.$\n",

       "$We compare embedded young massive star clusters (YMCs) to (sub-)millimeter line observations tracing the excitation and dissociation of molecular gas in the starburst ring of NGC~1365. This galaxy hosts one of the strongest nuclear starbursts and richest populations of YMCs within 20~Mpc.$\n",
       "$Here we combine near-/mid-IR PHANGS-JWST imaging with new ALMA multi-J CO(1--0, 2--1 and 4--3) and [\\CI](1--0) mapping, which we use to trace CO excitation via \\Remark{R42}=\\Remark{ICO43}/\\Remark{ICO21} and \\Remark{R21}=\\Remark{ICO21}/\\Remark{ICO10} and dissociation via \\Remark{RCICO}=\\Remark{ICI10}/\\Remark{ICO21} at 330~pc resolution.$\n",
       "$We find that the gas flowing into the starburst ring from northeast to southwest appears strongly affected by stellar feedback, showing decreased excitation (lower \\Remark{R42}) and increased signatures of dissociation (higher \\Remark{RCICO}) in the downstream regions.$\n",
       "$There, radiative transfer modelling suggests that the molecular gas density decreases and temperature and \\XCICO abundance ratio increase.$\n",
       "$We compare \\Remark{R42} and \\Remark{RCICO} with local conditions across the regions and find that both correlate with near-IR 2~\\um emission tracing the YMCs and with both PAH (11.3~\\um) and dust continuum (21~\\um) emission.$\n",
       "$In general, \\Remark{RCICO} exhibits \\sim 0.1~dex tighter correlations than \\Remark{R42}, suggesting \\CI  to be a more sensitive tracer of changing physical conditions in the NGC~1365 starburst than CO(4--3).$\n",
       "$Our results are consistent with a scenario where gas flows into the two arm regions along the bar, becomes condensed/shocked, forms YMCs, and then these YMCs heat and dissociate the gas.$\n",

       "$We compare embedded young massive star clusters (YMCs) to (sub-)millimeter line observations tracing the excitation and dissociation of molecular gas in the starburst ring of NGC~1365. This galaxy hosts one of the strongest nuclear starbursts and richest populations of YMCs within 20~Mpc.$\n",
       "$Here we combine near-/mid-IR PHANGS-JWST imaging with new ALMA multi-J CO(1--0, 2--1 and 4--3) and [$\\CI$](1--0) mapping, which we use to trace CO excitation via $\\Remark${R42}=$\\Remark${ICO43}/$\\Remark${ICO21} and $\\Remark${R21}=$\\Remark${ICO21}/$\\Remark${ICO10} and dissociation via $\\Remark${RCICO}=$\\Remark${ICI10}/$\\Remark${ICO21} at 330~pc resolution.$\n",
       "$We find that the gas flowing into the starburst ring from northeast to southwest appears strongly affected by stellar feedback, showing decreased excitation (lower $\\Remark${R42}) and increased signatures of dissociation (higher $\\Remark${RCICO}) in the downstream regions.$\n",
       "$There, radiative transfer modelling suggests that the molecular gas density decreases and temperature and $\\XCICO$ abundance ratio increase.$\n",
       "$We compare $\\Remark${R42} and $\\Remark${RCICO} with local conditions across the regions and find that both correlate with near-IR 2~$\\um$ emission tracing the YMCs and with both PAH (11.3~$\\um$) and dust continuum (21~$\\um$) emission.$\n",
       "$In general, $\\Remark${RCICO} exhibits \\sim 0.1~dex tighter correlations than $\\Remark${R42}, suggesting $\\CI$  to be a more sensitive tracer of changing physical conditions in the NGC~1365 starburst than CO(4--3).$\n",
       "$Our results are consistent with a scenario where gas flows into the two arm regions along the bar, becomes condensed/shocked, forms YMCs, and then these YMCs heat and dissociate the gas.$\n",

       "$We compare embedded young massive star clusters (YMCs) to (sub-)millimeter line observations tracing the excitation and dissociation of molecular gas in the starburst ring of NGC~1365. This galaxy hosts one of the strongest nuclear starbursts and richest populations of YMCs within 20~Mpc.$\n",
       "$Here we combine near-/mid-IR PHANGS-JWST imaging with new ALMA multi-J CO(1--0, 2--1 and 4--3) and [$\\CI$](1--0) mapping, which we use to trace CO excitation via $\\Remark${R42}=$\\Remark${ICO43}/$\\Remark${ICO21} and $\\Remark${R21}=$\\Remark${ICO21}/$\\Remark${ICO10} and dissociation via $\\Remark${RCICO}=$\\Remark${ICI10}/$\\Remark${ICO21} at 330~pc resolution.$\n",
       "$We find that the gas flowing into the starburst ring from northeast to southwest appears strongly affected by stellar feedback, showing decreased excitation (lower $\\Remark${R42}) and increased signatures of dissociation (higher $\\Remark${RCICO}) in the downstream regions.$\n",
       "$There, radiative transfer modelling suggests that the molecular gas density decreases and temperature and $\\XCICO$ abundance ratio increase.$\n",
       "$We compare $\\Remark${R42} and $\\Remark${RCICO} with local conditions across the regions and find that both correlate with near-IR 2~$\\um$ emission tracing the YMCs and with both PAH (11.3~$\\um$) and dust continuum (21~$\\um$) emission.$\n",
       "$In general, $\\Remark${RCICO} exhibits \\sim 0.1~dex tighter correlations than $\\Remark${R42}, suggesting $\\CI$  to be a more sensitive tracer of changing physical conditions in the NGC~1365 starburst than CO(4--3).$\n",
       "$Our results are consistent with a scenario where gas flows into the two arm regions along the bar, becomes condensed/shocked, forms YMCs, and then these YMCs heat and dissociate the gas.$\n",

       "$We compare embedded young massive star clusters (YMCs) to (sub-)millimeter line observations tracing the excitation and dissociation of molecular gas in the starburst ring of NGC~1365. This galaxy hosts one of the strongest nuclear starbursts and richest populations of YMCs within 20~Mpc.$\n",
       "$Here we combine near-/mid-IR PHANGS-JWST imaging with new ALMA multi-J CO(1--0, 2--1 and 4--3) and [$\\CI$](1--0) mapping, which we use to trace CO excitation via $\\Remark${R42}=$\\Remark${ICO43}/$\\Remark${ICO21} and $\\Remark${R21}=$\\Remark${ICO21}/$\\Remark${ICO10} and dissociation via $\\Remark${RCICO}=$\\Remark${ICI10}/$\\Remark${ICO21} at 330~pc resolution.$\n",
       "$We find that the gas flowing into the starburst ring from northeast to southwest appears strongly affected by stellar feedback, showing decreased excitation (lower $\\Remark${R42}) and increased signatures of dissociation (higher $\\Remark${RCICO}) in the downstream regions.$\n",
       "$There, radiative transfer modelling suggests that the molecular gas density decreases and temperature and $\\XCICO$ abundance ratio increase.$\n",
       "$We compare $\\Remark${R42} and $\\Remark${RCICO} with local conditions across the regions and find that both correlate with near-IR 2~$\\um$ emission tracing the YMCs and with both PAH (11.3~$\\um$) and dust continuum (21~$\\um$) emission.$\n",
       "$In general, $\\Remark${RCICO} exhibits \\sim 0.1~dex tighter correlations than $\\Remark${R42}, suggesting $\\CI$  to be a more sensitive tracer of changing physical conditions in the NGC~1365 starburst than CO(4--3).$\n",
       "$Our results are consistent with a scenario where gas flows into the two arm regions along the bar, becomes condensed/shocked, forms YMCs, and then these YMCs heat and dissociate the gas.$\n",

       "$Neutral atomic carbon (C^0 or \\neutralcarbon) is an important phase of carbon in the interstellar medium (ISM) besides ionized carbon (C^+ or \\ionizedcarbon) and carbon monoxide (CO).$\n",
       "$Its ^{3}P state is split into three fine-structure levels. The^{3}P_{1} \\to  ^{3}P_{0} transition line at 492.16065~GHz,$\n",

       "$and the^{3}P_{2} \\to  ^{3}P_{1} transition line at 809.34197~GHz has E_u = 62.462~K and n_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\sim 3.4 \\times 10^{3} \\;\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}.$\n",
       "$Therefore, they are easily excited in the cold ISM environment.$\n",
       "$Given the high abundance of carbon in the ISM, \\neutralcarbon, CO and \\ionizedcarbon  are the most powerful cold ISM tracers, and are the most widely used tools to probe cold ISM properties and hence galaxy evolution at cosmological distances.$\n",

       "$In the simple plane-parallel (i.e., 1-D) PDR model, \\neutralcarbon  exists in a layer where UV photons can penetrate through the molecular gas but cannot maintain a high carbon ionizing rate.$\n",

Region~22 of NGC~3627 and the outer pixels in the two starburst/AGN galaxies make the tips of the blue and gray faint-end tails, respectively. But most of these features should still be spurious.

       "$In Fig.~\\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} we show the non-LTE version of Fig.~\\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}.$\n",
       "$The non-LTE result does not qualitatively differ from that of LTE.$\n",
       "$The most obvious difference is that at high temperature (\\Tkin > 50~K, given our other assumed conditions), the required [\\CI/CO] is lower by \\times 2 for the same observed \\RCICO, whereas at low temperature (\\Tkin \\sim 15~K) a \\lesssim 2 \\times [\\CI/CO] is expected for the observed line ratio.$\n",
       "$As listed in the title of each panel, we assume \\log \\nHtwo / \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} = 2.5 to 3.0 for our conditions (1) to (7).$\n",
       "$This is based on the fact that low-J CO and \\CI  trace the bulk of molecular gas with \\log \\nHtwo / \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} \\sim 2--3 (e.g., \\citealt{Leroy2017,Liudz2021a}), with a typical value \\nHtwo \\sim 300   \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} widely adopted/found for Galactic and nearby galaxy GMCs (e.g., \\citealt{Koda2012,Pety2017}, see also simulations of \\citealt{Glover2012b}), whereas a smaller portion of their emission is from the dense gas with \\log \\nHtwo / \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} \\sim 4--6 (e.g., \\citealt{Gao2004a}).$\n",
       "$The fraction of the dense gas is expected to increase in more starbursting environment (\\citealt{Gao2004b}), so does the mean gas density (\\citealt{Liudz2021a}). Therefore, a \\log \\nHtwo / \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} of 3.0 is perhaps a reasonable assumption, or at least a lower limit for our galaxy centres. A 10 \\times higher density does not qualitatively change Fig.~\\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} except for shifting the expected \\RNCINCO to be 50\\% higher in the \\Tkin > 50~K conditions (making Fig.~\\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} more like Fig.~\\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}).$\n",
       "$Therefore, our non-LTE result strongly confirms the LTE result in the previous section, that the intrinsic \\CI/CO abundance has to vary significantly from about 0.1--0.2 to about 1--3, in order to explain the observed line ratios from Galactic GMCs (hundred pc scales) and NGC~3627/4321 SF disk GMCs to NGC~1808/7469 SB disk/AGN (r \\lesssim 250~pc) environments.$\n",

       "$\\label{sec: Discussion}$\n",
       "$From this study we see that the line ratio \\RCICO increases from 0.1 to 0.2 and > 0.5 from the SF disk to the SB disk and the vicinity (few hundred pc) of X-ray luminous AGN. Although we may be limited by our sample,$\n",
       "$we suggest that this trend can be extended to general cases at both local and high redshift, because the \\CI/CO abundance ratio enhancement is well-predicted by the CRDR and XDR theories.$\n",
       "$\\citet{Papadopoulos2010c} and \\citet{Papadopoulos2011} pointed out the key role of CRDR in local (U)LIRGs. With UV photons alone, cold gas in starbursting environments can still be well shielded, hence as cold as \\sim 10~K. However, with CRs produced from O, B star clusters and supernova remnants, the gas can be uniformly illuminated and heated up.$\n",
       "$The extremely starbursty local ULIRGs have a CR density (\\xi_{\\mathrm{CR}}) 10^{3}--10^{4} times that of the Milky Way (\\citealt{Papadopoulos2010c}), and thus will naturally dissociate more CO into \\CI .$\n",
       "$\\citet{Bisbas2017} and \\citet{Papadopoulos2018} conducted simulations of molecular gas at tens of pc scale with varying CR strength, and found that when \\xi_{\\mathrm{CR}} is \\sim 1 \\textnormal{--} 100   \\times Galactic value, the gas temperature in the dense gas remains largely unaffected (\\sim 10~K).$\n",
       "$However, when \\xi_{\\mathrm{CR}} reaches \\sim 1000   \\times Galactic value as in (U)LIRGs, the gas temperature increases to 30--50~K. The \\citet{Bisbas2017} simulation also shows that the \\CI  and \\ionizedcarbon  fractional abundances at \\log A_V \\sim 0.5 increase by one and three orders of magnitude, respectively, and the CO fractional abundance decreases correspondingly by over two orders of magnitude, with an increasing \\xi_{\\mathrm{CR}} from the Galactic value to 100   \\times of that.$\n",
       "$These results are in line with our calculations in Sect.~\\ref{subsec: LTE}.$\n",
       "$Meanwhile, the AGN-driven XDR chemistry and molecule/atom excitation have been firstly modeled in great detail by \\citet{Maloney1996}, \\citet{Meijerink2005} and \\citet{Meijerink2007}. In XDRs, photo-ionization becomes the dominant heating source instead of photo-electric emission from dust grains in PDRs, thus more molecules are dissociated and/or ionized. \\citet{Meijerink2005}'s Model~1 shows that CO molecules are fully dissociated when N_{\\mathrm{H}} < 10^{23}   \\mathrm{cm^{-2}}, then the fractional abundance is gradually increased by six orders of magnitudes from N_{\\mathrm{H}} = 10^{23}   \\mathrm{cm^{-2}} to 10^{24}   \\mathrm{cm^{-2}}. By contrast, the \\CI  and \\ionizedcarbon  abundances are about constant until reaching the densest part (N_{\\mathrm{H}} > 10^{24.5}   \\mathrm{cm^{-2}}). Unlike in PDRs, there is no clear \\ionizedcarbon /\\CI /CO stratification in XDRs (\\citealt{Meijerink2007,Wolfire2022}). Their Model~2 with a 100 \\times higher energy deposition rate shows that the CO distribution contracts to the highest gas density spots, and the total cumulative [\\CI/CO] is increased by about 0.2~dex, reaching \\RNCINCO \\sim 1.6.$\n",
       "$This value agrees well with our calculations shown in Figs.~\\ref{fig: LTE RCICO} and \\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} (the ISM condition 7).$\n",
       "$Therefore, both in theoretical and observational views, it is clear that the \\RCICO line ratio is a good indicator of the starburst's CRDR and AGN's XDR.$\n",
       "$If a \\RCICO line ratio (to be specific, \\Remark{ICI10}/\\Remark{ICO21}) reaches 0.2--0.5, then the CRDR plays a crucial role and the abundance ratio [\\CI/CO] could be \\sim 1.$\n",
       "$If it exceeds 0.5--1.0, then it may only be enhanced by an XDR, e.g., caused by an X-ray luminous AGN, which boosts the abundance ratio [\\CI/CO] to \\gtrsim 1--2.$\n",

       "$Neutral atomic carbon (C^0 or \\neutralcarbon) is an important phase of carbon in the interstellar medium (ISM) besides ionized carbon (C^+ or \\ionizedcarbon) and carbon monoxide (CO).$\n",
       "$Its ^{3}P state is split into three fine-structure levels. The^{3}P_{1} \\to  ^{3}P_{0} transition line at 492.16065~GHz,$\n",
       "$hereafter \\Remark{CI10}$\n",
       "$, has an upper energy level of E_u = 23.620~K and a critical density of n_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\sim 1.0 \\times 10^{3} \\;\\mathrm{cm^{-3}} (at a temperature of 50~K) \\footnote{n_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\equiv A / \\gamma, where A is the Einstein A coefficient for the transition and \\gamma the rate of collisional de-excitation with hydrogen molecules, with values from \\cite{Schroder1991} as compiled in the Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database (\\citealt{Schoier2005}), \\url{https://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~moldata/}},$\n",
       "$and the^{3}P_{2} \\to  ^{3}P_{1} transition line at 809.34197~GHz has E_u = 62.462~K and n_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\sim 3.4 \\times 10^{3} \\;\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}.$\n",
       "$Therefore, they are easily excited in the cold ISM environment.$\n",
       "$Given the high abundance of carbon in the ISM, \\neutralcarbon, CO and \\ionizedcarbon  are the most powerful cold ISM tracers, and are the most widely used tools to probe cold ISM properties and hence galaxy evolution at cosmological distances.$\n",
       "$The interstellar \\neutralcarbon  is produced from$\n",
       "$the photodissociation of CO molecules by UV photons and the recombination of \\ionizedcarbon , both happening in photodissociation regions (PDRs; \\citealt{Langer1976,deJong1980,Tielens1985a,Tielens1985b,vanDishoeck1986,vanDishoeck1988,Sternberg1989,Sternberg1995,Hollenbach1991,Hollenbach1999,Kaufman1999,Wolfire2010,Madden2020,Bisbas2021}, also see reviews by \\citealt{Genzel1989,Jaffe1985,Hollenbach1997,Wolfire2022}).$\n",
       "$In the simple plane-parallel (i.e., 1-D) PDR model, \\neutralcarbon  exists in a layer where UV photons can penetrate through the molecular gas but cannot maintain a high carbon ionizing rate.$\n",
       "$Such a layer is suggested to have an intermediate gas surface density (N_{\\mathrm{H_2}} \\sim 1 \\textnormal{--} 4 \\times 10^{20} \\;\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}), fairly cold temperature (10 to a few tens K), and moderate visual extinction (A_V \\sim 1 - 4).$\n",
       "$CO molecules dominate the more shielded interior of this layer and \\ionizedcarbon  dominates the exterior.$\n",
       "$Hydrogen molecules are gradually photodissociated to atoms across this layer (A_V \\sim 0.1 - 4).$\n",
       "$This plane-parallel scenario qualitatively explains the layered structure of the Orion Bar PDR in our Galaxy on sub-pc scales (e.g.,  \\citealt{Genzel1989,Tielens1993,Tauber1994,Hogerheijde1995b,Hollenbach1999,Goicoechea2016}), and the \\rho~Ophiuchi~A PDR in a recent study with an unprecedented resolution of 360~AU (\\citealt{Yamagishi2021}), where the interplay between individual young, massive (O, B) stars and the ISM can be directly observed.$\n",
       "$However, such simple models cannot fully explain molecular clouds. Plenty of observations in Galactic molecular clouds, \\ionizedhydrogen  regions and star-formation complexes have revealed a widespread \\neutralcarbon  distribution over most areas of molecular clouds on scales of a few to ten pc, and a relatively high \\neutralcarbon  fractional abundance even at a large A_V depth > 10~mag (\\citealt{Phillips1980,Phillips1981,Wootten1982,Keene1985,Keene1987,Jaffe1985,Zmuidzinas1986,Zmuidzinas1988,Genzel1988,Frerking1989,Plume1994,Plume1999,Gerin1998a,Tatematsu1999,Ikeda1999,Ikeda2002,Yamamoto2001,Zhang2001,Kamegai2003,Oka2004,Izumi2021}).$\n",
       "$This observational evidence actually requires PDRs to be clumpy  (\\citealt{Stutzki1988,Genzel1988,Burton1990,Meixner1993,Spaans1997,Kramer2004,Kramer2008,Pineda2008,Sun2008}), with a volume filling factor much less than unity (e.g., \\sim 0.1 - 0.3; \\citealt{Stutzki1988}), so that$\n",
       "$UV photons can penetrate through most of the cloud, except for the densest clumps.$\n",
       "$Therefore, the spatial co-existence of \\neutralcarbon  and low rotational transition (low-J) CO lines can be well explained by such an inter-clump medium inside the molecular clouds.$\n",
       "$Alternatively, cosmic rays (CRs) have also been proposed to be the reason for the \\neutralcarbon -CO association as they can penetrate much deeper than UV photons into clouds, and thus more uniformly dissociate CO molecules into \\neutralcarbon  inside clouds (\\citealt{Field1969,Padovani2009,Papadopoulos2010c,Ivlev2015,Papadopoulos2018}).$\n",
       "$\\subsection{Variations of the \\CI/\\CO line ratio (\\RCICO) in the literature}$\n",

       "$At individual molecular cloud scales, \\Remark{RCI10CO10} (or column density ratio) seems to vary from \\gtrsim 0.5 (or \\gtrsim 0.2 for column density ratio) to <0.1 with an increasing N_{\\mathrm{H2}} and A_V, e.g., from cloud surface or PDR front to the interior \\citep[e.g.][]{Frerking1982,Genzel1988,Oka2004,Kramer2004,Kramer2008,Mookerjea2006,Sun2008,Yamagishi2021}.$\n",
       "$At sub-galactic scales, when individual clouds are smoothed out, \\Remark{RCI10CO10} is found to lie in a narrower range of \\sim 0.1 \\text{--} 0.3. For example, across the Galactic plane, the ratio is found to change only slightly within a galactocentric radius of 3--7~kpc (\\sim 0.08 \\text{--} 0.12, overall mean = 0.105 \\pm 0.004; \\citealt{Oka2005});$\n",
       "$whereas in the starburst galaxies like M~82 and NGC~253, \\Remark{RCI10CO10} or the [\\CI]/CO abundance ratio is a factor of 3--5 higher than the Galactic value (\\citealt{Schilke1993,White1994b,Krips2016}).$\n",
       "$Recent high-resolution (hundred pc scales) \\Remark{CI10} mapping studies in the nearby spiral galaxy M~83 (\\citealt{Miyamoto2021}) and starburst galaxy IRAS~F18293-3413 (\\citealt{Saito2020}) reported tightly-correlated \\Remark{CI10} and \\Remark{CO10} emission, with scaling relations at hundred parsecs equivalent to$\n",

       "$The discrepant power-law indices reflects different trends in individual galaxies that are not fully understood.$\n",
       "$Meanwhile, in the central \\lesssim 100~pc of NGC~7469 close to the X-ray-luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN), \\RCICO  is found to be substantially enhanced by a factor of >10 (reaching \\Remark{RCI10CO10} \\approx 1; \\citealt{Izumi2020}; see also the Circinus Galaxy's AGN with \\Remark{RCI10CO32} \\approx 0.9 in \\citealt{Izumi2018}).$\n",
       "$Furthermore, in the low-metallicity Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) environments, a factor of 1.5 - 3 \\times higher \\RCICO  values have been found (\\citealt{Bolatto2000b,Bolatto2000c}; see also other low-metallicity galaxies: \\citealt{Bolatto2000a,Hunt2017}).$\n",
       "$These studies indicate that \\RCICO  is sensitive to ISM conditions among and within galaxies.$\n",
       "$However, previous extragalactic studies are mainly focused on starburst galaxies and bright galaxy centres. How \\RCICO  behaves across the disks and spiral arms of typical star-forming galaxies is much less explored. Whether \\CI  can trace the so-called CO-dark molecular gas at a low gas density or metallicity is also still in question.$\n",
       "$Understanding \\RCICO  variation and quantifying the \\CI  and \\CO  excitation in extragalactic environments is now particularly important given the rapidly growing numbers and diverse galactic environments of \\CI  line observations at cosmological distances (e.g., \\citealt{Weiss2003,Weiss2005,Pety2004,Wagg2006,Walter2011,Danielson2011,AlaghbandZadeh2013,Gullberg2016,Bothwell2017,Popping2017,Yang2017,Emonts2018,Valentino2018,Valentino2020,Bourne2019,Nesvadba2019,Dannerbauer2019,Jin2019,Brisbin2019,Boogaard2020,Cortzen2020,Harrington2021,Dunne2021,Lee2021}).$\n",

The total on-source integration time was 30.8~hours. A mosaic with 149 pointings was used to map an area of 94\" \\times 136\" at a position angle of -27^\\circ, which covers the galaxy centre, bar and the majority of the spiral arms, and is about 1/3 of the full PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) map area.$\n",

Region~22 of NGC~3627 and the outer pixels in the two starburst/AGN galaxies make the tips of the blue and gray faint-end tails, respectively. But most of these features should still be spurious.

       "$In Fig.~\\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} we show the non-LTE version of Fig.~\\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}.$\n",
       "$The non-LTE result does not qualitatively differ from that of LTE.$\n",
       "$The most obvious difference is that at high temperature (\\Tkin > 50~K, given our other assumed conditions), the required [\\CI/CO] is lower by \\times 2 for the same observed \\RCICO, whereas at low temperature (\\Tkin \\sim 15~K) a \\lesssim 2 \\times [\\CI/CO] is expected for the observed line ratio.$\n",
       "$As listed in the title of each panel, we assume \\log \\nHtwo / \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} = 2.5 to 3.0 for our conditions (1) to (7).$\n",
       "$This is based on the fact that low-J CO and \\CI  trace the bulk of molecular gas with \\log \\nHtwo / \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} \\sim 2--3 (e.g., \\citealt{Leroy2017,Liudz2021a}), with a typical value \\nHtwo \\sim 300   \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} widely adopted/found for Galactic and nearby galaxy GMCs (e.g., \\citealt{Koda2012,Pety2017}, see also simulations of \\citealt{Glover2012b}), whereas a smaller portion of their emission is from the dense gas with \\log \\nHtwo / \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} \\sim 4--6 (e.g., \\citealt{Gao2004a}).$\n",
       "$The fraction of the dense gas is expected to increase in more starbursting environment (\\citealt{Gao2004b}), so does the mean gas density (\\citealt{Liudz2021a}). Therefore, a \\log \\nHtwo / \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} of 3.0 is perhaps a reasonable assumption, or at least a lower limit for our galaxy centres. A 10 \\times higher density does not qualitatively change Fig.~\\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} except for shifting the expected \\RNCINCO to be 50\\% higher in the \\Tkin > 50~K conditions (making Fig.~\\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} more like Fig.~\\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}).$\n",
       "$Therefore, our non-LTE result strongly confirms the LTE result in the previous section, that the intrinsic \\CI/CO abundance has to vary significantly from about 0.1--0.2 to about 1--3, in order to explain the observed line ratios from Galactic GMCs (hundred pc scales) and NGC~3627/4321 SF disk GMCs to NGC~1808/7469 SB disk/AGN (r \\lesssim 250~pc) environments.$\n",

       "$From this study we see that the line ratio \\RCICO increases from 0.1 to 0.2 and > 0.5 from the SF disk to the SB disk and the vicinity (few hundred pc) of X-ray luminous AGN. Although we may be limited by our sample,$\n",
       "$we suggest that this trend can be extended to general cases at both local and high redshift, because the \\CI/CO abundance ratio enhancement is well-predicted by the CRDR and XDR theories.$\n",
       "$\\citet{Papadopoulos2010c} and \\citet{Papadopoulos2011} pointed out the key role of CRDR in local (U)LIRGs. With UV photons alone, cold gas in starbursting environments can still be well shielded, hence as cold as \\sim 10~K. However, with CRs produced from O, B star clusters and supernova remnants, the gas can be uniformly illuminated and heated up.$\n",
       "$The extremely starbursty local ULIRGs have a CR density (\\xi_{\\mathrm{CR}}) 10^{3}--10^{4} times that of the Milky Way (\\citealt{Papadopoulos2010c}), and thus will naturally dissociate more CO into \\CI .$\n",
       "$\\citet{Bisbas2017} and \\citet{Papadopoulos2018} conducted simulations of molecular gas at tens of pc scale with varying CR strength, and found that when \\xi_{\\mathrm{CR}} is \\sim 1 \\textnormal{--} 100   \\times Galactic value, the gas temperature in the dense gas remains largely unaffected (\\sim 10~K).$\n",
       "$However, when \\xi_{\\mathrm{CR}} reaches \\sim 1000   \\times Galactic value as in (U)LIRGs, the gas temperature increases to 30--50~K. The \\citet{Bisbas2017} simulation also shows that the \\CI  and \\ionizedcarbon  fractional abundances at \\log A_V \\sim 0.5 increase by one and three orders of magnitude, respectively, and the CO fractional abundance decreases correspondingly by over two orders of magnitude, with an increasing \\xi_{\\mathrm{CR}} from the Galactic value to 100   \\times of that.$\n",
       "$These results are in line with our calculations in Sect.~\\ref{subsec: LTE}.$\n",
       "$Meanwhile, the AGN-driven XDR chemistry and molecule/atom excitation have been firstly modeled in great detail by \\citet{Maloney1996}, \\citet{Meijerink2005} and \\citet{Meijerink2007}. In XDRs, photo-ionization becomes the dominant heating source instead of photo-electric emission from dust grains in PDRs, thus more molecules are dissociated and/or ionized. \\citet{Meijerink2005}'s Model~1 shows that CO molecules are fully dissociated when N_{\\mathrm{H}} < 10^{23}   \\mathrm{cm^{-2}}, then the fractional abundance is gradually increased by six orders of magnitudes from N_{\\mathrm{H}} = 10^{23}   \\mathrm{cm^{-2}} to 10^{24}   \\mathrm{cm^{-2}}. By contrast, the \\CI  and \\ionizedcarbon  abundances are about constant until reaching the densest part (N_{\\mathrm{H}} > 10^{24.5}   \\mathrm{cm^{-2}}). Unlike in PDRs, there is no clear \\ionizedcarbon /\\CI /CO stratification in XDRs (\\citealt{Meijerink2007,Wolfire2022}). Their Model~2 with a 100 \\times higher energy deposition rate shows that the CO distribution contracts to the highest gas density spots, and the total cumulative [\\CI/CO] is increased by about 0.2~dex, reaching \\RNCINCO \\sim 1.6.$\n",
       "$This value agrees well with our calculations shown in Figs.~\\ref{fig: LTE RCICO} and \\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} (the ISM condition 7).$\n",
       "$Therefore, both in theoretical and observational views, it is clear that the \\RCICO line ratio is a good indicator of the starburst's CRDR and AGN's XDR.$\n",
       "$If a \\RCICO line ratio (to be specific, \\Remark{ICI10}/\\Remark{ICO21}) reaches 0.2--0.5, then the CRDR plays a crucial role and the abundance ratio [\\CI/CO] could be \\sim 1.$\n",
       "$If it exceeds 0.5--1.0, then it may only be enhanced by an XDR, e.g., caused by an X-ray luminous AGN, which boosts the abundance ratio [\\CI/CO] to \\gtrsim 1--2.$\n",

       "$    This elevated line ratio compared to the SF disk is likely caused by a \\sim 3 \\text{--} 5 \\times increased [\\CI/CO] abundance ratio, based on our LTE and non-LTE calculations and parameter assumptions (Figs.~\\ref{fig: LTE RCICO} and \\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO}).$\n",

       "$After downloading the raw data, i.e., 12m+7m for \\Remark{CO21} and 7m for \\Remark{CI10}, respectively, we ran the observatory calibration pipeline (\"scriptForPI\") to reduce the data.$\n",
       "$As shown in \\citet{Leroy2021pipeline}, the observatory calibration produces well-calibrated visibility data without further manual flagging.$\n",
       "$We then split out the visibility data and proceeded to the imaging step.$\n",
       "$In order to match the spatial resolution of \\Remark{CO21} and \\Remark{CI10}, we carefully matched their uv ranges.$\n",
       "$We flagged the \\Remark{CO21} visibility data outside the uv range of 19--68~m (\\sim15--52k\\lambda) so as to match the uv range of the \\Remark{CI10} data (minimum to 80\\% percentile: 8.9--32~m, or \\sim15--52k\\lambda).$\n",
       "$Given that the \\Remark{CI10} uv plane distribution is elliptic, while the uv range selection in \\incode{CASA} is circular, our chosen thresholds are adjusted to make the final \\Remark{CO21} synthesized beam similar to that of \\Remark{CI10}.$\n",
       "$Note that in a later step we also convolved both image cubes to the exact same rounded beam (3.46\") before generating the moment maps.$\n",
       "$The \\textit{PHANGS-ALMA imaging \\& post-processing pipeline} \\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/akleroy/phangs_imaging_scripts}; version 2.0.} developed by \\citet{Leroy2021pipeline} is used for creating line cubes and moment maps. The code is suitable for general nearby galaxy strong line mapping interferometric and total power mosaic data. In brief, the visibility data are carefully transformed into the user-given channel width and frequency range corresponding to the line plus line-free channels, then continuum is subtracted by fitting an order of zero polynomial. Then, two stages of imaging (\"cleaning\") are performed: first a multi-scale cleaning down to \\sim4\\sigma, then a single-scale cleaning down to \\sim1\\sigma. At each stage, \\incode{CASA}'s \\incode{tclean} task is iteratively called so as to force many major cycles, which has proven to improve the accuracy of the deconvolution. Before and during the second stage cleaning, a clean mask is computed at each iteration according to the outcome of previous iteration by finding all >2\\sigma pixels associated with >4\\sigma peaks in a watershed algorithm (\\citealt{Rosolowsky2006,Rosolowsky2021}). In this way the cleaning can include as much signal as possible and ensure a signal-free residual.$\n",
       "$Then the image cubes are corrected for the primary beam attenuation, converted to Kelvin units, and convolved to a common beam, which is the coarser beam of \\Remark{CO21} and \\Remark{CI10}. Because of our uv range flagging before imaging, the directly \\incode{tclean}-imaged beam sizes are already close. This convolution further precisely matches \\Remark{CO21} and \\Remark{CI10} image cube beams.$\n",
       "$Next, moment maps are generated with modules in the PHANGS-ALMA pipeline, consistently for CO and \\CI . This process includes firstly constructing noise and mask cubes from the image cubes, then combining the masks (i.e., where science signal should present), then computing moment 0 -- line integrated intensity, moment 1 -- line peak velocity, and moment 2 -- line width. The mask cubes are the key in producing moment maps. Here two masks are built: a \"broad mask\" which contains as much plausible science signal as possible, and a \"strict mask\" which is optimized for high-confidence signal. The strict mask is made by finding peaks that have >4\\sigma over two consecutive channels then expanding down to 2\\sigma also with the watershed algorithm. Then the broad mask is obtained by aggregating strict masks made from image cubes convolved to coarser resolutions (\\sim30\" in this work as well as in \\citealt{Leroy2021pipeline}).$\n",
       "$To make consistent moment maps for CO and \\CI , we aggregate their masks together as a joint mask, for broad and strict masks, respectively, then their final moment maps are computed within the joint mask.$\n",
       "$The resulting \\Remark{CO21} and \\Remark{CI10} line intensity maps are then used for our next line ratio analysis. The line velocity and line width maps are not further analyzed, but are consistent with the products from the PHANGS-ALMA survey's data release as well as in \\citet{Lang2020}. Given that the PHANGS-ALMA 12m+7m+tp \\Remark{CO21} has the full spatial information and are deeper, their line velocity and line width maps are more useful for kinematic studies than ours produced from this work.$\n",

       "$We made ratio maps of our uv-trimmed CO(2-1) moment-0 map, and that of the original PHANGS-ALMA short-spacing-corrected (12m+7m+tp) CO(2-1) data but convolved to the corresponding resolution before making the moment maps. The ratio maps are made at two resolutions: the FTS 39\" beam, and our working resolution of 3.46\". The former leads to a missing flux of 26\\%, 31\\% and 36\\% from the galaxy centre to the southern bar end. Note that the above \\textit{Herschel} FTS analysis indicates in general a higher missing flux, but the FTS measurements are of low \\SNR and errors purely from the RMS of the spectra can not fully account for other errors like pointing, spectral response, off-axis spaxel calibration, etc.$\n",
       "$The latter ratio map shows that the missing flux at our working resolution and within the strict mask varies from \\sim60\\% to as low as 6\\% at the brightest pixels. This is consistent with our next method based on simulation.$\n",

       "$After downloading the raw data, i.e., 12m+7m for \\Remark{CO21} and 7m for \\Remark{CI10}, respectively, we ran the observatory calibration pipeline (\"scriptForPI\") to reduce the data.$\n",
       "$As shown in \\citet{Leroy2021pipeline}, the observatory calibration produces well-calibrated visibility data without further manual flagging.$\n",
       "$We then split out the visibility data and proceeded to the imaging step.$\n",
       "$In order to match the spatial resolution of \\Remark{CO21} and \\Remark{CI10}, we carefully matched their uv ranges.$\n",
       "$We flagged the \\Remark{CO21} visibility data outside the uv range of 19--68~m (\\sim15--52k\\lambda) so as to match the uv range of the \\Remark{CI10} data (minimum to 80\\% percentile: 8.9--32~m, or \\sim15--52k\\lambda).$\n",
       "$Given that the \\Remark{CI10} uv plane distribution is elliptic, while the uv range selection in \\incode{CASA} is circular, our chosen thresholds are adjusted to make the final \\Remark{CO21} synthesized beam similar to that of \\Remark{CI10}.$\n",
       "$Note that in a later step we also convolved both image cubes to the exact same rounded beam (3.46\") before generating the moment maps.$\n",
       "$The \\textit{PHANGS-ALMA imaging \\& post-processing pipeline} \\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/akleroy/phangs_imaging_scripts}; version 2.0.} developed by \\citet{Leroy2021pipeline} is used for creating line cubes and moment maps. The code is suitable for general nearby galaxy strong line mapping interferometric and total power mosaic data. In brief, the visibility data are carefully transformed into the user-given channel width and frequency range corresponding to the line plus line-free channels, then continuum is subtracted by fitting an order of zero polynomial. Then, two stages of imaging (\"cleaning\") are performed: first a multi-scale cleaning down to \\sim4\\sigma, then a single-scale cleaning down to \\sim1\\sigma. At each stage, \\incode{CASA}'s \\incode{tclean} task is iteratively called so as to force many major cycles, which has proven to improve the accuracy of the deconvolution. Before and during the second stage cleaning, a clean mask is computed at each iteration according to the outcome of previous iteration by finding all >2\\sigma pixels associated with >4\\sigma peaks in a watershed algorithm (\\citealt{Rosolowsky2006,Rosolowsky2021}). In this way the cleaning can include as much signal as possible and ensure a signal-free residual.$\n",
       "$Then the image cubes are corrected for the primary beam attenuation, converted to Kelvin units, and convolved to a common beam, which is the coarser beam of \\Remark{CO21} and \\Remark{CI10}. Because of our uv range flagging before imaging, the directly \\incode{tclean}-imaged beam sizes are already close. This convolution further precisely matches \\Remark{CO21} and \\Remark{CI10} image cube beams.$\n",
       "$Next, moment maps are generated with modules in the PHANGS-ALMA pipeline, consistently for CO and \\CI . This process includes firstly constructing noise and mask cubes from the image cubes, then combining the masks (i.e., where science signal should present), then computing moment 0 -- line integrated intensity, moment 1 -- line peak velocity, and moment 2 -- line width. The mask cubes are the key in producing moment maps. Here two masks are built: a \"broad mask\" which contains as much plausible science signal as possible, and a \"strict mask\" which is optimized for high-confidence signal. The strict mask is made by finding peaks that have >4\\sigma over two consecutive channels then expanding down to 2\\sigma also with the watershed algorithm. Then the broad mask is obtained by aggregating strict masks made from image cubes convolved to coarser resolutions (\\sim30\" in this work as well as in \\citealt{Leroy2021pipeline}).$\n",
       "$To make consistent moment maps for CO and \\CI , we aggregate their masks together as a joint mask, for broad and strict masks, respectively, then their final moment maps are computed within the joint mask.$\n",
       "$The resulting \\Remark{CO21} and \\Remark{CI10} line intensity maps are then used for our next line ratio analysis. The line velocity and line width maps are not further analyzed, but are consistent with the products from the PHANGS-ALMA survey's data release as well as in \\citet{Lang2020}. Given that the PHANGS-ALMA 12m+7m+tp \\Remark{CO21} has the full spatial information and are deeper, their line velocity and line width maps are more useful for kinematic studies than ours produced from this work.$\n",

       "$\\label{appendix: missing flux}$\n",
       "$We assess the level of missing flux in the NGC~3627 \\CI  data in three ways:$\n",
       "$(a) comparing with the \\textit{Herschel} SPIRE FTS \\Remark{CI10} observation in this galaxy,$\n",
       "$(b) comparing the uv-trimmed CO(2-1) moment-0 map with the PHANGS-ALMA short-spacing corrected (12m+7m+tp) moment-0 map,$\n",
       "$and (c) performing CASA simulation and comparing with the \"true\" moment-0 from the skymodel and the derived product from the simulated visibilities.$\n",
       "$Method (a):$\n",
       "$NGC~3627 has been observed with the \\textit{Herschel} SPIRE (\\citealt{Griffin2010}) Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS; \\citealt{Naylor2010}) in mapping mode with nearly Nyquist sampling.$\n",
       "$\\cite{Liudz2015} reduced the archival data and extracted the line fluxes for each groups of pointings. \\Remark{CI10} is detected with \\SNR\\sim4-5 at three sightlines from the galaxy centre to the southern bar end, with R.A. and Dec. coordinates (J2000) 170.061905, +12.991336, 170.066361 +12.987091, and 170.071243 +12.981615, respectively. The \\Remark{CI10} luminosities are 1.44 \\pm 0.31, 2.01 \\pm 0.48, and 1.71 \\pm 0.40 \\times 10^{7} \\; \\mathrm{K km s^{-1} pc^{2}}, respectively, where the errors are purely from the RMS of line-free FTS spectra. By convolving our \\Remark{CI10} line cube to the FTS beam of \\sim39\" then extracting the moment maps, we measure a \\Remark{CI10} line luminosity of 0.52, 0.33 and 0.29 \\times 10^{7} \\; \\mathrm{K km s^{-1} pc^{2}} at the above three positions, respectively, which means a missing flux of 36-75\\% at the galaxy centre and 68-88\\% at the southern bar end (at a 95\\% confidence level).$\n",
       "$Method (b):$\n",
       "$We made ratio maps of our uv-trimmed CO(2-1) moment-0 map, and that of the original PHANGS-ALMA short-spacing-corrected (12m+7m+tp) CO(2-1) data but convolved to the corresponding resolution before making the moment maps. The ratio maps are made at two resolutions: the FTS 39\" beam, and our working resolution of 3.46\". The former leads to a missing flux of 26\\%, 31\\% and 36\\% from the galaxy centre to the southern bar end. Note that the above \\textit{Herschel} FTS analysis indicates in general a higher missing flux, but the FTS measurements are of low \\SNR and errors purely from the RMS of the spectra can not fully account for other errors like pointing, spectral response, off-axis spaxel calibration, etc.$\n",
       "$The latter ratio map shows that the missing flux at our working resolution and within the strict mask varies from \\sim60\\% to as low as 6\\% at the brightest pixels. This is consistent with our next method based on simulation.$\n",
       "$Method (c):$\n",
       "$We performed detailed simulations of 7m-only \\Remark{CI10} and 12m+7m \\Remark{CO21} observations with the \\incode{CASA} \\incode{simobserve} task.

       "$Note that we do not use the short-spacing-corrected PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) cube because it has a finite beam size of \\sim1\", and simulation based on that may result in more extended emissions. On the contrary, the clean model cube has an infinite resolution, and because both \"multiscale\" and \"singlescale\" cleaning are used in the PHANGS-ALMA imaging, the clean model contains point as well as extended sources.$\n",

       "$Neutral atomic carbon (C^0 or $\\neutralcarbon$) is an important phase of carbon in the interstellar medium (ISM) besides ionized carbon (C^+ or $\\ion$izedcarbon) and carbon monoxide (CO).$\n",
       "$Its ^{3}P state is split into three fine-structure levels. The^{3}P_{1} \\to  ^{3}P_{0} transition line at 492.16065~GHz,$\n",

       "$and the^{3}P_{2} \\to  ^{3}P_{1} transition line at 809.34197~GHz has E_u = 62.462~K and n_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\sim 3.4 \\times 10^{3} \\;\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}.$\n",
       "$Therefore, they are easily excited in the cold ISM environment.$\n",
       "$Given the high abundance of carbon in the ISM, $\\neutralcarbon$, CO and $\\ion$izedcarbon  are the most powerful cold ISM tracers, and are the most widely used tools to probe cold ISM properties and hence galaxy evolution at cosmological distances.$\n",
       "$The interstellar $\\neutralcarbon$  is produced from$\n",
       "$the photodissociation of CO molecules by UV photons and the recombination of $\\ion$izedcarbon , both happening in photodissociation regions (PDRs; \\citealt{Langer1976,deJong1980,Tielens1985a,Tielens1985b,vanDishoeck1986,vanDishoeck1988,Sternberg1989,Sternberg1995,Hollenbach1991,Hollenbach1999,Kaufman1999,Wolfire2010,Madden2020,Bisbas2021}, also see reviews by \\citealt{Genzel1989,Jaffe1985,Hollenbach1997,Wolfire2022}).$\n",
       "$In the simple plane-parallel (i.e., 1-D) PDR model, $\\neutralcarbon$  exists in a layer where UV photons can penetrate through the molecular gas but cannot maintain a high carbon ionizing rate.$\n",
       "$Such a layer is suggested to have an intermediate gas surface density (N_{\\mathrm{H_2}} \\sim 1 \\textnormal{--} 4 \\times 10^{20} \\;\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}), fairly cold temperature (10 to a few tens K), and moderate visual extinction (A_V \\sim 1 - 4).$\n",
       "$CO molecules dominate the more shielded interior of this layer and $\\ion$izedcarbon  dominates the exterior.$\n",

Region~22 of NGC~3627 and the outer pixels in the two starburst/AGN galaxies make the tips of the blue and gray faint-end tails, respectively. But most of these features should still be spurious.

       "$In Fig.~\\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} we show the non-LTE version of Fig.~\\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}.$\n",
       "$The non-LTE result does not qualitatively differ from that of LTE.$\n",
       "$The most obvious difference is that at high temperature (\\Tkin > 50~K, given our other assumed conditions), the required [$\\CI$/CO] is lower by \\times 2 for the same observed \\RCICO, whereas at low temperature (\\Tkin \\sim 15~K) a \\lesssim 2 \\times [$\\CI$/CO] is expected for the observed line ratio.$\n",
       "$As listed in the title of each panel, we assume \\log \\nHtwo / \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} = 2.5 to 3.0 for our conditions (1) to (7).$\n",
       "$This is based on the fact that low-J CO and $\\CI$  trace the bulk of molecular gas with \\log \\nHtwo / \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} \\sim 2--3 (e.g., \\citealt{Leroy2017,Liudz2021a}), with a typical value \\nHtwo \\sim 300   \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} widely adopted/found for Galactic and nearby galaxy GMCs (e.g., \\citealt{Koda2012,Pety2017}, see also simulations of \\citealt{Glover2012b}), whereas a smaller portion of their emission is from the dense gas with \\log \\nHtwo / \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} \\sim 4--6 (e.g., \\citealt{Gao2004a}).$\n",
       "$The fraction of the dense gas is expected to increase in more starbursting environment (\\citealt{Gao2004b}), so does the mean gas density (\\citealt{Liudz2021a}). Therefore, a \\log \\nHtwo / \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} of 3.0 is perhaps a reasonable assumption, or at least a lower limit for our galaxy centres. A 10 \\times higher density does not qualitatively change Fig.~\\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} except for shifting the expected \\RNCINCO to be 50\\% higher in the \\Tkin > 50~K conditions (making Fig.~\\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} more like Fig.~\\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}).$\n",
       "$Therefore, our non-LTE result strongly confirms the LTE result in the previous section, that the intrinsic $\\CI$/CO abundance has to vary significantly from about 0.1--0.2 to about 1--3, in order to explain the observed line ratios from Galactic GMCs (hundred pc scales) and NGC~3627/4321 SF disk GMCs to NGC~1808/7469 SB disk/AGN (r \\lesssim 250~pc) environments.$\n",

       "$From this study we see that the line ratio \\RCICO increases from 0.1 to 0.2 and > 0.5 from the SF disk to the SB disk and the vicinity (few hundred pc) of X-ray luminous AGN. Although we may be limited by our sample,$\n",
       "$we suggest that this trend can be extended to general cases at both local and high redshift, because the $\\CI$/CO abundance ratio enhancement is well-predicted by the CRDR and XDR theories.$\n",
       "$\\citet{Papadopoulos2010c} and \\citet{Papadopoulos2011} pointed out the key role of CRDR in local (U)LIRGs. With UV photons alone, cold gas in starbursting environments can still be well shielded, hence as cold as \\sim 10~K. However, with CRs produced from O, B star clusters and supernova remnants, the gas can be uniformly illuminated and heated up.$\n",
       "$The extremely starbursty local ULIRGs have a CR density (\\xi_{\\mathrm{CR}}) 10^{3}--10^{4} times that of the Milky Way (\\citealt{Papadopoulos2010c}), and thus will naturally dissociate more CO into $\\CI$ .$\n",
       "$\\citet{Bisbas2017} and \\citet{Papadopoulos2018} conducted simulations of molecular gas at tens of pc scale with varying CR strength, and found that when \\xi_{\\mathrm{CR}} is \\sim 1 \\textnormal{--} 100   \\times Galactic value, the gas temperature in the dense gas remains largely unaffected (\\sim 10~K).$\n",
       "$However, when \\xi_{\\mathrm{CR}} reaches \\sim 1000   \\times Galactic value as in (U)LIRGs, the gas temperature increases to 30--50~K. The \\citet{Bisbas2017} simulation also shows that the $\\CI$  and $\\ion$izedcarbon  fractional abundances at \\log A_V \\sim 0.5 increase by one and three orders of magnitude, respectively, and the CO fractional abundance decreases correspondingly by over two orders of magnitude, with an increasing \\xi_{\\mathrm{CR}} from the Galactic value to 100   \\times of that.$\n",
       "$These results are in line with our calculations in Sect.~\\ref{subsec: LTE}.$\n",
       "$Meanwhile, the AGN-driven XDR chemistry and molecule/atom excitation have been firstly modeled in great detail by \\citet{Maloney1996}, \\citet{Meijerink2005} and \\citet{Meijerink2007}. In XDRs, photo-ionization becomes the dominant heating source instead of photo-electric emission from dust grains in PDRs, thus more molecules are dissociated and/or ionized. \\citet{Meijerink2005}'s Model~1 shows that CO molecules are fully dissociated when N_{\\mathrm{H}} < 10^{23}   \\mathrm{cm^{-2}}, then the fractional abundance is gradually increased by six orders of magnitudes from N_{\\mathrm{H}} = 10^{23}   \\mathrm{cm^{-2}} to 10^{24}   \\mathrm{cm^{-2}}. By contrast, the $\\CI$  and $\\ion$izedcarbon  abundances are about constant until reaching the densest part (N_{\\mathrm{H}} > 10^{24.5}   \\mathrm{cm^{-2}}). Unlike in PDRs, there is no clear $\\ion$izedcarbon /$\\CI$ /CO stratification in XDRs (\\citealt{Meijerink2007,Wolfire2022}). Their Model~2 with a 100 \\times higher energy deposition rate shows that the CO distribution contracts to the highest gas density spots, and the total cumulative [$\\CI$/CO] is increased by about 0.2~dex, reaching \\RNCINCO \\sim 1.6.$\n",
       "$This value agrees well with our calculations shown in Figs.~\\ref{fig: LTE RCICO} and \\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} (the ISM condition 7).$\n",
       "$Therefore, both in theoretical and observational views, it is clear that the \\RCICO line ratio is a good indicator of the starburst's CRDR and AGN's XDR.$\n",
       "$If a \\RCICO line ratio (to be specific, $\\Remark${ICI10}/$\\Remark${ICO21}) reaches 0.2--0.5, then the CRDR plays a crucial role and the abundance ratio [$\\CI$/CO] could be \\sim 1.$\n",
       "$If it exceeds 0.5--1.0, then it may only be enhanced by an XDR, e.g., caused by an X-ray luminous AGN, which boosts the abundance ratio [$\\CI$/CO] to \\gtrsim 1--2.$\n",

       "$Neutral atomic carbon (C^0 or $\\neutralcarbon$) is an important phase of carbon in the interstellar medium (ISM) besides ionized carbon (C^+ or $\\ion$izedcarbon) and carbon monoxide (CO).$\n",
       "$Its ^{3}P state is split into three fine-structure levels. The^{3}P_{1} \\to  ^{3}P_{0} transition line at 492.16065~GHz,$\n",
       "$hereafter $\\Remark${CI10}$\n",
       "$, has an upper energy level of E_u = 23.620~K and a critical density of n_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\sim 1.0 \\times 10^{3} \\;\\mathrm{cm^{-3}} (at a temperature of 50~K) \\footnote{n_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\equiv A / \\gamma, where A is the Einstein A coefficient for the transition and \\gamma the rate of collisional de-excitation with hydrogen molecules, with values from \\cite{Schroder1991} as compiled in the Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database (\\citealt{Schoier2005}), \\url{https://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~moldata/}},$\n",
       "$and the^{3}P_{2} \\to  ^{3}P_{1} transition line at 809.34197~GHz has E_u = 62.462~K and n_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\sim 3.4 \\times 10^{3} \\;\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}.$\n",
       "$Therefore, they are easily excited in the cold ISM environment.$\n",
       "$Given the high abundance of carbon in the ISM, $\\neutralcarbon$, CO and $\\ion$izedcarbon  are the most powerful cold ISM tracers, and are the most widely used tools to probe cold ISM properties and hence galaxy evolution at cosmological distances.$\n",
       "$The interstellar $\\neutralcarbon$  is produced from$\n",
       "$the photodissociation of CO molecules by UV photons and the recombination of $\\ion$izedcarbon , both happening in photodissociation regions (PDRs; \\citealt{Langer1976,deJong1980,Tielens1985a,Tielens1985b,vanDishoeck1986,vanDishoeck1988,Sternberg1989,Sternberg1995,Hollenbach1991,Hollenbach1999,Kaufman1999,Wolfire2010,Madden2020,Bisbas2021}, also see reviews by \\citealt{Genzel1989,Jaffe1985,Hollenbach1997,Wolfire2022}).$\n",
       "$In the simple plane-parallel (i.e., 1-D) PDR model, $\\neutralcarbon$  exists in a layer where UV photons can penetrate through the molecular gas but cannot maintain a high carbon ionizing rate.$\n",
       "$Such a layer is suggested to have an intermediate gas surface density (N_{\\mathrm{H_2}} \\sim 1 \\textnormal{--} 4 \\times 10^{20} \\;\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}), fairly cold temperature (10 to a few tens K), and moderate visual extinction (A_V \\sim 1 - 4).$\n",
       "$CO molecules dominate the more shielded interior of this layer and $\\ion$izedcarbon  dominates the exterior.$\n",
       "$Hydrogen molecules are gradually photodissociated to atoms across this layer (A_V \\sim 0.1 - 4).$\n",
       "$This plane-parallel scenario qualitatively explains the layered structure of the Orion Bar PDR in our Galaxy on sub-pc scales (e.g.,  \\citealt{Genzel1989,Tielens1993,Tauber1994,Hogerheijde1995b,Hollenbach1999,Goicoechea2016}), and the \\rho~Ophiuchi~A PDR in a recent study with an unprecedented resolution of 360~AU (\\citealt{Yamagishi2021}), where the interplay between individual young, massive (O, B) stars and the ISM can be directly observed.$\n",
       "$However, such simple models cannot fully explain molecular clouds. Plenty of observations in Galactic molecular clouds, $\\ion$izedhydrogen  regions and star-formation complexes have revealed a widespread $\\neutralcarbon$  distribution over most areas of molecular clouds on scales of a few to ten pc, and a relatively high $\\neutralcarbon$  fractional abundance even at a large A_V depth > 10~mag (\\citealt{Phillips1980,Phillips1981,Wootten1982,Keene1985,Keene1987,Jaffe1985,Zmuidzinas1986,Zmuidzinas1988,Genzel1988,Frerking1989,Plume1994,Plume1999,Gerin1998a,Tatematsu1999,Ikeda1999,Ikeda2002,Yamamoto2001,Zhang2001,Kamegai2003,Oka2004,Izumi2021}).$\n",
       "$This observational evidence actually requires PDRs to be clumpy  (\\citealt{Stutzki1988,Genzel1988,Burton1990,Meixner1993,Spaans1997,Kramer2004,Kramer2008,Pineda2008,Sun2008}), with a volume filling factor much less than unity (e.g., \\sim 0.1 - 0.3; \\citealt{Stutzki1988}), so that$\n",
       "$UV photons can penetrate through most of the cloud, except for the densest clumps.$\n",
       "$Therefore, the spatial co-existence of $\\neutralcarbon$  and low rotational transition (low-J) CO lines can be well explained by such an inter-clump medium inside the molecular clouds.$\n",
       "$Alternatively, cosmic rays (CRs) have also been proposed to be the reason for the $\\neutralcarbon$ -CO association as they can penetrate much deeper than UV photons into clouds, and thus more uniformly dissociate CO molecules into $\\neutralcarbon$  inside clouds (\\citealt{Field1969,Padovani2009,Papadopoulos2010c,Ivlev2015,Papadopoulos2018}).$\n",

       "$At individual molecular cloud scales, $\\Remark${RCI10CO10} (or column density ratio) seems to vary from \\gtrsim 0.5 (or \\gtrsim 0.2 for column density ratio) to <0.1 with an increasing N_{\\mathrm{H2}} and A_V, e.g., from cloud surface or PDR front to the interior \\citep[e.g.][]{Frerking1982,Genzel1988,Oka2004,Kramer2004,Kramer2008,Mookerjea2006,Sun2008,Yamagishi2021}.$\n",
       "$At sub-galactic scales, when individual clouds are smoothed out, $\\Remark${RCI10CO10} is found to lie in a narrower range of \\sim 0.1 \\text{--} 0.3. For example, across the Galactic plane, the ratio is found to change only slightly within a galactocentric radius of 3--7~kpc (\\sim 0.08 \\text{--} 0.12, overall mean = 0.105 \\pm 0.004; \\citealt{Oka2005});$\n",
       "$whereas in the starburst galaxies like M~82 and NGC~253, $\\Remark${RCI10CO10} or the [$\\CI$]/CO abundance ratio is a factor of 3--5 higher than the Galactic value (\\citealt{Schilke1993,White1994b,Krips2016}).$\n",
       "$Recent high-resolution (hundred pc scales) $\\Remark${CI10} mapping studies in the nearby spiral galaxy M~83 (\\citealt{Miyamoto2021}) and starburst galaxy IRAS~F18293-3413 (\\citealt{Saito2020}) reported tightly-correlated $\\Remark${CI10} and $\\Remark${CO10} emission, with scaling relations at hundred parsecs equivalent to$\n",

       "$Furthermore, in the low-metallicity Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) environments, a factor of 1.5 - 3 \\times higher \\RCICO  values have been found (\\citealt{Bolatto2000b,Bolatto2000c}; see also other low-metallicity galaxies: \\citealt{Bolatto2000a,Hunt2017}).$\n",

       "$Does the \\RCICO  line ratio vary significantly across galaxy disks?$\n",

       "$Currently, high-resolution (hundreds of parsec scale) imaging/mapping of $\\CI$  in nearby galaxies relies on radio telescopes at high altitudes, e.g., the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE, 10-m single-dish), Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX, 12-m single-dish), and is limited to the available weather conditions corresponding to the high frequency of $\\CI$  lines.

A mosaic with 149 pointings was used to map an area of 94\" \\times 136\" at a position angle of -27^\\circ, which covers the galaxy centre, bar and the majority of the spiral arms, and is about 1/3 of the full PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) map area.$\n",

       "$This correlation slope is likely to change with different CO transitions due to the CO excitation's dependence on the CO luminosity or star formation rate themselves (e.g., \\citealt{Daddi2015,Liudz2021a}).$\n",

Region~22 of NGC~3627 and the outer pixels in the two starburst/AGN galaxies make the tips of the blue and gray faint-end tails, respectively. But most of these features should still be spurious. We performed CASA simulations following the real observations of NGC~3627 to verify what we would get if \\RCICO  were constant across the galaxies (Appendix~\\ref{appendix: simulation})$\n",

       "$with the Large Velocity Gradient (LVG; i.e., expanding sphere) escape probability (\\citealt{Scoville1974,Goldreich1974}).$\n",
       "$Comparing to LTE, the volume density of H_2 is now an additional property that plays a role. The excitation temperature of each line no longer equals \\Tkin.$\n",
       "$We compute the non-LTE line ratios in a grid of ( \\Tkin,   \\dv,   $\\CO$abundance,   \\RNCINCO,   $\\CO$columndensity,   \\nHtwo ) parameter sets, then study the line and abundance ratios similarly as in the previous section.$\n",
       "$In Fig.~\\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} we show the non-LTE version of Fig.~\\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}.$\n",
       "$The non-LTE result does not qualitatively differ from that of LTE.$\n",
       "$The most obvious difference is that at high temperature (\\Tkin > 50~K, given our other assumed conditions), the required [$\\CI$/CO] is lower by \\times 2 for the same observed \\RCICO, whereas at low temperature (\\Tkin \\sim 15~K) a \\lesssim 2 \\times [$\\CI$/CO] is expected for the observed line ratio.$\n",
       "$As listed in the title of each panel, we assume \\log \\nHtwo / \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} = 2.5 to 3.0 for our conditions (1) to (7).$\n",
       "$This is based on the fact that low-J CO and $\\CI$  trace the bulk of molecular gas with \\log \\nHtwo / \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} \\sim 2--3 (e.g., \\citealt{Leroy2017,Liudz2021a}), with a typical value \\nHtwo \\sim 300   \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} widely adopted/found for Galactic and nearby galaxy GMCs (e.g., \\citealt{Koda2012,Pety2017}, see also simulations of \\citealt{Glover2012b}), whereas a smaller portion of their emission is from the dense gas with \\log \\nHtwo / \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} \\sim 4--6 (e.g., \\citealt{Gao2004a}).$\n",
       "$The fraction of the dense gas is expected to increase in more starbursting environment (\\citealt{Gao2004b}), so does the mean gas density (\\citealt{Liudz2021a}). Therefore, a \\log \\nHtwo / \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} of 3.0 is perhaps a reasonable assumption, or at least a lower limit for our galaxy centres. A 10 \\times higher density does not qualitatively change Fig.~\\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} except for shifting the expected \\RNCINCO to be 50\\% higher in the \\Tkin > 50~K conditions (making Fig.~\\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} more like Fig.~\\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}).$\n",
       "$Therefore, our non-LTE result strongly confirms the LTE result in the previous section, that the intrinsic $\\CI$/CO abundance has to vary significantly from about 0.1--0.2 to about 1--3, in order to explain the observed line ratios from Galactic GMCs (hundred pc scales) and NGC~3627/4321 SF disk GMCs to NGC~1808/7469 SB disk/AGN (r \\lesssim 250~pc) environments.$\n",

       "$\\section{Discussion}$\n",
       "$\\label{sec: Discussion}$\n",
       "$From this study we see that the line ratio \\RCICO increases from 0.1 to 0.2 and > 0.5 from the SF disk to the SB disk and the vicinity (few hundred pc) of X-ray luminous AGN. Although we may be limited by our sample,$\n",
       "$we suggest that this trend can be extended to general cases at both local and high redshift, because the $\\CI$/CO abundance ratio enhancement is well-predicted by the CRDR and XDR theories.$\n",
       "$\\citet{Papadopoulos2010c} and \\citet{Papadopoulos2011} pointed out the key role of CRDR in local (U)LIRGs. With UV photons alone, cold gas in starbursting environments can still be well shielded, hence as cold as \\sim 10~K. However, with CRs produced from O, B star clusters and supernova remnants, the gas can be uniformly illuminated and heated up.$\n",
       "$The extremely starbursty local ULIRGs have a CR density (\\xi_{\\mathrm{CR}}) 10^{3}--10^{4} times that of the Milky Way (\\citealt{Papadopoulos2010c}), and thus will naturally dissociate more CO into $\\CI$ .$\n",
       "$\\citet{Bisbas2017} and \\citet{Papadopoulos2018} conducted simulations of molecular gas at tens of pc scale with varying CR strength, and found that when \\xi_{\\mathrm{CR}} is \\sim 1 \\textnormal{--} 100   \\times Galactic value, the gas temperature in the dense gas remains largely unaffected (\\sim 10~K).$\n",
       "$However, when \\xi_{\\mathrm{CR}} reaches \\sim 1000   \\times Galactic value as in (U)LIRGs, the gas temperature increases to 30--50~K. The \\citet{Bisbas2017} simulation also shows that the $\\CI$  and $\\ion$izedcarbon  fractional abundances at \\log A_V \\sim 0.5 increase by one and three orders of magnitude, respectively, and the CO fractional abundance decreases correspondingly by over two orders of magnitude, with an increasing \\xi_{\\mathrm{CR}} from the Galactic value to 100   \\times of that.$\n",
       "$These results are in line with our calculations in Sect.~\\ref{subsec: LTE}.$\n",
       "$Meanwhile, the AGN-driven XDR chemistry and molecule/atom excitation have been firstly modeled in great detail by \\citet{Maloney1996}, \\citet{Meijerink2005} and \\citet{Meijerink2007}. In XDRs, photo-ionization becomes the dominant heating source instead of photo-electric emission from dust grains in PDRs, thus more molecules are dissociated and/or ionized. \\citet{Meijerink2005}'s Model~1 shows that CO molecules are fully dissociated when N_{\\mathrm{H}} < 10^{23}   \\mathrm{cm^{-2}}, then the fractional abundance is gradually increased by six orders of magnitudes from N_{\\mathrm{H}} = 10^{23}   \\mathrm{cm^{-2}} to 10^{24}   \\mathrm{cm^{-2}}. By contrast, the $\\CI$  and $\\ion$izedcarbon  abundances are about constant until reaching the densest part (N_{\\mathrm{H}} > 10^{24.5}   \\mathrm{cm^{-2}}). Unlike in PDRs, there is no clear $\\ion$izedcarbon /$\\CI$ /CO stratification in XDRs (\\citealt{Meijerink2007,Wolfire2022}). Their Model~2 with a 100 \\times higher energy deposition rate shows that the CO distribution contracts to the highest gas density spots, and the total cumulative [$\\CI$/CO] is increased by about 0.2~dex, reaching \\RNCINCO \\sim 1.6.$\n",
       "$This value agrees well with our calculations shown in Figs.~\\ref{fig: LTE RCICO} and \\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} (the ISM condition 7).$\n",
       "$Therefore, both in theoretical and observational views, it is clear that the \\RCICO line ratio is a good indicator of the starburst's CRDR and AGN's XDR.$\n",
       "$If a \\RCICO line ratio (to be specific, $\\Remark${ICI10}/$\\Remark${ICO21}) reaches 0.2--0.5, then the CRDR plays a crucial role and the abundance ratio [$\\CI$/CO] could be \\sim 1.$\n",
       "$If it exceeds 0.5--1.0, then it may only be enhanced by an XDR, e.g., caused by an X-ray luminous AGN, which boosts the abundance ratio [$\\CI$/CO] to \\gtrsim 1--2.$\n",

       "$Together, we studied the spatial distributions of $\\CI$  and CO, and their line ratio \\RCICO as functions of various galaxy resolved properties, including CO brightness (Fig.~\\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO}), ISRF \\Umean (Fig.~\\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}), and metallicity (Fig.~\\ref{fig: line ratio vs metallicity}).$\n",

       "$    This elevated line ratio compared to the SF disk is likely caused by a \\sim 3 \\text{--} 5 \\times increased [$\\CI$/CO] abundance ratio, based on our LTE and non-LTE calculations and parameter assumptions (Figs.~\\ref{fig: LTE RCICO} and \\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO}).$\n",
       "$    \\item The centres (r \\lesssim 250~pc) of NGC~4321, NGC~3627, NGC~1808 and NGC~7469 show a strongly increasing trend in $\\Remark${RCI10CO21}, from 0.05 to 0.5, as a function of I_{$\\Remark${CO21}} --- i.e., $\\Remark${RCI10CO21} \\approx 0.035   (I_{$\\Remark${CO21}}/[100\\;$\\Kkms$])^{0.8}.$\n",
       "$    The inferred [$\\CI$/CO] abundance ratio from our non-LTE calculation changes from \\sim 0.2 to \\sim 3, in line with the increasing X-ray luminosity of the centres/AGNs.$\n",
       "$    \\item The observed \\RCICO versus ISRF trend is fairly flat, i.e., \\RCICO  is insensitive to ISRF intensity changes, similar to the PDR model prediction calculated with PDRToolbox (although our resolution is much coarser than the physical scale of PDR models; Sect.~\\ref{subsection: ISRF}).$\n",
       "$    \\item We find a \\RCICO versus metallicity trend consistent with previous observations that covered lower-metallicity environments (\\sim 0.2   \\mathrm{Z_{\\odot}}; \\citealt{Bolatto2000b}), within the metallicity range (\\sim 0.7 \\text{--} 1   \\mathrm{Z_{\\odot}}) of our sample (Sect.~\\ref{subsec: metallicity}).$\n",

       "$After downloading the raw data, i.e., 12m+7m for $\\Remark${CO21} and 7m for $\\Remark${CI10}, respectively, we ran the observatory calibration pipeline (\"scriptForPI\") to reduce the data.$\n",
       "$As shown in \\citet{Leroy2021pipeline}, the observatory calibration produces well-calibrated visibility data without further manual flagging.$\n",
       "$We then split out the visibility data and proceeded to the imaging step.$\n",
       "$In order to match the spatial resolution of $\\Remark${CO21} and $\\Remark${CI10}, we carefully matched their uv ranges.$\n",
       "$We flagged the $\\Remark${CO21} visibility data outside the uv range of 19--68~m (\\sim15--52k\\lambda) so as to match the uv range of the $\\Remark${CI10} data (minimum to 80\\% percentile: 8.9--32~m, or \\sim15--52k\\lambda).$\n",
       "$Given that the $\\Remark${CI10} uv plane distribution is elliptic, while the uv range selection in $\\incode${CASA} is circular, our chosen thresholds are adjusted to make the final $\\Remark${CO21} synthesized beam similar to that of $\\Remark${CI10}.$\n",
       "$Note that in a later step we also convolved both image cubes to the exact same rounded beam (3.46\") before generating the moment maps.$\n",
       "$The \\textit{PHANGS-ALMA imaging \\& post-processing pipeline} \\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/akleroy/phangs_imaging_scripts}; version 2.0.} developed by \\citet{Leroy2021pipeline} is used for creating line cubes and moment maps. The code is suitable for general nearby galaxy strong line mapping interferometric and total power mosaic data. In brief, the visibility data are carefully transformed into the user-given channel width and frequency range corresponding to the line plus line-free channels, then continuum is subtracted by fitting an order of zero polynomial. Then, two stages of imaging (\"cleaning\") are performed: first a multi-scale cleaning down to \\sim4\\sigma, then a single-scale cleaning down to \\sim1\\sigma. At each stage, $\\incode${CASA}'s $\\incode${tclean} task is iteratively called so as to force many major cycles, which has proven to improve the accuracy of the deconvolution. Before and during the second stage cleaning, a clean mask is computed at each iteration according to the outcome of previous iteration by finding all >2\\sigma pixels associated with >4\\sigma peaks in a watershed algorithm (\\citealt{Rosolowsky2006,Rosolowsky2021}). In this way the cleaning can include as much signal as possible and ensure a signal-free residual.$\n",
       "$Then the image cubes are corrected for the primary beam attenuation, converted to Kelvin units, and convolved to a common beam, which is the coarser beam of $\\Remark${CO21} and $\\Remark${CI10}. Because of our uv range flagging before imaging, the directly $\\incode${tclean}-imaged beam sizes are already close. This convolution further precisely matches $\\Remark${CO21} and $\\Remark${CI10} image cube beams.$\n",
       "$Next, moment maps are generated with modules in the PHANGS-ALMA pipeline, consistently for CO and $\\CI$ . This process includes firstly constructing noise and mask cubes from the image cubes, then combining the masks (i.e., where science signal should present), then computing moment 0 -- line integrated intensity, moment 1 -- line peak velocity, and moment 2 -- line width. The mask cubes are the key in producing moment maps. Here two masks are built: a \"broad mask\" which contains as much plausible science signal as possible, and a \"strict mask\" which is optimized for high-confidence signal. The strict mask is made by finding peaks that have >4\\sigma over two consecutive channels then expanding down to 2\\sigma also with the watershed algorithm. Then the broad mask is obtained by aggregating strict masks made from image cubes convolved to coarser resolutions (\\sim30\" in this work as well as in \\citealt{Leroy2021pipeline}).$\n",
       "$To make consistent moment maps for CO and $\\CI$ , we aggregate their masks together as a joint mask, for broad and strict masks, respectively, then their final moment maps are computed within the joint mask.$\n",
       "$The resulting $\\Remark${CO21} and $\\Remark${CI10} line intensity maps are then used for our next line ratio analysis. The line velocity and line width maps are not further analyzed, but are consistent with the products from the PHANGS-ALMA survey's data release as well as in \\citet{Lang2020}. Given that the PHANGS-ALMA 12m+7m+tp $\\Remark${CO21} has the full spatial information and are deeper, their line velocity and line width maps are more useful for kinematic studies than ours produced from this work.$\n",

       "$After downloading the raw data, i.e., 12m+7m for $\\Remark${CO21} and 7m for $\\Remark${CI10}, respectively, we ran the observatory calibration pipeline (\"scriptForPI\") to reduce the data.$\n",
       "$As shown in \\citet{Leroy2021pipeline}, the observatory calibration produces well-calibrated visibility data without further manual flagging.$\n",
       "$We then split out the visibility data and proceeded to the imaging step.$\n",
       "$In order to match the spatial resolution of $\\Remark${CO21} and $\\Remark${CI10}, we carefully matched their uv ranges.$\n",
       "$We flagged the $\\Remark${CO21} visibility data outside the uv range of 19--68~m (\\sim15--52k\\lambda) so as to match the uv range of the $\\Remark${CI10} data (minimum to 80\\% percentile: 8.9--32~m, or \\sim15--52k\\lambda).$\n",
       "$Given that the $\\Remark${CI10} uv plane distribution is elliptic, while the uv range selection in $\\incode${CASA} is circular, our chosen thresholds are adjusted to make the final $\\Remark${CO21} synthesized beam similar to that of $\\Remark${CI10}.$\n",
       "$Note that in a later step we also convolved both image cubes to the exact same rounded beam (3.46\") before generating the moment maps.$\n",
       "$The \\textit{PHANGS-ALMA imaging \\& post-processing pipeline} \\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/akleroy/phangs_imaging_scripts}; version 2.0.} developed by \\citet{Leroy2021pipeline} is used for creating line cubes and moment maps. The code is suitable for general nearby galaxy strong line mapping interferometric and total power mosaic data. In brief, the visibility data are carefully transformed into the user-given channel width and frequency range corresponding to the line plus line-free channels, then continuum is subtracted by fitting an order of zero polynomial. Then, two stages of imaging (\"cleaning\") are performed: first a multi-scale cleaning down to \\sim4\\sigma, then a single-scale cleaning down to \\sim1\\sigma. At each stage, $\\incode${CASA}'s $\\incode${tclean} task is iteratively called so as to force many major cycles, which has proven to improve the accuracy of the deconvolution. Before and during the second stage cleaning, a clean mask is computed at each iteration according to the outcome of previous iteration by finding all >2\\sigma pixels associated with >4\\sigma peaks in a watershed algorithm (\\citealt{Rosolowsky2006,Rosolowsky2021}). In this way the cleaning can include as much signal as possible and ensure a signal-free residual.$\n",
       "$Then the image cubes are corrected for the primary beam attenuation, converted to Kelvin units, and convolved to a common beam, which is the coarser beam of $\\Remark${CO21} and $\\Remark${CI10}. Because of our uv range flagging before imaging, the directly $\\incode${tclean}-imaged beam sizes are already close. This convolution further precisely matches $\\Remark${CO21} and $\\Remark${CI10} image cube beams.$\n",
       "$Next, moment maps are generated with modules in the PHANGS-ALMA pipeline, consistently for CO and $\\CI$ . This process includes firstly constructing noise and mask cubes from the image cubes, then combining the masks (i.e., where science signal should present), then computing moment 0 -- line integrated intensity, moment 1 -- line peak velocity, and moment 2 -- line width. The mask cubes are the key in producing moment maps. Here two masks are built: a \"broad mask\" which contains as much plausible science signal as possible, and a \"strict mask\" which is optimized for high-confidence signal. The strict mask is made by finding peaks that have >4\\sigma over two consecutive channels then expanding down to 2\\sigma also with the watershed algorithm. Then the broad mask is obtained by aggregating strict masks made from image cubes convolved to coarser resolutions (\\sim30\" in this work as well as in \\citealt{Leroy2021pipeline}).$\n",
       "$To make consistent moment maps for CO and $\\CI$ , we aggregate their masks together as a joint mask, for broad and strict masks, respectively, then their final moment maps are computed within the joint mask.$\n",
       "$The resulting $\\Remark${CO21} and $\\Remark${CI10} line intensity maps are then used for our next line ratio analysis. The line velocity and line width maps are not further analyzed, but are consistent with the products from the PHANGS-ALMA survey's data release as well as in \\citet{Lang2020}. Given that the PHANGS-ALMA 12m+7m+tp $\\Remark${CO21} has the full spatial information and are deeper, their line velocity and line width maps are more useful for kinematic studies than ours produced from this work.$\n",

       "**Abstract:** Feedback and outflows in galaxies that are associated with a quasar phase are expected to be pivotal in quenching the most massive galaxies. However, observations targeting the molecular outflow phase, which dominates both the mass and momentum and removes the immediate fuel for star formation, are limited in high--z QSO hosts. Massive quiescent galaxies found at$z\\sim4$are predicted to have already quenched star formation by$z\\sim5$and undergone their most intense growth at$z>6$. Here, we present two ALMA detections of molecular outflows, traced by blue--shifted absorption of the OH 119\\mumdoublet, from a sample of three$z>6$infrared luminous QSO hosts: J2310+1855 and P183+05. OH 119\\mumis also detected in emission in P183+05, and tentatively in the third source: P036+03. Using similar assumptions as for high--z Dusty Star--Forming Galaxy outflows, we find that our QSOs drive molecular outflows with comparable mass outflow rates, and that are comparably energetic except for J2310+1855's significantly lower outflow energy flux. We do not find evidence, nor require additional input from the central AGN to drive the molecular outflow in J2310+1855 but can not rule out an AGN contribution in P183+05 if a significant AGN contribution to$\\rm L_{FIR}$is assumed and/or if the outflow covering fraction is high ($\\geq53\\%$), which evidence from the literature suggests is unlikely in these sources. Differences observed in the blue--shifted absorption spectral properties may instead be caused by the QSO hosts' more compact dust continuum, limiting observations to lower altitude and more central regions of the outflow.\n",

Hollow symbols indicate lower limits for J2310+1855 and P183+05, assuming a covering fraction equal to the fractional OH absorption depth (25\\% and 9.4\\%, respectively), and values derived assuming an average covering fraction of 0.3 \\citep{GonzalezAlfonso2017}, for the DSFG sample. The smaller faint orange symbols indicate ranges for J2310+1855 and P183+05 assuming a 50\\% AGN contribution to $\\rm L_{FIR}$(see text). We indicate regions in the top panel where the energy injected via star formation, assuming a maximum coupling fraction to the ISM of 40\\%\\citep{Sharma2014,Fielding2018}, is equal to the energy flux of the outflow (white), where an unusually high coupling fraction or AGN contribution is required (light grey), and where an AGN is definitely required (darker grey). We indicate regions in the bottom panel where SNe ejecta provide sufficient momentum (white) and where radiation pressure on dust grains in an optically thin (light grey) or thick (darker grey) outflow is needed. \\label{fig:FIRvsE} (*fig:FIRvsE*)\n",

We consider a clumpy outflow ejected from the center of the galaxy, travelling radially in five angles covering the left hand side of the disk, and vertically through a galactic fountain trajectory. On the right we show this trajectory as a solid black arrow. Orange circles indicate clumps that intervene the observer's line of site and the background continuum, and thus contribute to the absorption signature of the outflow. Grey circles indicate when clumps do not intervene and are invisible to the observer via absorption.  \\label{fig:cartoon} (*fig:cartoon*)\n",
