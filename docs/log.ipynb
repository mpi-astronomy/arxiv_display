The observed radio properties are in line with what is typically observed in high-$z$ radio quasars ($\\alpha_{\\rm r}=0.72\\pm 0.02$ and L$_{\\rm 1.4GHz}=5.8 \\pm 0.9 \\times 10^{26}$ W Hz$^{-1}$). Despite the relatively low X-ray flux observed $F_{\\rm 0.5-7.0 keV}=2.3\\pm0.5 \\times 10^{-14}$ erg sec$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, the intrinsic luminosity in the 2-10 keV rest frame is markedly high, $L_{\\rm 2-10 keV}=1.8^{+1.1}_{-0.7} \\times 10^{46}$ erg sec$^{-1}$, making RACS J032021.44$-$352104.1 one of the most luminous quasars currently known at $z>5.5$. The high X-ray luminosity is largely driven by an extrapolation to energies below the observable X-ray window with Chandra and the slope derived in the 0.5-7 keV band (or 3.5--50 keV in the rest-frame; $\\Gamma_{\\rm X}=3.3\\pm0.4$). By analysing the overall spectral energy distribution of the quasar we found that the remarkably soft X-ray emission: (1) cannot be produced by relativistic jets, even when relativistic boosting is considered; and (2) is consistent with expectations for a super-Eddington accreting SMBH. If such a high accretion rate was confirmed, this source would be a unique laboratory to study high accretion in the early Universe and could help resolve some challenges inherent in early black hole growth paradigms.         |"

       "|**Abstract**|            The 21 cm signal arising from fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen field, and its cross-correlation with other tracers of cosmic density, are promising probes of the high-redshift Universe. In this study, we assess the potential of the 21 cm power spectrum, along with its cross power spectrum with dark matter density and associated bias, to constrain both astrophysics during the reionization era and the underlying cosmology. Our methodology involves emulating these estimators using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), enabling efficient exploration of the parameter space. Utilizing a photon-conserving semi-numerical reionization model, we construct emulators at a fixed redshift ($z = 7.0$) for $k$-modes relevant to upcoming telescopes such as SKA-Low. We generate $\\sim7000$ training samples by varying both cosmological and astrophysical parameters along with initial conditions, achieving high accuracy when compared to true simulation outputs. While forecasting, the model involves five free parameters: three cosmological ($\\Omega_m$, $h$, $\\sigma_8$) and two astrophysical (ionizing efficiency, $\\zeta$, and minimum halo mass, $M_{\\mathrm{min}}$). Using a fiducial model at the mid-reionization stage, we create a mock dataset and perform forecasting with the trained emulators. Assuming a 5% observational uncertainty combined with emulator error, we find that the 21 cm and 21 cm-density cross power spectra can constrain the Hubble parameter ($h$) to better than 6% at a confidence interval of 95%, with tight constraints on the global neutral fraction ($Q_{\\mathrm{HI}}$). The inclusion of bias information further improves constraints on $\\sigma_8$ (< 10% at 95% confidence). Finally, robustness tests with two alternate ionization states and a variant with higher observational uncertainty show that the ionization fractions are still reliably recovered, even when cosmological constraints weaken.         |"

       "|**Abstract**|            The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is the nearest low-metallicity dwarf galaxy. Its proximity and low reddening has enabled us to detect its Wolf-Rayet (WR) star population with 12 known objects. Quantitative spectroscopy of the stars revealed half of these WR stars to be strong sources of He ii ionizing flux, but the average metallicity of the SMC is below where WR bumps are usually detected in integrated galaxy spectra showing nebular He ii emission. Utilizing the Local Volume Mapper (LVM), we investigate regions around the six SMC WN3h stars, whose winds are thin enough to avoid He recombination and allow photons with > 54 eV to escape. Focusing on He ii 4686 Å, we show that the broad stellar wind component, the strongest optical diagnostic of the WN3h stars, is diluted within 24 pc in the integrated light from LVM, making the WR stars hard to detect in low-metallicity integrated regions. In addition, we compare the He ii ionizing flux from LVM with the values inferred from the stellar atmosphere code PoWR and find that the nebular emission around them only in some cases reflects the high amounts emitted by the stars. We conclude that early-type WN stars with comparably weak winds are viable sources to produce the observed He ii ionizing flux in low-metallicity galaxies. The easy dilution of the stellar signatures can explain the rareness of WR bump detections at 12 + log O/H < 8.0, while at the same time providing major candidates for the observed excess of nebular He ii emission. This constitutes a challenge for population synthesis models across all redshifts as the evolutionary path towards this observed WR population at low metallicity remains enigmatic.         |\n",

       "|**Abstract**|            The origin of obscuration in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is still a matter of contention. It is unclear whether obscured AGN are primarily due to line-of-sight effects, a transitory, dust-enshrouded phase in galaxy evolution, or a combination of both. The role of an inner torus around the central SMBH also remains unclear in pure Evolution models. We use cosmological semi-analytic models and semi-empirical prescriptions to explore obscuration effects in AGN at 1<z<3. We consider a realistic object-by-object modelling of AGN evolution including different light curves (LCs) composed of phases of varying levels of obscuration, mimicking the possible clearing effects of strong AGN feedback. Evolution models characterized by AGN LCs with relatively short pre-peak obscured phases followed by more extended optical/UV visible post-peak phases, struggle to reproduce the high fraction of obscured AGN at z~2-3 inferred from X-ray surveys. Evolution models characterised by LCs with sharp post-peak declines or persistent or multiple obscuration phases are more successful, although they still face challenges in reproducing the steady drop in the fractions of obscured AGN with increasing luminosity measured by some groups. Invoking a fine-tuning in the input LCs, with more luminous AGN defined by longer optical/UV visible windows, can improve the match to the decreasing fractions of obscured AGN with luminosity. Alternatively, a long-lived central torus-like component, with thickness decreasing with increasing AGN power, naturally boosts the luminosity-dependent fractions of obscured AGN, suggesting that small-scale orientation effects may still represent a key component even in Evolution models. We also find that in our models major mergers and starbursts, when considered in isolation, fall short in accounting for the large fractions of highly obscured faint AGN detected at cosmic noon.         |\n",

       "|**Abstract**|            We report the discovery and characterization of a wide binary population in the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy Boötes I using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our sample consists of 52 candidate binaries with projected separations of 7,000 - 16,000 au and stellar masses from near the hydrogen-burning limit to the main-sequence turnoff ($\\sim0.1$ - $0.8~{\\rm M_\\odot}$). By forward-modeling selection biases and chance alignments, we find that $1.25\\pm0.25\\%$ of Boötes I stars are members of wide binaries with separations beyond 5,000 au. This fraction, along with the distributions of separations and mass ratios, matches that in the Solar neighborhood, suggesting that wide binary formation is largely insensitive to metallicity, even down to [Fe/H] $\\approx -2.5$. The observed truncation in the separation distribution near 16,000 au is well explained by stellar flyby disruptions. We also discuss how the binaries can be used to constrain the galaxy's dark matter properties. We show that our detection places new limits on primordial black hole dark matter, finding that compact objects with $M \\gtrsim 5~{\\rm M_\\odot}$ cannot constitute more than $\\sim1\\%$ of the dark matter content. In contrast to previous work, we find that wide binaries are unlikely to provide robust constraints on the dark matter profile of ultrafaint galaxies given the uncertainties in the initial binary population, flyby disruptions, and contamination from chance alignments. These findings represent the most robust detection of wide binaries in an external galaxy to date, opening a new avenue for studying binary star formation and survival in extreme environments.         |\n",

       "|**Abstract**|            A handful of enigmatic Jupiter-mass objects have been discovered orbiting pulsars. One such object, PSR J2322-2650b, uniquely resembles a hot Jupiter exoplanet due to its minimum density of 1.8 g/cm^3 and its ~1900 K equilibrium temperature. We use JWST to observe its emission spectrum across an entire orbit. In stark contrast to every known exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star, we find an atmosphere rich in molecular carbon (C3, C2) with strong westward winds. Our observations open up a new exoplanetary chemical regime (ultra-high C/O and C/N ratios of >100 and >10,000 respectively) and dynamical regime (ultra-fast rotation with external irradiation) to observational study. The extreme carbon enrichment poses a severe challenge to the current understanding of \"black widow\" companions, which were expected to consist of a wider range of elements due to their origins as stripped stellar cores.         |\n",

       "**Abstract:** We present radio and X-ray observations of the recently discovered $z=6.13$ radio-powerful quasar RACS J032021.44 $-$ 352104.1 using uGMRT, ATCA, LBA, and _Chandra_ .The observed radio properties are in line with what is typically observed in high- $z$ radio quasars ( $\\alpha_{\\rm r}=0.72\\pm 0.02$ and L $_{\\rm 1.4GHz}=5.8 \\pm 0.9 \\times 10^{26}$ W Hz $^{-1}$ ). Despite the relatively low X-ray flux observed $F_{\\rm 0.5-7.0 keV}=2.3\\pm0.5 \\times 10^{-14}$ erg sec $^{-1}$ cm $^{-2}$ , the intrinsic luminosity in the 2--10 keV rest frame is markedly high, $L_{\\rm 2-10 keV}=1.8^{+1.1}_{-0.7} \\times 10^{46}$ erg sec $^{-1}$ , making RACS J032021.44 $-$ 352104.1 one of the most luminous quasars currently known at $z>5.5$ . The high X-ray luminosity is largely driven by an extrapolation to energies below the observable X-ray window with $_ Chandra_$ and the slope derived in the 0.5-7 keV band (or 3.5--50 keV in the rest-frame; $\\Gamma_{\\rm X}=3.3\\pm0.4$ ).By analysing the overall spectral energy distribution of the quasar we found that the remarkably soft X-ray emission: (1) cannot be produced by relativistic jets, even when relativistic boosting is considered; and (2) is consistent with expectations for a super-Eddington accreting SMBH.If such a high accretion rate was confirmed, this source would be a unique laboratory to study high accretion in the early Universe and could help resolve some challenges inherent in early black hole growth paradigms.\n",

We highlight the following objects: $\\shortname$(red square; this work), HSC J092120.56+000722.9 (pink diamond;  ([Wolf, Nandra and Salvato 2023]()) ), CFHQS J142952+544717 (yellow triangles;  ([Migliori, Siemiginowska and Sobolewska 2023](), [Marcotulli, Connor and Bañados 2025]()) ) and PSO J030947+271757 (purple pentagon;  ([Moretti, Ghisellini and Caccianiga 2021]()) ). Since these last two sources present variable/flaring emission, we show two data-points representing the quiescent and the flaring state respectively. All the other quasars are reported with different colours based if they are also detected in the radio band (purple) or not (green). ** Right panel:** Rest-frame, multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution of $\\shortname$. The X-ray weak super-Eddington SED from [Pacucci and Narayan (2024)]() is shown in magenta. The solid black line is a quasar template  ([Polletta, Tajer and Maraschi 2007]())  matched to the optical-UV data-points. The dashed black line is the X-ray emission expected from the UV-X-ray relation derived by [Lusso and Risaliti (2016)]() and assuming $\\Gamma_{\\rm X}=2.0$. The gray regions show the 1,2$\\sigma$ dispersion of the relation. The vertical yellow region indicates frequencies heavily affected by the absorption of the intergalactic medium.

In this study, we assess the potential of the 21 cm power spectrum, along with its cross power spectrum with dark matter density and associated bias, to constrain both astrophysics during the reionization era and the underlying cosmology. Our methodology involves emulating these estimators using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), enabling efficient exploration of the parameter space. Utilizing a photon-conserving semi-numerical reionization model, we construct emulators at a fixed redshift (z = 7.0) for k-modes relevant to upcoming telescopes such as SKA-Low. We generate \\sim7000 training samples by varying both cosmological and astrophysical parameters along with initial conditions, achieving high accuracy when compared to true simulation outputs. While forecasting, the model involves five free parameters: three cosmological (\\Omega_m, h, \\sigma_8) and two astrophysical (ionizing efficiency, \\zeta, and minimum halo mass, M_{\\mathrm{min}}). Using a fiducial model at the mid-reionization stage, we create a mock dataset and perform forecasting with the trained emulators. Assuming a 5\\% observational uncertainty combined with emulator error, we find that the 21 cm and 21 cm-density cross power spectra can constrain the Hubble parameter (h) to better than 6\\% at a confidence interval of 95\\%, with tight constraints on the global neutral fraction (Q_{\\mathrm{HI}}). The inclusion of bias information further improves constraints on \\sigma_8 (< 10\\% at 95\\% confidence). Finally, robustness tests with two alternate ionization states and a variant with higher observational uncertainty show that the ionization fractions are still reliably recovered, even when cosmological constraints weaken.}$\n",

       "$The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) signifies the last major phase transition in the cosmic history of our Universe, when it evolves from a mostly neutral to a mostly ionized state \\citep[for reviews, see][]{2001PhR...349..125B,2009CSci...97..841C,2018PhR...780....1D,2022arXiv220802260G,2022GReGr..54..102C}. The fluctuation in the neutral hydrogen field during EoR can be potentially traced by the redshifted 21 cm signal, which arises due to the spin flip transition of the neutral hydrogen atoms at the ground state. The signal carries useful information on cosmological and astrophysical properties of this high redshift epoch. This can new comprehensive answers to the questions about the ionization and thermal state of the high redshift intergalactic medium (IGM), nature of the first ionizing sources, and the timeline of reionization epoch. It can also inform us about cosmic expansion and structure evolution  ([ and Pritchard 2012]()) .$\n",
       "$While the radio interferometers are gradually improving their sensitivity to detect the 21 cm signal, these still face significant challenges in terms of foreground contamination and instrument characterization, allowing only upper limits on the detection. These efforts include independent groups focussing on different telescopes such as the Low Frequency Array \\citep[LOFAR;][]{2019MNRAS.488.4271G,2020MNRAS.493.1662M,2025arXiv250305576M}, the Murchison Winewcommandield Array \\citep[MWA;][]{2019ApJ...884....1B,2020MNRAS.493.4711T,2025arXiv250509097N}, the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope \\citep[GMRT;][]{2013MNRAS.433..639P}, and the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array \\citep[HERA phase I;][]{hera2023} at redshift range z\\sim6-10. A few projects, such as Owens Valley Long Wavelength Array \\citep[OVRO-LWA][]{2019AJ....158...84E}  and New Extension in Nançay Upgrading LOFAR \\citep[NenuFAR][]{2021sf2a.conf..211M,2024A&A...681A..62M}, also aim for higher redshifts covering cosmic dawn. The limits have already been exploited to constrain some of the extreme reionization models  (ghara2025) . However, with upcoming facilities like SKA-Low (AA* and AA4 configuration), we expect to detect the signal with percentage-level uncertainties.$\n",
       "$As 21 cm signal is supposed to be mainly driven by astrophysical processes, most of the EoR studies with 21 cm signal as a probe mainly focus on constraining uncertain astrophysical parameters, keeping the underlying cosmology fixed. Nonetheless, 21 cm signal can also play a crucial role in probing cosmology in combination with other probes like CMB  ([McQuinn, et. al 2006](), [ and Liu 2016]()) . However, the studies aiming for cosmological forecasts with 21 cm signal require efficient models to explore astrophysics and cosmology simultaneously. To this end, analytical halo model of reionization  ([Schneider, Schaeffer and Giri 2023]())  and machine learning based techniques  ([Kern, et. al 2017](), [Hassan, Andrianomena and Doughty 2020]())  have recently been exploited, highlighting the prospects of constraining cosmology and astrophysics with 21 cm. Specifically, the approach of creating emulators of observables or likelihoods has been reasonably successful in inferring astrophysical parameters from 21 cm power spectra and EoR observables  ([ and Shimabukuro 2017](), [ and Schmit 2018](), [Breitman, Mesinger and Murray 2024](), [Sikder, et. al 2024](), [Maity, Paranjape and Choudhury 2023](), [Choudhury, Ghara and Zaroubi 2024](), [Choudhury, Paranjape and Maity 2024]()) .$\n",
       "$Parallelly, the windows are now getting open for synergetic studies with 21 cm and other high redshift probes. For example, the distribution of Ly-\\alpha emitting high redshift galaxies can be used as a biased tracer of large scale density structure of the universe and is useful for cross-correlation with 21 cm  ([Vrbanec and Ciardi 2016](), [Mirocha, et. al 2023](), [Moriwaki, Beane and Lidz 2024]()) . There exist other tracers of density, such as intensity maps \\citep[as a review, see, ][]{2017arXiv170909066K} of CO  ([Lidz, Furlanetto and Oh 2011]()) , CII  ([Gong, Cooray and Silva 2012]()) , H\\alpha  ([ and Heneka 2021]()) , OIII  ([Moriwaki, Yoshida and Shimizu 2018]()) ;  which can also be utilized for cross-correlation studies. Hence, the cross-correlation between 21 cm and cosmic matter density, an estimator independent of any specific tracers, can new us with a potential probe of the high redshift universe  ([Xu, Xu and Yue 2019]()) . Furthermore, the cross power spectra is a superior probe in terms of signal-to-noise ratio due to uncorrelated systematics and can complement the pure 21 cm auto power spectra signal. With the availability of current and upcoming telescopes like James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (NGRST), Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) etc, the cross-correlation prospects have been shown to be promising in gleaning astrophysical signal during EoR  ([Gagnon-Hartman, Davies and Mesinger 2025]()) . In principle, the cross-correlation information can also be utilized to infer cosmology, which has already been explored in low redshift studies  ([Berti, Spinelli and Viel 2024](), [Autieri, et. al 2025]()) .$\n",
       "$In this study, we aim to check the prospects of 21 cm and its cross-correlation information with matter density in constraining both astrophysics and cosmology during reionization epoch.  Unlike other semi-numerical approach based on the excursion set algorithm, we utilize a more realistic prescription newd by \\textbf{S}emi Numerical \\textbf{C}ode for \\textbf{R}e\\textbf{I}onization with \\textbf{P}ho\\textbf{T}on Conservation (\\texttt{SCRIPT}) to generate the neutral hydrogen fluctuation field. We consider only a single redshift (z=7.0) for creating the emulators and pursuing parameter exploration, which gives us a starting point as a proof of concept.  However, this can be extended to multiple redshifts, exploring the full power of 21 cm observables in future studies.$\n",

Next, we discuss building the emulators of those observables, highlighting the performance of our emulators against the true values in section \\ref{sec:emulator}. Once the emulator is trained, we describe the mock generation procedure in section \\ref{sec:gen_mock} and parameter exploration in section \\ref{sec:param_exp}.

In this work, we adopt the simplest version of this framework—a two-parameter reionization model previously used for 21 cm forecasting  ([ and Maity 2023]()) . For completeness, we briefly summarize the methodology here.$\n",
       "$\\texttt{SCRIPT} simulates the ionization state of the Universe within a cosmologically representative volume, enabling the computation of large-scale ionization fluctuation power spectra that are converged with respect to the resolution of the simulation box  ([ and Choudhury 2018]()) . To initialize the model, we new the density field and the spatial distribution of collapsed halos capable of emitting ionizing radiation. Focusing on large-scale IGM features, we use the second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT) to generate the density field, rather than relying on computationally expensive full N-body simulations. Specifically, we used the implementation by [ and Hahn (2011)]()\\footnote{\\url{https://www-n.oca.eu/ohahn/MUSIC/}}. This model also allows us to vary different cosmological parameters (\\Omega_m, h, \\sigma_8, n_s, w_0 in this case) as well as the initial seed for generating the fluctuating fields. The parameters have the standard meanings i.e., \\Omega_m: dark matter density, h: bubble parameter, \\sigma_8: quantifies the amplitude of primordial matter fluctuations, n_s: tilt of the primordial power spectra, and w_0: dark energy equation of state. We fix the baryonic density parameter (\\Omega_b=0.0482) throughout the study. The distribution of halos is computed using a subgrid approach based on the conditional ellipsoidal collapse mass function  ([ and Sheth 2002]()) . Although this approach has been proven to be extremely successful for standard \\LambdaCDM models, one essential assumption for our study is that the prescription remains the same for the range of cosmology models considered here.  Simulations are conducted within a comoving box of size 256~h^{-1}\\mathrm{cMpc}, which has been shown to be sufficient for the observables considered here, as demonstrated in recent literature  ([Iliev, Mellema and Ahn 2014](), [Kaur, Gillet and Mesinger 2020]()) .$\n",

       "$As mentioned earlier, we use a basic reionization model containing two free parameters, which are needed to get the ionization topology. The model adopts the photon-conserving algorithm to construct the reionization topology within the simulation box. Specifically, the ionization field relies on the ionization efficiency parameter (\\zeta), which estimates the available ionizing photons per hydrogen atom and minimum threshold halo mass (M_{\\mathrm{min}}) required to get the fraction of mass collapsed inside a halo. We restrict ourselves to this simple two-parameter setup as we aim to pursue a prospective forecasting study with 21 cm and its cross-correlations with matter density, while simultaneously varying astrophysical and cosmological parameters. This basic setup helps us to gain the required efficiency by minimizing the parameter space. However, the study can be expanded with more physical models of reionization, including recombination and radiative feedback effects  ([ and Maity 2022]())  in a future project.$\n",

The linear bias is expected to be a reasonable approximation for the large-scale modes, which are of interest in this study.

The input layer receives raw data, while the hidden layers perform complex computations to extract meaningful features. The output layer then news the final prediction. Each connection between neurons has an associated weight and bias, which are adjusted during the training to minimize errors. Further, in order to allow the network to learn complex patterns, non-linearities are introduced by activation functions, such as ReLU and Sigmoid. The learning process is guided by a loss function, which measures the error, and an optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent or Adam, which updates the weights through backpropagation \\citep[for details, see][]{2007JEI....16d9901B,2020MNRAS.491.4031C}. A portion of the training datasets is used for validation purposes during the development of the emulator, and this process progresses in an iterative manner. Once the network is fully trained, it is tested on a different set of data, providing a robustness check on the predictions. In general, ANNs can face two key challenges during training, i.e., underfitting and overfitting. Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple to capture the patterns in the data, leading to poor performance on both the training and validation sets. This often happens when the network has too few layers or neurons, or when the training time is insufficient. On the other side, overfitting happens when the model learns the noise and specific details of the training data instead of generalizing to new data. This results in excellent performance on the training set but poor accuracy on unseen validation or test data. Overfitting is common when the network is too complex or trained for too many epochs without proper regularization. To check the performance of the network, we use R^2 metric score, which is newcommandined as$\n",
       "$\\be$\n",
       "$R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum (y_{\\mathrm{true}}-y_{\\mathrm{predict}})^2}{\\sum (y_{\\mathrm{true}}-\\langle y_{\\mathrm{true}}\\rangle)^2}$\n",
       "$\\ee$\n",
       "$where y_{\\mathrm{true}} is the true value of the observables from simulation, \\langle y_{\\mathrm{true}}\\rangle is the average from the test set and y_{\\mathrm{predict}} is the corresponding prediction from the network. This essentially news an assessment for goodness of fit, where metric value can vary from 0 to 1.  As the R^2 value gets closer to 1, the prediction capability of the emulator gets better.$\n",
       "$\\subsection{Training Procedure}$\n",
       "$To generate the training dataset, we vary the different parameters within a reasonable prior ranges i.e. \\Omega_m:[0.2,0.4], h:[0.6,0.8], \\sigma_8:[0.7,0.9], n_s:[0.9,1.0], w_0:[-2,0], \\zeta:[1,40] and \\log M_{\\min}:[7,12]. The baryonic density parameter, \\Omega_b is fixed at 0.0482, obeying the findings from CMB spectra  ([Aghanim and Akrami 2020]()) . We store the power spectra in 10 different bins between k\\simeq0.05 ~\\mathrm{h/cMpc} to 1.084~\\mathrm{h/cMpc}. However, we take only 6 bins in the range k\\simeq0.11 ~\\mathrm{h/cMpc} to 0.84~\\mathrm{h/cMpc} for further analysis, which are expected to be probed by upcoming instruments like SKA-Low. The goal here is to predict the corresponding amplitude in those bins given a set of parameter values. Given that motivation, we generate a total of 6750 samples for each type of observables (21 cm power spectra, 21cm-density cross power spectra amplitude and cross bias) by randomly varying these parameters. Among these samples, 500 correspond to different realizations of the initial seed. This further takes into account the cosmic variance uncertainties during the training. We utilize publicly available Scikit-learn and TensorFlow packages in Python to implement the network.  We split the sample in training and testing sets with a ratio of 80 to 20. Our assumed network architecture is summarized in Table \\ref{tab:arch}.  We use ReLU activation between the layers and Adam optimizer in this setup. An architecture with 10 hidden layers along with one input and one output layer, performs well to serve the purpose of the study.$\n",

Each panel shows the six different bins considered in this study. It is visually clear that the true and predicted values are well correlated with each other, signifying a good accuracy of the prediction. The overall R^2 metric score for the test set is 0.98, which also quantifies a well trained model with high predictive power. Similarly, we show the true vs prediction plot for 21 cm-density cross power spectrum in Figure \\ref{fig:comp_21_mat_cross} and for cross bias in Figure \\ref{fig:comp_21_bias}. The corresponding R^2 metric values are 0.99 and 0.92, respectively, which again news a significantly accurate prediction. For cross power spectra, we emulate the quantity Q_{\\mathrm{HI}}\\vert \\Delta_{21\\times\\delta}^2\\vert at first and then divide by Q_{\\mathrm{HI}}, where the IGM is not fully ionized. This helps us to avoid any possible divergence due to fully ionized IGM in the training set.

       "$In Figure \\ref{fig:comp_posterior_fiducial}, we show the posterior recoveries of the free parameters from the fiducial mock dataset. The free parameters include both cosmological (\\Omega_m, h, \\sigma_8) as well as astrophysical ones (\\zeta, \\log M_{\\mathrm{min}}). We also show the posterior of the globally averaged neutral fraction (Q_{\\mathrm{HI}}) as a derived parameter. We find that the parameters are not well constrained for the case where we utilize only 21 cm power spectra (shown in red), although it can correctly recover the global neutral fraction with wide uncertainties. The constraints are improved significantly when we include 21cm-density cross power spectra as observables along with 21 cm power spectra (shown in lime green). Specifically, the Hubble parameter (h) is constrained within an uncertainty of <6\\% at a confidence interval of 95\\%. This signifies the potential of 21 cm and synergies with galaxy observables as an independent probe to constrain the expansion rate of the universe, which can further shed light onto the well known Hubble tension  ([Riess, et. al 2019](), [Verde, Treu and Riess 2019]()) . Furthermore, the global neutral fraction is now stringently constrained, discarding a significant portion of astrophysical parameter spaces. On top of that, if we include the bias of cross spectra, it further constrains \\sigma_8 parameter (providing <10\\% uncertainty at 95\\% confidence). This happens as the combination now has the information on the amplitude of the underlying matter power spectra (see equation \\ref{eq:bias}), which is controlled by \\sigma_8. We also note that the reionization source parameters are also well recovered, and the uncertainties subsequently improve as we include more observables. However, \\Omega_m is bounded by only one side due to strong degeneracy with astrophysical parameters.$\n",

We tune the ionizing efficiency parameter to generate the mocks with a higher (Q_{\\mathrm{HI}}=0.65) and a lower (Q_{\\mathrm{HI}}=0.29) neutral fraction than the fiducial one (Q_{\\mathrm{HI}}=0.47), while all the other input parameters are kept the same as before. In Figure \\ref{fig:comp_posterior_QHI}, we show the recovered posteriors of these cases along with the fiducial one. We find that the h and \\sigma_8 parameters are well constrained even for the higher neutral fraction, recovering the underlying true values within 95\\% uncertainties as before. The astrophysical parameters are also consistent with the input values. On the other hand, the constraints on the parameters for lower neutral fraction are not significantly strong, barely constraining h and providing one sided bound on \\sigma_8 at 95\\% uncertainty level. This is not very surprising as the ionized bubbles start to overlap when the universe is highly ionized (lower neutral fraction) which can wipe out the correlation information, resulting in a loss of constraining power.  However, the neutral fraction has still been recovered with significant precision without any strong bias. This also confirms the fact that the 21 cm observables are more sensitive to the ionization state of the universe rather than the underlying cosmological information.$\n",
       "$Lastly, we check the effects of observational uncertainties on the posterior distribution in Figure \\ref{fig:comp_posterior_uncertain}. The green contours show the case where we assume the uncertainties to be 10\\% of the observable amplitudes, while the other one is same as the fiducial case with 5\\% uncertainties.

       "$The astrophysics during the Epoch of Reionization is gradually getting explored with the help of multi-wavelength observables. The 21 cm signal is one of the crucial probes which has the potential to detect neutral hydrogen fluctuations at EoR directly. This further contains useful information about the cosmological parameters, although it is hard to infer cosmology from this weak signal, affected by foreground contamination and poorly understood high redshift astrophysical phenomena. To this end, the cross-correlation of 21 cm signal with other tracers of cosmological density can be a complementary probe of astrophysics and cosmology. This is useful to avoid any systematics arising due to spurious correlation and, hence, enhance the signal to noise ratio of detection. In this study, we check the prospects of 21 cm-density cross power and its bias along with 21 cm power spectra in order to probe the astrophysics and cosmology from the EoR. Our approach relies on creating an efficient emulator of the observables and utilizing the emulator for further parameter space exploration. Below, we summarize this work, highlighting the main findings.$\n",
       "$\\begin{itemize}$\n",
       "$    \\item We used a realistic semi-numerical reionization model based on a photon-conserving algorithm to study the prospects of 21 cm and related observables to infer cosmology and astrophysics during the EoR. Specifically, we used 21 cm auto power spectra, magnitude of cross power between  21 cm fluctuations and matter density, and the corresponding bias magnitude. As a prospective study, we focused only at a single redshift i.e. z=7.0 in this work. While 21 cm auto power spectra can be observed directly by the radio interferometers,  21cm-density cross power spectra and the bias can not be measured directly.$\n",
       "$    However, the cross power and its bias can be in principle be estimated by different tracers, especially via galaxy-21cm cross-correlation.$\n",
       "$    We created a total of  \\sim7000 samples by varying different astrophysical and cosmological parameters to build the emulator for these observables/estimators. The samples were generated with different initial random seeds, which further takes into account for the cosmic variance uncertainties. The emulators were trained to predict the observables at 6 different k bins, given a set of input free parameters (including astrophysical and cosmological ones). The bins were chosen in the range where we can expect the detection of 21 cm signal from the upcoming telescopes like SKA-Low. We compared the emulators against true values and found that the predictions are sufficiently accurate, providing R^2 values >0.9 for all the cases (0.98 for 21 cm auto power spectra, 0.99 for cross power spectra, 0.92 for bias amplitude). This newd us with the confidence to do efficient parameter space exploration utilizing the emulators.$\n",
       "$    \\item Next, we generated the mock observables with a fiducial set of parameter values, consistent with [Aghanim and Akrami (2020)]() and providing an ionization state close to the middle of reionization process. We found that 21 cm power spectra alone can not constrain the cosmological parameters, while they can recover the correct ionization state. When we included cross power spectra as another observable, Hubble parameter was constrained and adding bias magnitude on top of it further constrained the amplitude of primordial matter fluctuations (\\sigma_8). Similarly, the constraints on the ionization state were also improved significantly. We further pursued a similar analysis with two more mock datasets corresponding to a higher and lower neutral fraction. The recoveries were degraded for lower neutral fraction due to a possible lack of correlation information. However, the ionization states were still precisely recovered for all the cases.$\n",

       "$We would like to caution that the exact quantification of constraints is dependent on the emulator uncertainties, which can be improved with larger datasets spanning wider parameter spaces and with more sophisticated training techniques. We also neglect any covariance between the Fourier modes as well as between observables while computing the likelihood. While the mutual covariances would be ideal to include and may probably degrade the uncertainties, the estimates of 21 cm observables are generally newd without the covariances information in the literature  (ghara2025) . Similarly, multi-observable inference studies usually neglect covariance information between the observables  ([ and Maity 2022](), [Qin and Mesinger 2025]()) . Hence, we proceed with the diagonal terms, assuming relatively conservative uncertainties and mutually independent observables. Further, one needs to be cautious while interpreting cosmology with real observational data, as the observational estimates (limits till now) are often derived assuming an underlying cosmology, which should be properly quantified and corrected before inference. All these aspects may be important and will be useful to check with a separate study in the future. To this end, the main conclusions of this study utilizing mocks are unlikely to be changed much, providing an insight into the applicability of 21 cm and corresponding synergies as EoR/cosmology probe.$\n",
       "$The detection prospect of cross power spectrum signal between 21 cm and galaxies are very bright, given the ongoing and upcoming major observational facilities like HERA, SKA, ELT, NGRST etc. For example, HERA-NGRST cross-correlation can new a 14\\sigma detection with an assumption 500 square-deg common survey area  ([Mirocha, et. al 2023]()) , while the detection can be improved to 55\\sigma with SKA-Low AA*  ([Gagnon-Hartman, Davies and Mesinger 2025]()) . There also exists exciting potential for cross-correlation between intensity maps of metals like CII, CO and 21 cm, where a \\sim7\\sigma detection is possible with available instruments  ([ and Fronenberg 2024]()) .  To this end, our study news an expectation on astrophysical as well as cosmological inference during reionization from 21 cm, its cross-correlation with dark matter density and corresponding bias. We chose the direct cross-correlation between 21 cm and density to avoid any further astrophysical uncertainties associated with any specific tracers which also helps to build up efficient emulators.  Although the cross-correlation between 21 cm and dark matter density can not be measured directly, its bias can be derived and these can be useful indirect estimators utilizing the future observations.$\n",
       "$ Currently, we use a simplistic two parameter reionization model in this study while the realistic universe is expected to be much complex. For example, in a more realistic model, one needs additional parameters such as the IGM clumping factor and temperature increment for photoionization heating, to quantify the effect of the inhomogeneous recombination and radiative feedback processes  ([ and Maity 2022]()) .  As a natural consequence of a more complex model, the number of training samples is expected to be larger to capture the whole parameter space, along with additional degeneracies between the parameters.  Some of the degeneracies can be alleviated by utilizing complementary reionization probes such as UV luminosity function (UVLFs), Ly-\\alpha forest fluctuations,  CMB scattering optical depth etc  ([Qin, et. al 2021](), [ and Maity 2022](), [Qin and Mesinger 2025]()) .  However, a two parameter vanilla model is often sufficient to new the typical nature and amplitude of the fluctuations in the 21 cm field and the state of the IGM  ([ and Maity 2023]()) , which serves the purpose of this proof of concept study. In the future, we would like to explore with a more realistic reionization model, including above mentioned effects if those affect the cosmological inference. Similarly, the prospects for more direct tracers such as cross correlation between 21 cm and Ly-\\alpha emitters density (instead of dark matter density), can be explored, avoiding any assumption of linear scale independent galaxy bias. Parallelly, we would like to extend the study with more redshifts, incorporating full information of high redshift 21 cm observations. Eventually, these can be jointly explored with other EoR and cosmic dawn probes to simultaneously constrain astrophysics and cosmology.$\n",

       "**Abstract:** The 21 cm signal arising from fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen field, and its cross-correlation with other tracers of cosmic density, are promising probes of the high-redshift Universe. In this study, we assess the potential of the 21 cm power spectrum, along with its cross power spectrum with dark matter density and associated bias, to constrain both astrophysics during the reionization era and the underlying cosmology. Our methodology involves emulating these estimators using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), enabling efficient exploration of the parameter space. Utilizing a photon-conserving semi-numerical reionization model, we construct emulators at a fixed redshift ( $z = 7.0$ ) for $k$ -modes relevant to upcoming telescopes such as SKA-Low. We generate $\\sim7000$ training samples by varying both cosmological and astrophysical parameters along with initial conditions, achieving high accuracy when compared to true simulation outputs. While forecasting, the model involves five free parameters: three cosmological ( $\\Omega_m$ , $h$ , $\\sigma_8$ ) and two astrophysical (ionizing efficiency, $\\zeta$ , and minimum halo mass, $M_{\\mathrm{min}}$ ). Using a fiducial model at the mid-reionization stage, we create a mock dataset and perform forecasting with the trained emulators. Assuming a 5 \\% observational uncertainty combined with emulator error, we find that the 21 cm and 21 cm-density cross power spectra can constrain the Hubble parameter ( $h$ ) to better than 6 \\% at a confidence interval of 95 \\% , with tight constraints on the global neutral fraction ( $Q_{\\mathrm{HI}}$ ). The inclusion of bias information further improves constraints on $\\sigma_8$ (< 10 \\% at 95 \\% confidence). Finally, robustness tests with two alternate ionization states and a variant with higher observational uncertainty show that the ionization fractions are still reliably recovered, even when cosmological constraints weaken.\n",
