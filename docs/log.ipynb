       "|**Abstract**|            We report the spectroscopic confirmation of a merging pair of massive quiescent galaxies at $z=3.44$. Using JWST observations, we confirm that the two galaxies lie at a projected separation of 4.5 kpc with a velocity offset of $\\sim 680\\, {\\rm km\\, s^{-1}}\\ (\\delta_z \\sim 0.01)$. The pair resides in the core of a known rich overdensity of galaxies, dubbed the \"Cosmic Vine\". For both pair members, modeling of the Spectral Energy Distributions and faint rest-frame optical emission lines indicate high stellar masses ($\\log{(M_\\star/M_\\odot)}\\sim10.9$) and suppressed star formation ($\\log{\\rm (sSFR/yr^{-1})}<-10$), more than an order of magnitude below the level of the star formation main sequence at this redshift. We then explore the Illustris-TNG simulation and the GAEA and SHARK semi-analytical models to examine whether they produce a pair of massive quiescent galaxies akin to that of the Cosmic Vine. While all models produce close pairs of massive quiescent galaxies at $2<z<4$ with comparable separations and velocity offsets, their predicted number densities are $10-80$ times lower than our observational constraint. This discrepancy cannot be fully explained by coarse time sampling in these models or the general challenge of forming early massive quiescent galaxies in simulations. Given that $>90\\%$ of simulated pairs in the models that we analyzed merge by $z=0$, our findings suggest that our observed pair will likely coalesce into a single massive galaxy. The merger, occurring in the dense core of a large-scale structure, might represent a critical event in the formation of a brightest cluster galaxy and the morphological transformation of high-redshift disky quiescent galaxies into early-type ellipticals.         |"

       "|**Abstract**|            In addition to the hot intracluster medium, massive galaxy clusters host complex, multi-phase gaseous halos. In this work, we quantify the abundance, spatial distribution, and origin of the cool T < 10^4.5 K gas within clusters. To do so, we combine the TNG-Cluster and TNG300 cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations, yielding a sample of 632 simulated galaxy clusters at z=0 with masses M_200c ~ 10^14-15.4 solar masses. We find that cool gas is present in every cluster at z=0, although it constitutes only a small fraction of the total gas mass within twice the virial radius, ranging from ~10^-4 to a few per cent. The majority of cool gas resides in the cluster outskirts in infalling satellites and other halos. More rarely, cool gas can also be present in the central regions of clusters. More massive halos contain larger amounts (but not fractions) of cool gas ~10^10-12 solar masses, and we identify correlations between cluster cool gas fraction and several global halo and galaxy properties at fixed halo mass. Using Monte-Carlo Lagrangian tracer particles, we then track the origin of cool gas in present-day clusters. We find that the primary source is recent accretion at z < 0.1, predominantly in the form of pre-cooled gas carried by infalling satellite galaxies and other halos. However, in-situ cooling of the hot intracluster medium gas accreted at earlier epochs also contributes, especially in present-day cool-core clusters.         |"

       "|**Abstract**|            The TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations, produce a diverse population of X-ray cavities in the intracluster medium (ICM) of simulated galaxy clusters. These arise from episodic, high velocity, kinetic energy injections from the central active supermassive black hole (AGN, SMBH). Here, we present the first comprehensive comparative analysis of X-ray cavities in TNG-Cluster with observational data. First, we select a volume-limited sample of 35 real clusters ($z \\leq 0.071$, M$_\\text{500c}$ = 10$^{14-14.8}$ M$_\\odot$) observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, identify 3 analogs for each in TNG-Cluster (total of 105) and generate mock Chandra images using same exposure times as their observed counterparts. We identify X-ray cavities and measure their properties in both datasets using identical techniques, ensuring a direct, apples-to-apples comparison. Our analysis reveals that both samples have a similar fraction of X-ray cavities (35-43 per cent). They exhibit comparable sizes and morphologies, although the sizes of simulated X-ray cavities still attached to the SMBH are somewhat larger in TNG-Cluster -- a scarcity at $< 10$ kpc. The area of TNG X-ray cavities increases as they rise in the ICM, consistent with the trend seen in the observational sample. The cavity powers, estimated using observational techniques, show good agreement between the two samples (10$^{42-45}$ erg.s$^{-1}$), suggesting that X-ray cavities in the simulation are an important heating mechanism in cluster cores. Overall, the rather simple AGN feedback model of TNG, with no model choices made to reproduce X-ray morphological features, and without cosmic rays, creates a quantitatively realistic population of X-ray cavities at cluster scales.         |"

       "|**Abstract**|            In this study, we examine the frequency and physical drivers of transformations from cool-core (CC) to non-cool-core (NCC) clusters, and vice versa, in a sample of 352 massive galaxy clusters (M_vir = 10^14-15.3 M_sun) from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation of galaxies. By identifying transformations based on the evolution of central entropy and focusing on z<2.5, we find that clusters frequently undergo such events, depending on their assembly and supermassive black hole histories. On average, clusters experience 2 to 3 transformations. Transformations can occur in both directions and can be temporary, but those to higher entropy cores, i.e. in the direction from CC to NCC states, are the vast majority. CC phases are shorter than NCC phases, and thus overall the TNG-Cluster population forms with low-entropy cores and moves towards NCC states with time. We study the role that mergers play in driving transformations, and find that mergers within ~1Gyr prior to a transformation toward higher (but not lower) entropy cores occur statistically more often than in a random control sample. Most importantly, we find examples of mergers associated with CC disruption regardless of their mass ratio or angular momentum. However, past merger activity is not a good predictor for z=0 CC status, at least based on core entropy, even though clusters undergoing more mergers eventually have the highest core entropy values at z=0. We consider the interplay between AGN feedback and evolving cluster core thermodynamics. We find that core transformations are accompanied by an increase in AGN activity, whereby frequent and repeated (kinetic) energy injections from the central SMBHs can produce a collective, long-term impact on central entropy, ultimately heating cluster cores. Whether such fast-paced periods of AGN activity are triggered by mergers is plausible, but not necessary.         |"

       "|**Abstract**|            Outflows are a key element in the baryon cycle of galaxies, and their properties provide a fundamental test for our models of how star formation quenches in galaxies. Here we report the detection of outflowing gas in two recently quenched, massive ($M_\\star\\sim10^{10.2}M_\\odot$) galaxies at z=4.106 (NS_274) and z=7.276 (RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7) observed with JWST/NIRSpec. The outflows are traced by blue-shifted MgII absorption lines, and in the case of the z=4.1 system, also by FeII and NaI features. The spectra of the two sources are similar to those of local post-starburst galaxies, showing deep Balmer features and minimal star formation on 10 Myr timescales as traced by the lack of bright emission lines, also suggesting the absence of a strong and radiatively efficient AGN. The galaxies' SFHs are consistent with an abrupt quenching of star formation, which continued at rates of $\\sim15\\,M_\\odot$/yr averaged over 100 Myr timescales. Dedicated millimeter observations of NS_274 constrain its dust obscured SFR to $<12\\,M_\\odot$/yr. Under simple geometrical assumptions, we derive mass loading factors $\\lesssim1$ and $\\sim50$ for the z=4.1 and z=7.3 systems, respectively, and similarly different energies carried by the outflows. Supernovae feedback can account for the mass and energy of the outflow in NS_274. However, the low mass loading factor and average gas velocity suggest that the observed outflow is unlikely to be the reason behind its quenching. SF-related processes seem to be insufficient to explain the extreme mass outflow rate of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7, which would require an additional ejective mechanism such as an undetected AGN. Finally, the average outflow velocities per unit $M_\\star$, SFR, or its surface area are consistent with those of lower-redshift post-starburst galaxies, suggesting that outflows in rapidly quenched galaxies might occur similarly across cosmic time.

       "|**Abstract**|            The abundance ratio of $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N is, in principle, a powerful tool for tracing stellar nucleosynthesis. This work aims to measure and analyze ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N)$\\times$($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C) and $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N abundance ratios in massive star-forming regions across a range of galactocentric distances to provide constraints on galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models. We present H$^{13}$CN and HC$^{15}$N J=2-1 results toward 51massive star-forming regions obtained with the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimétrique (IRAM) 30 meter telescope.\\ We used these results to derive ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N)$\\times$($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C) abundance ratios as well as $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N ratios using the double isotope method. We find an overall decreasing trend in the ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N)$\\times$($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C) abundance ratio and an increasing trend in the $^{14}$N$/^{15}$N ratio with increasing galactocentric distance ($D_{\\rm GC}$), which provides a good constraint for the GCE model based on high signal to noise ratio measurements. While the predicted ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N)$\\times$($^{13}$C/$^{12}$C) ratios between 6 and 12 kpc determined using current GCE models are consistent with our observational results, the ratios from models for $D_{\\rm GC}$ less than 6 kpc are significantly higher than the observational results, which indicates GCE models for $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N and/or $^{13}$C/$^{12}$C ratios need to be updated for at least this range.         |\n",

       "|**Abstract**|            The Fornax cluster is one of the most nearby X-ray bright galaxy clusters. Previous observations of the intracluster medium were limited to less than R500. We aim to significantly extend the X-ray coverage. We use data from five SRG/eROSITA all-sky surveys and perform a detailed one- and two-dimensional X-ray surface brightness analysis, allowing us to trace hot gas emission from kpc to Mpc scales with a single instrument. We compare the results to those from a recent numerical simulation of the local Universe (SLOW) and correlate the X-ray emission distribution with that of other tracers, including cluster member galaxies, ultra compact dwarf galaxies, intracluster globular clusters, and HI-tail galaxies. We detect X-ray emission out to well beyond the virial radius, R100=2.2 deg. We do not find obvious evidence for the bow shock several hundred kpc south of the cluster center predicted by previous numerical simulations of the Fornax cluster. Instead, we discover finger-like structures beyond R500 to the west and south-east that stretch out far beyond the virial radius. They might be due to gas being pushed outward by the previous merger with NGC 1404 or due to warm-hot gas infall along large-scale filaments. Intriguingly, we find the distributions of the other tracers -- galaxies and globular clusters -- to be correlated with the X-ray excess regions, favoring the latter infall scenario. Interestingly, we also discover an apparent Bridge of low surface brightness emission beyond the virial radius connecting to the Fornax A galaxy group, which is also traced by the member galaxy and globular cluster distribution. This X-ray Bridge furthermore approximately coincides with a region of enhanced Faraday depth detected previously. The gas distribution in the SLOW simulation shows similar features as those we have discovered with SRG/eROSITA.         |\n",

Our observations cover a phase within $\\sim 1-2$ days to $\\sim 290$ days after the explosion. SN 2021hpr is found to be a spectroscopically normal SN Ia, with an absolute B-band peak magnitude of $M_{max}(B) \\approx -19.16 \\pm 0.14$ mag and a post-peak decline rate of $\\Delta m_{15}(B)= 1.00 \\pm 0.01 $ mag. Early-time light curves showed a $\\sim 7.0 \\%$ excess emission compared to a homogeneously expanding fireball model, likely due to SN ejecta interacting with a companion or immediate circumstellar matter. The optical spectra of SN 2021hpr are overall similar to those of normal SNe Ia, but characterized by prominent detached high-velocity features (HVFs) of Si {\\sc ii} and Ca {\\sc ii} in the early phase. After examining a small sample of well-observed normal SNe Ia, we find that the HVFs are likely common for the subgroup with early-excess emission. The association of early bump feature with the HVFs could be attributed to density or abundance enhancement at the outer layer of the exploding star, likely as a result of interactions with companion$/$CSM or experiencing more complete burning. Nevertheless, the redshifted Fe {\\sc ii} and Ni {\\sc ii} lines in the nebular-phase spectra of SN 2021hpr, contrary to the blueshift trend seen in other SNe Ia showing early bump features, indicate its peculiarity in the explosion that remains to be understood.         |\n",

       "|**Abstract**|            The new era of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy will significantly improve our understanding of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) by providing precise constraints on its underlying physical properties. However, spectral fitting requires reasonable assumptions on the thermal and chemical distributions of the gas. We use the output of TNG-Cluster, the newest addition to the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations, to provide theoretical expectations for the multi-phase nature of the ICM across hundreds of z=0 clusters (M$_{500c}$ = 10$^{14.0-15.3}$ M$_\\odot$) based upon a realistic model for galaxy formation and evolution. We create and analyse, in an observer-like manner, end-to-end XRISM/Resolve mock observations towards cluster centres. We then systematically compare the intrinsic properties of the simulated gas with the inferred ones from spectral fitting via a variety of commonly used spectral-emission models. Our analysis suggests that models with a distribution of temperatures, such as bvlognorm and bvgadem, better describe the complex thermal structure of the ICM, as predicted by TNG-Cluster, but incur biases of 0.5-2 keV (16th-84th percentiles). The 1T bvapec is too simplistic for the predicted broad temperature distributions, while a 2T double bvapec model systematically fails to capture the input temperature structure. However, all spectral emission models systematically underestimate the Fe abundance of the central ICM by ~0.1 Solar (~ 20 per cent) primarily due to projection effects. Selecting only strong cool core clusters leads to minor improvements on inference quality, removing the majority of outliers but maintaining similar overall biases and cluster-to-cluster scatter.         |\n",

       "|**Abstract**|            Luminous broad H$\\alpha$ emission and red rest-optical SEDs are the hallmark of compact Little Red Dots (LRDs), implying highly attenuated dusty starbursts and/or obscured active galactic nuclei. However, the lack of observed FIR emission has proved difficult to reconcile with the implied attenuated luminosity in these models. Here, we utilize deep new ALMA imaging, new and existing JWST/MIRI imaging, and archival Spitzer/Herschel imaging of two of the rest-optically brightest LRDs ($z=3.1$ and $z=4.47$) to place the strongest constraints on the IR luminosity in LRDs to date. The detections at $\\lambda_\\mathrm{rest}=1-4 \\ \\mu$m imply flat slopes in the rest-IR, ruling out a contribution from hot ($T\\gtrsim500$ K) dust. Similarly, FIR non-detections rule out any appreciable cold ($T\\lesssim75$ K) dust component. Assuming energy balance, these observations are inconsistent with the typical FIR dust emission of dusty starbursts and quasar torii, which usually show a mixture of cold and hot dust. Additionally, our [$\\mathrm{C}_{II}$] non-detections rule out typical dusty starbursts. We compute empirical maximum IR SEDs and find that both LRDs must have $\\log(L_\\mathrm{IR}/L_\\odot) \\lesssim 12.2$ at the $3\\sigma$ level. These limits are in tension with the predictions of rest-optical spectrophotometric fits, be they galaxy only, AGN only, or composite. It is unlikely that LRDs are highly dust-reddened intrinsically blue sources with a dust temperature distribution that conspires to avoid current observing facilities. Rather, we favor an intrinsically redder LRD SED model that alleviates the need for strong dust attenuation.         |\n",

We outline the statistical framework for deriving these quantities, its implementation, and various Galactic priors over the 3-D distribution of stars, stellar properties, and dust extinction (including $R_V$ variation). We establish a procedure to empirically calibrate MIST v1.2 isochrones by using open clusters to derive corrections to the effective temperatures and radii of the isochrones, which reduces systematic errors on the lower main sequence. We also describe and apply a method to estimate photometric offsets between stellar models and observed data using nearby, low-reddening field stars. We perform a series of tests on mock and real data to examine parameter recovery with MIST under different modeling assumptions, illustrating that brutus is able to recover distances and other stellar properties using optical to near-infrared photometry and astrometry.

This is a substantial improvement over distance estimates derived from Gaia parallaxes alone and in line with results from previous work. We find the fits are able to accurately reproduce the de-reddened Gaia color-magnitude diagram, which serves as a useful consistency check of our results. We show that we are able to clearly detect large, kinematically-coherent substructures in our data relative to the input priors, including the Monoceros Ring and the Sagittarius stream, attesting to the quality of the catalog. Our results are publicly available at doi:https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/WYMSXV. An accompanying interactive visualization can be found at this http URL.         |\n",

       "**Abstract:** We report the spectroscopic confirmation of a merging pair of massive quiescent galaxies at $z=3.44$ . Using $* JWST*$ observations, we confirm that the two galaxies lie at a projected separation of 4.5 kpc with a velocity offset of $\\sim 680$ $\\kms$ ( $\\delta_z \\sim 0.01$ ). The pair resides in the core of a known rich overdensity of galaxies, dubbed the \"Cosmic Vine\". For both pair members, modeling of the Spectral Energy Distributions and faint rest-frame optical emission lines indicate high stellar masses ( $\\log{(M_\\star/M_\\odot)}\\sim10.9$ ) and suppressed star formation ( $\\log{\\rm (sSFR/yr^{-1})}<-10$ ), more than an order of magnitude below the level of the star formation main sequence at this redshift. We then explore the Illustris-TNG simulation and the GAEA and SHARK semi-analytical models to examine whether they produce a pair of massive quiescent galaxies akin to that of the Cosmic Vine. While all models produce close pairs of massive quiescent galaxies at $2<z<4$ with comparable separations and velocity offsets, their predicted number densities are 10–80 times lower than our observational constraint. This discrepancy cannot be fully explained by coarse time sampling in these models or the general challenge of forming early massive quiescent galaxies in simulations. Given that $>90$ \\% of simulated pairs in the models that we analyzed merge by $z=0$ , our findings suggest that our observed pair will likely coalesce into a single massive galaxy. The merger, occurring in the dense core of a large-scale structure, might represent a critical event in the formation of a brightest cluster galaxy and the morphological transformation of high-redshift disky quiescent galaxies into early-type ellipticals.\n",

       "**Abstract:** In addition to the hot intracluster medium, massive galaxy clusters host complex, multi-phase gaseous halos. In this work, we quantify the abundance, spatial distribution, and origin of the cool ( $T\\leq10^{4.5} \\rm{K}$ ) gas within clusters. To do so, we combine the TNG-Cluster and TNG300 cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations, yielding a sample of 632 simulated galaxy clusters at $z=0$ with masses $M_{200c} \\sim 10^{14-15.4} \\rm{M_\\odot}$ . We find that cool gas is present in every cluster at $z=0$ , although it constitutes only a small fraction of the total gas mass within twice the virial radius, ranging from $\\sim 10^{-4}$ to a few per cent. The majority of cool gas resides in the cluster outskirts in infalling satellites and other halos. More rarely, cool gas can also be present in the central regions of clusters. More massive halos contain larger amounts (but not fractions) of cool gas ( $\\sim 10^{10-12} \\rm{M_\\odot}$ ), and we identify correlations between cluster cool gas fraction and several global halo and galaxy properties at fixed halo mass. Using Monte-Carlo Lagrangian tracer particles, we then track the origin of cool gas in present-day clusters. We find that the primary source is recent accretion at $z \\lesssim 0.1$ , predominantly in the form of pre-cooled gas carried by infalling satellite galaxies and other halos. However, in-situ cooling of the hot intracluster medium gas accreted at earlier epochs also contributes, especially in present-day cool-core clusters.\n",

       "**Abstract:** The TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations, produce a diverse population of X-ray cavities in the intracluster medium (ICM) of simulated galaxy clusters. These arise from episodic, high velocity, kinetic energy injections from the central active supermassive black hole (AGN, SMBH). Here, we present the first comprehensive comparative analysis of X-ray cavities in TNG-Cluster with observational data. First, we select a volume-limited sample of 35 real clusters ( $z \\leq 0.071$ , M $_\\text{500c}$ = 10 $^{14-14.8}$ M $_\\odot$ ) observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, identify 3 analogs for each in TNG-Cluster (total of 105) and generate mock Chandra images using same exposure times as their observed counterparts. We identify X-ray cavities and measure their properties in both datasets using identical techniques, ensuring a direct, apples-to-apples comparison. Our analysis reveals that both samples have a similar fraction of X-ray cavities (35-43 per cent). They exhibit comparable sizes and morphologies, although the sizes of simulated X-ray cavities still attached to the SMBH are somewhat larger in TNG-Cluster -- a scarcity at $< 10$ kpc. The area of TNG X-ray cavities increases as they rise in the ICM, consistent with the trend seen in the observational sample. The cavity powers, estimated using observational techniques, show good agreement between the two samples (10 $^{42-45}$ erg s $^{-1}$ ), suggesting that X-ray cavities in the simulation are an important heating mechanism in cluster cores. Overall, the rather simple AGN feedback model of TNG, with no model choices made to reproduce X-ray morphological features, and without cosmic rays, creates a quantitatively realistic population of X-ray cavities at cluster scales.\n",

       "**Abstract:** In this study, we examine the frequency and physical drivers of transformations from cool-core (CC) into non-cool-core (NCC) clusters, and vice versa, in a sample of 352 massive galaxy clusters ( $\\mvir = 10^{14-15.3} \\msun$ ) from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation of galaxies. By identifying transformations based on the evolution of central entropy and focusing on $z\\lesssim2.5$ , we find that clusters frequently undergo such events, depending on their diverse assembly and supermassive black hole (SMBH) histories. On average, clusters experience two to three transformations. Transformations can occur in both directions and can be temporary, but those to higher entropy cores, i.e. in the qualitative direction from CC to NCC states, are the overwhelming majority. CC phases are also shorter than NCC phases, and thus overall the TNG-Cluster population forms with low-entropy cores and moves towards NCC states as cosmic time progresses. We study the role that mergers play in driving transformations, and find that mergers within $\\sim 1$ Gyr prior to a transformation towards higher (but not lower) entropy cores occur statistically more often than in a random control sample. Most importantly, we find examples of mergers associated with cool-cores disruption regardless of their mass ratio or angular momentum. However, past merger activity is not a good predictor for $z=0$ CC status, at least based on core entropy, even though clusters undergoing more major and minor mergers eventually have the highest core entropy values at $z=0$ . We therefore consider the interplay between AGN feedback and evolving cluster core thermodynamics. We find that core transformations are accompanied by an increase in AGN activity, whereby frequent and repeated (kinetic) energy injections from the central SMBHs can produce a collective, long-term impact on central entropy, ultimately heating cluster cores. Whether such fast-paced periods of AGN activity are triggered by mergers is plausible, but not necessary.\n",

       "**Figure 13. -** Representative time evolution of the central cooling state of a massive galaxy cluster. In particular, the central entropy of the most massive $z=0$ halo in TNG-Cluster is given by the circular symbols (color indicating relaxedness, in terms of the ratio of kinetic to thermal energy within $\\rvir$). Correspondingly, the light gray line shows the smoothed time evolution of $K_0$, while the dark gray curve shows its time derivative. Local extrema of the derivative are indicated by crosses, with larger orange crosses marking significant core transformation events (see text). The blue markers indicate the timescales or duration of the two core transformations (see text for a definition). This halo undergoes a core transformation between $z \\sim 0.3-0.5$ wherein the core evolves towards a more cool-core (CC) state. In this case the transformation is temporary and lasts $\\sim 2-3$ Gyr, after which the central entropy returns to its previous level. This type of behavior is one of several archetypes (see text for discussion). The pink stars mark the start of the three most massive merger events in the history of this cluster. The size of the markers indicate the mass ratio of the merging event. We mark the formation time of the cluster with the silver vertical, dashed line. Note that throughout the paper, time evolves from right to left in all plots that depict a time evolution. (*fig:K0vsTime*)\n",

       "**Abstract:** Outflows are a key element in the baryon cycle of galaxies, impacting their evolution by extracting gas, momentum, energy, and then injecting them into the surrounding medium.  The properties of gas outflows provide a fundamental test for our models of how galaxies transition from a phase of active star formation to quiescence. Here we report the detection of outflowing gas signatures in two recently quenched, massive ( $M_\\star \\sim 10^{10.2} M_\\odot$ ) galaxies at $z=4.106$ ( $\\snhope$ ) and $z=7.276$ ( $\\rubies$ ) observed at rest-frame ultra-violet (UV) to near-infrared wavelengths with JWST/NIRSpec. The outflows are traced by blue-shifted magnesium (MgII) absorption lines, and in the case of the $z=4.1 $ system, also by  iron (FeII) and sodium (NaI) features. Together, these transitions broadly trace the chemically enriched neutral phase of the gaseous medium. The rest-frame optical spectra of the two sources are similar to those of local post-starburst galaxies, showing deep Balmer stellar features, relatively low $D_{\\rm n}4000$ index, and minimal ongoing star formation on 10 Myr timescales as traced by the lack of bright nebular and recombination emission lines, also suggesting the absence of a strong and radiatively efficient AGN activity. The galaxies' star formation histories are consistent with a recent and abrupt quenching of star formation, which continued at rates of $\\sim15$ $\\myr$ averaged over the last 100 Myr of their life. In the case of $\\snhope$ , dedicated millimeter observations allow us to strongly constrain also the dust obscured SFR to $<12$ $\\myr$ , unambiguously confirming its quiescence. Under simple geometrical assumptions, we derive mass loading factors $\\eta=\\dot{M}_{\\rm out}/\\mathrm{SFR_{100 Myr}}\\lesssim1$ and $\\sim50$ for the $z=4.1$ and $z=7.3$ systems, respectively, and similarly different  energy carried by the outflows ( $\\dot{E}_{\\rm out} \\lesssim5\\times10^{40}$ and $\\sim2\\times10^{42} \\mathrm{erg} \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ). Supernovae feedback can account for the mass and energy of the outflow in $\\snhope$ . However, the low mass loading factor and average gas velocity ( $\\sim180$ $\\kms$ , lower than the stellar velocity dispersion) suggest that the observed outflow is unlikely to be the primary reason behind the quenching of $\\snhope$ , but it might represent a relic of the star formation process winding down. Star formation-related processes seem to be also insufficient to explain the extreme mass outflow rate of $\\rubies$ , which would require an additional ejective mechanism such as an undetected AGN.  Finally, the average outflow velocities per unit stellar mass, SFR, or its surface area are consistent with those of lower-redshift post-starburst galaxies, suggesting that outflows in rapidly quenched galaxies might in substance occur similarly across cosmic time. Our findings hint at the existence of a rich tapestry of galaxy quenching pathways at high redshift, and they remark the importance of large spectroscopic samples mapping different spectral features to account for the different timescales on which different mechanisms contribute to this process.\n",
