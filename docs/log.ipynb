       "|**Abstract**|            A systematic, population-level discrepancy exists between the densities of exoplanets whose masses have been measured with transit timing variations (TTVs) versus those measured with radial velocities (RVs). Since the TTV planets are predominantly nearly resonant, it is still unclear whether the discrepancy is attributed to detection biases or to astrophysical differences between the nearly resonant and non resonant planet populations. We defined a controlled, unbiased sample of 36 sub-Neptunes characterised by Kepler, TESS, HARPS, and ESPRESSO. We found that their density depends mostly on the resonant state of the system, with a low probability (of $0.002_{-0.001}^{+0.010}$) that the mass of (nearly) resonant planets is drawn from the same underlying population as the bulk of sub-Neptunes. Increasing the sample to 133 sub-Neptunes reveals finer details: the densities of resonant planets are similar and lower than non-resonant planets, and both the mean and spread in density increase for planets that are away from resonance. This trend is also present in RV-characterised planets alone. In addition, TTVs and RVs have consistent density distributions for a given distance to resonance. We also show that systems closer to resonances tend to be more co-planar than their spread-out counterparts. These observational trends are also found in synthetic populations, where planets that survived in their original resonant configuration retain a lower density; whereas less compact systems have undergone post-disc giant collisions that increased the planet's density, while expanding their orbits. Our findings reinforce the claim that resonant systems are archetypes of planetary systems at their birth.         |"

       "|**Abstract**|            Ionization drives important chemical and dynamical processes within protoplanetary disks, including the formation of organics and water in the cold midplane and the transportation of material via accretion and magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) flows. Understanding these ionization-driven processes is crucial for understanding disk evolution and planet formation. We use new and archival ALMA observations of HCO+, H13CO+, and N2H+ to produce the first forward-modeled 2D ionization constraints for the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. We include ionization from multiple sources and explore the disk chemistry under a range of ionizing conditions. Abundances from our 2D chemical models are post-processed using non-LTE radiative transfer, visibility sampling, and imaging, and are compared directly to the observed radial emission profiles. The observations are best fit by a modestly reduced CR ionization rate ($\\zeta_{CR}$ ~ 10$^{-18}$ s$^{-1}$) and a hard X-ray spectrum (hardness ratio [HR] = 0.3), which we associate with stellar flaring conditions. Our best-fit model under-produces emission in the inner disk, suggesting that there may be an additional mechanism enhancing ionization in DM Tau's inner disk. Overall, our findings highlight the complexity of ionization in protoplanetary disks and the need for high resolution multi-line studies.         |\n",

       "|**Abstract**|            Context. High frame-rate imaging was employed to mitigate the effects of atmospheric turbulence (seeing) in observations of globular cluster Terzan 5. Aims. High-precision time-series photometry has been obtained with the highest angular resolution so far taken in the crowded central region of Terzan 5, with ground-based telescopes, and ways to avoid saturation of the brightest stars in the field observed. Methods. The Electron-Multiplying Charge Coupled Device (EMCCD) camera installed at the Danish 1.54-m telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory was employed to produce thousands of short-exposure time images (ten images per second) that were stacked to produce the normal-exposure-time images (minutes). We employed difference image analysis in the stacked images to produce high-precision photometry using the DanDIA pipeline. Results. Light curves of 1670 stars with 242 epochs were analyzed in the crowded central region of Terzan 5 to statistically detect variable stars in the field observed. We present a possible visual counterpart outburst at the position of the pulsar J1748-2446N, and the visual counterpart light curve of the low-mass X-ray binary CX 3. Additionally, we present the discovery of 4 semiregular variables. We also present updated ephemerides and properties of the only RR Lyrae star previously known in the field covered by our observations in Terzan 5. Finally, we report a significant displacement of two sources by ~0.62 and 0.59 arcseconds with respect to their positions in previous images available in the literature.         |\n",

       "|**Abstract**|            We use a new method to estimate the injected mass composition of ultrahigh cosmic rays (UHECRs) at energies higher than 10 EeV. The method is based on comparison of the energy-dependent distribution of cosmic ray arrival directions as measured by the Telescope Array experiment (TA) with that calculated in a given putative model of UHECR under the assumption that sources trace the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe. As we report in the companion letter, the TA data show large deflections with respect to the LSS which can be explained, assuming small extra-galactic magnetic fields (EGMF), by an intermediate composition changing to a heavy one (iron) in the highest energy bin. Here we show that these results are robust to uncertainties in UHECR injection spectra, the energy scale of the experiment and galactic magnetic fields (GMF). The assumption of weak EGMF, however, strongly affects this interpretation at all but the highest energies E > 100 EeV, where the remarkable isotropy of the data implies a heavy injected composition even in the case of strong EGMF. This result also holds if UHECR sources are as rare as $2 \\times 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, that is the conservative lower limit for the source number density.         |\n",

       "|**Abstract**|            We report an estimation of the injected mass composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) at energies higher than 10 EeV. The composition is inferred from an energy-dependent sky distribution of UHECR events observed by the Telescope Array surface detector by comparing it to the Large Scale Structure of the local Universe. In the case of negligible extra-galactic magnetic fields the results are consistent with a relatively heavy injected composition at E ~ 10 EeV that becomes lighter up to E ~ 100 EeV, while the composition at E > 100 EeV is very heavy. The latter is true even in the presence of highest experimentally allowed extra-galactic magnetic fields, while the composition at lower energies can be light if a strong EGMF is present. The effect of the uncertainty in the galactic magnetic field on these results is subdominant.         |\n",

       "$A systematic, population-level discrepancy exists between the densities of exoplanets whose masses have been measured with transit timing variations (TTVs) versus those measured with radial velocities (RVs). Since the TTV planets are predominantly nearly resonant, it is still unclear whether the discrepancy is attributed to detection biases or to astrophysical differences between the nearly resonant and non resonant planet populations. We newcommandined a controlled, unbiased sample of \\nbpcontrolled   sub-Neptunes characterised by \\textit{Kepler}, TESS, HARPS, and ESPRESSO. We found that their density depends mostly on the resonant state of the system, with a low probability (of \\pcontrolledm  ) that the mass of (nearly) resonant planets is drawn from the same underlying population as the bulk of sub-Neptunes. Increasing the sample to 133 sub-Neptunes reveals finer details: the densities of resonant planets are similar and lower than non-resonant planets, and both the mean and spread in density increase for planets that are away from resonance. This trend is also present in RV-characterised planets alone. In addition, TTVs and RVs have consistent density distributions for a given distance to resonance. We also show that systems closer to resonances tend to be more co-planar than their spread-out counterparts. These observational trends are also found in synthetic populations, where planets that survived in their original resonant configuration retain a lower density; whereas less compact systems have undergone post-disc giant collisions that increased the planet's density, while expanding their orbits. Our findings reinforce the claim that resonant systems are archetypes of planetary systems at their birth.$\n",

       "$In order to understand the nature of these objects, it is crucial to constrain both their masses and radii, and, thus, their densities. The bulk of exoplanet discoveries is done by transit surveys such as \\textit{Kepler}/\\textit{K2} and TESS, which measure the planets' radii. Then, the mass is typically estimated using the radial velocity method (RVs). For compact multi-planetary systems, the mass$\n",
       "$can also be estimated using transit timing variations (TTVs).$\n",
       "$In particular, when the period ratio of two planets is close to commensurability, namely, P_{out}/P_{in} \\approx (k+q)/k, the planets can exhibit TTVs due to their proximity to the mean motion resonance (MMR). Despite their relative rarity  ([Fabrycky, Lissauer and Ragozzine 2014]()) , (nearly) resonant systems are over-represented in the population of planets with both mass and radius measurements because the four-year baseline of the \\textit{Kepler} mission allowed estimations of their masses through TTVs at no additional cost.$\n",
       "$Over the last decade, numerous studies \\citep[e.g.][]{WuLi2013,WeissMarcy2014,Steffen2016,MillsMazeh2017,HaLi2017,Cubillos2017,Millholland2019,Leleu2023,Adibekyan2024} have noted (and discussed), the apparent discrepancy in density between the planets characterised by TTVs and radial velocities RVs. However, the origin of this discrepancy remains unclear: it could be due to sensitivity biases inherent to each method, with photometry biased towards larger planets and radial velocity biased towards more massive planets. Recent results also showed that part of the TTV-characterised population had underestimated densities due to the difficulty of extracting transit timings for low-signal-to-noise ratio (low-S/N) transits  ([Leleu, Delisle and Udry 2023]()) . [ and Hadden (2017)]() put forward a selection bias as possible explanation, since TTVs tend to allow the characterisation of small planets on larger orbital periods (hence, cooler orbits) than the bulk of the RV characterisation. It has also been proposed that the systems characterised by RVs and TTVs formed in different environments, such as with different disk metallicity  ([Adibekyan, Sousa and Barros 2024]()) . {However, the differences in physical properties could be due to the orbital configuration in which the planets are embedded \\cite[e.g.][]{WeissMarcy2014,MillsMazeh2017,Goyal2023}, since TTVs mainly characterise  sub-Neptunes that are near mean motion resonances (MMRs), while the RV-characterised planets are more representative of the bulk of known exoplanets. } In this paper, we explore the possibility that there is an intrinsic connection between the densities of sub-Neptunes and their resonant orbital configurations.$\n",

       "$The population shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:full} is taken from the NASA Exoplanet Archive\\footnote{\\url{https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/}}. As of 5 March 2024, the catalogue had 695 planets for which the mass and radius, as well as the host mass, radius, effective temperature, and metallicity are given, along with their uncertainties. The host properties are required in order to check for possible correlations between these parameters and the densities of the planets. Restricting this population to close-in systems with periods in the 5-60 days range and radii between 2 and 4 R_{Earth} has reduced this number to 133. The lower limit of the period range is chosen to avoid {the lower part of the Neptunian desert, which is partly shaped by photoevaporation  ([ and Owen 2018]()) .}$\n",

       "$if the RV signature of the planets did not seem large enough.$\n",
       "$This selection process would lead to a bias in the literature towards higher masses and higher densities for RV-characterised planets.$\n",
       "$Using all sub-Neptunes in the 5-60 days range that were followed-up by HARPS or ESPRESSO, we show in Appendix \\ref{ap:controlled} that such bias is absent for planets whose radius is above 2.7R_{Earth}, since 93\\% (26 out of 28) of the followed-up planets in that radius range have published masses. These 20 RV-characterised planets are the first part of our controlled sample.$\n",
       "$For TTV-characterised planets, the mass-radius relation can strongly be affected by mass-eccentricity degeneracies [Lithwick, Xie and Wu (2012)]() and the manner in which the TTVs are extracted from the light curves  ([Leleu, Delisle and Udry 2023]()) . To address the first point, we only use planets whose mass estimations have been shown to be robust against mass and eccentricity degeneracy \\citep[e.g.][]{HaLi2017,Leleu2023}.$\n",
       "$Regarding the second point, [Leleu, Delisle and Udry (2023)]() showed that TTVs are typically correctly estimated by usual methods if the signal to noise ratio of individual transits (S/N_i) is high enough.$\n",
       "$As shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:SNRi}, we checked that the planets with radius above 2.7 had an S/N_i > 3.5, which ensures that their individual transit timing can robustly be recovered  ([Leleu, Delisle and Udry 2023]()) .$\n",
       "$Here also, it translates to the selection of stars that are bright enough and not overly active. If individual transits of planets can reliably be observed, there is no reason why we could not characterise denser planets, as their TTV signals would either be larger  ([Lithwick, Xie and Wu 2012]())  or faster  (NeVo2016) , depending on whether the pair is near or inside a MMR.$\n",
       "$We therefore newcommandine our controlled sample as the planets in the 2.7 to 4 R_{Earth} range in the mass-radius diagram (shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:controlled}). This sample, detailed in Table \\ref{tab:controlled} is made of \\nbpcontrolledres  (nearly) resonant planets and \\nbpcontrollednres  non-resonant planets. Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we estimated that the radius distributions of these two populations have a p_{value}=\\pcontrolledr   probability\\footnote{Median and uncertainties on the p_{value} are estimated by drawing 1000 samples assuming a Gaussian distribution for the radius of each planet, then computing the 0.16, 0.5, and 0.84th quantiles of the resulting p_{value} distribution.} to be drawn from the same underlying population. However, the probability that their masses have been drawn from the same underlying population is p_{value}=\\pcontrolledm. We then checked whether this discrepancy could be attributed to different stellar metallicities, equilibrium temperatures \\citep[e.g.][]{HaLi2017}, or stellar effective temperatures. With respect to all of these quantities, the two populations are similar, with p_{value} of \\pcontrolledteq, \\pcontrolledmet  , and \\pcontrolledteff  , respectively. Exploring possible 2D relations between these parameters, we performed 2D Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests  ([ and Peacock 1983]()) . These results are shown in Appendix \\ref{ap:controlled}. Across all our tests, the p_{value} involving the mass are lower than the rest by two orders of magnitudes.

       "$If the difference in density between (nearly) resonant and non-resonant planets is not due to observational or selection biases, nor to the type of star that the planets orbit, it must be a result of different formation and evolution pathways. For example, the (nearly) resonant planets could be puffier as a result of atmospheric inflation due to tidal heating  ([ and Millholland 2019](), [Millholland, Petigura and Batygin 2020]()) . This would arise if the (nearly) resonant have systematically larger eccentricities or planetary obliquities. This is supported by previous studies, which suggested that planets captured in mean-motion resonances might have their spin-axes tilted as a result of secular spin-orbit resonance capture during the orbital migration process  ([ and Millholland 2019](), [Millholland, Lara and Toomlaid 2024]()) .$\n",
       "$Another hypothesis is that resonant and non-resonant planets were formed in different locations with diverse formation conditions. For example, [ and Lee (2016)]() posited that most super-Earths and sub-Neptunes formed in situ in gas-poor discs towards the end of the disc lifetime. However, they suggested that the rarer class of low-density \"super-puff\" planets formed outside \\sim 1 AU and accreted thicker gaseous atmospheres due to more efficient cooling. Because they formed further out, they would have entered MMRs upon inward migration.$\n",
       "$Alternatively, lower densities for planets in MMRs is expected by the model known as `breaking the chains' \\citep[see section 4 of][]{Bean2021}.$\n",
       "$In that model, close-in systems of sub-Neptunes form in resonant chains due to the migration of planets in the protoplanetary discs and the positive torque at the inner edge of the disc \\citep[e.g.][]{GoTre1979,Weidenschilling1985,Masset2006,TePa2007}.$\n",
       "$Resonant chains can then become dynamically unstable after the gaseous disc dissipates  ([ and Terquem 2007](), [ and Ogihara 2009](), [Cossou, et. al 2014]()) .$\n",
       "$This model reproduces the observed period ratio and multiplicity distribution of the close-in sub-Neptune population if \\approx 95\\% of the chains become unstable after the disc dispersal  ([Izidoro, Ogihara and Raymond 2017]()) . Some of these instabilities lead to giant impacts which can eject part, or all, the primordial H/He atmospheres of the planets  ([ and Biersteker 2019]()) , resulting in non-resonant planets that are on average denser than their resonant counterpart.$\n",
       "$This scenario leads to a second observable: known resonant chains tend to be remarkably coplanar \\citep[e.g.][]{Agol2020,Leleu2021}, while planet-planet scattering is expected to increase the mutual inclination between planets. In Fig. \\ref{fig:DMMRDi} we show the minimum mutual inclination (i.e. assuming that the ascending nodes of all the planets are aligned in the sky) of all pairs of planets that were confirmed in the exoplanet archive. Here, we can also see that pairs further away from MMRs have a larger scatter in the mutual inclination, in agreement with the 'breaking the chains' model. We note that the actual trend might be stronger, since here we only measure the minimal mutual inclination, the impact parameter of (nearly) resonant systems could be biased by unaccounted TTVs  ([ and García-Melendo 2011]())  and misaligned, spread-out systems have a lower transit probability.$\n",
       "$The 'breaking the chains' mechanism \\citep[e.g.][]{Izidoro2017,Izidoro2022} is also observed in different planet formation models \\citep[e.g. NGPPS][]{Emsenhuber2021,Burn2024}.$\n",
       "$In Fig. \\ref{fig:models}, we show synthetic systems from [Izidoro, Bitsch and Raymond (2021)](), [Izidoro, Schlichting and Isella (2022)]() and NGPPS  ([Emsenhuber, Mordasini and Burn 2021](), [Burn, Mordasini and Mishra 2024]()) . These populations (described in Appendix \\ref{ap:Andre} and \\ref{ap:Remo}, respectively) simulate the formation of planetary systems from planet embryos in the proto-planetary discs up to \\sim50 millions of years after the disc dispersal. As can be seen in the middle panels, both populations harbour lower-density planets for the (nearly) resonant sub-population, while the non-resonant populations have larger and more diverse relative densities. The right panels show that the mutual inclination between each planet pairs tend to be larger for larger distance to MMRs. In both populations, these features are linked with post-disc instabilities and collision, shown with star markers in Fig. \\ref{fig:models}. These instabilities can be due to the configuration of the chain itself, but also to the existence of an outer more massive planet \\citep[see Appendix \\ref{ap:Remo} and also][]{Schlecker2021,Izidoro2022}. In addition, for the NGPPS population, the larger density of the non-resonant population is partially due to the accretion of more rocky embryos from the inner system during the giant impact stage after gas disk dissipation.$\n",
       "$\\section{Conclusion}$\n",
       "$\\label{sec:conclusion}$\n",
       "$Our results support the idea that the apparent discrepancy between TTV- and RV-characterised planets is astrophysical and due to different formation and evolution pathways of the characterised populations, rather than a method-related bias. The significance of the controlled sample (p_{value} of \\pcontrolledm) can be improved by a homogeneous analysis of the RV-characterised population, and a larger completion in the publication of mass measurement for smaller planets. For the TTVs, the population needs to be systematically checked for the mass or eccentricity degeneracies  ([ and Hadden 2017]())  and the robustness of the TTV extraction or the photo-dynamical analysis  ([Leleu, Delisle and Udry 2023]()) , as well as ensuring that small dense resonant planets are not missed due to large TTVs  ([Leleu, Chatel and Udry 2021](), [Leleu, Delisle and Mardling 2022]()) . In this study, we were also able to show that TTV and RV characterised planets had a similar relative density distribution for the nearly resonant population. A next step would be to get enough RV characterised resonant systems of sub-Neptunes, such as resonant chains, to check whether these results hold for that population. Finally, PLATO will enable the discovery and characterisation of systems by both TTVs and RVs, which should help to further alleviate the biases inherent to each method.$\n",

       "$As we can see in Fig. \\ref{fig:nb_equiv}, planets whose radius is below 2.7 R_{Earth} might be affected by a selection bias, as 24\\% of these have not been published.

       "$Our initial set of simulated planetary systems originates from [Izidoro, Schlichting and Isella (2022)](), building upon prior simulations of the 'breaking the chains' scenario  ([Izidoro, Ogihara and Raymond 2017](), [Izidoro, Bitsch and Raymond 2021]()) . These simulations track the formation of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes by tracing the evolution of Moon-mass planetary seeds within a circumstellar disk. Various physical processes are considered, including gas-assisted pebble accretion \\citep[e.g.][]{lambrechtsjohansen12}, gas-driven planet migration \\citep[e.g.][]{baruteauetal14}, gas tidal damping of orbital parameters \\citep[e.g.][]{cresswellnelson08}, and mutual gravitational interactions among planetary embryos.$\n",
       "$In [Izidoro, Bitsch and Raymond (2021)](), planetary seeds grow through pebble accretion and mutual collisions. Pebbles beyond the snowline are presumed to contain 50\\% water ice mass. As these pebbles migrate inward and cross the water snowline, they sublimate, losing their water component and releasing silicate grains.  Collisions are modelled as perfect merging events conserving mass and momentum.$\n",
       "$The planet formation simulations of [Izidoro, Bitsch and Raymond (2021)]() new planetary mass and composition but not planet size or radius. To compare the simulations outcome with observational trends involving planet sizes such as the exoplanet radius valley and the peas-in-a-pod trend, [Izidoro, Schlichting and Isella (2022)]() employ mass-radius relationships  ([Zeng, Jacobsen and Sasselov 2019]())  to convert mass into planetary radius. In addition,  in this model, giant impacts (with projectile-to-target mass ratios greater than 0.1) occurring after gas disk dispersal strip primordial atmospheres, leaving behind either bare rocky or water-rich cores  ([ and Biersteker 2019]()) . According to [Izidoro, Schlichting and Isella (2022)](), approximately 80-90\\% of late impacts qualify as giant impacts in their model. Their model does not account for the formation of secondary/outgassed atmospheres but for only for primordial atmospheres accreted during the gaseous disk phase (H/He rich).$\n",
       "$The stability of a primordial atmosphere for a planet that did not experience giant impacts after gas dispersal is estimated using an energy-limited escape prescription, considering stellar X-ray and ultraviolet radiation  ([ and Owen 2017]()) . The criterion by [ and Misener (2021)]() compares atmospheric binding energy to the energy received by the planet from 100 million to 1 billion years. An energy ratio smaller than unit indicates sufficient energy for atmosphere photo-evaporation. Planet sizes are computed following different planet models, which account, or not, for the presence of a primordial atmosphere following the atmospheric instability criterion of [ and Misener (2021)]().$\n",

       "$The second set of theoretical planetary system calculations was obtained from the planetary population synthesis exercise conducted by [Emsenhuber, Mordasini and Burn (2021)]() and updated by [Burn, Mordasini and Mishra (2024)](). This set of simulations use the Bern model of global planet formation and evolution  ([Emsenhuber, Mordasini and Burn 2021]()) . The starting point of the simulations are protoplanetary dust and solid disks around Solar-type stars with observation-informed distributions of initial conditions (\\citealp{Tychoniec2018}, see also the discussion in \\citealp{Emsenhuber2023}). The gas disk viscous surface density evolution equation  (Pringle1981)  is solved assuming an \\alpha-viscosity of 2\\times 10^{-3}, photoevaporative mass loss, and a consistent temperature structure using opacities from [ and Bell (1994)](), viscous and irradiation heating. Apart from 1\\% dust used as opacity source, the solid disk is assumed to be present in the form of planetesimals that are modelled as fluid and accreted by 100 growing seed embryos randomly distributed in the disk at initialisation. The composition of gas, embryos and planetesimals, initialised following [Marboeuf, et. al (2014)](), is tracked during planet growth. Gas accretion onto the planets proceeds by cooling and contraction of the previously accreted gas which is modelled in one dimension assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and energy release at the boundary between the solid core and the gaseous envelope. The simulations explicitly model gravitational interactions between the embryos using the \\texttt{mercury} code  ([ and Chambers 1999]())  where an additional force is added due to the interaction of the planets with the gaseous disk. The force is derived from prescriptions of type I  ([Paardekooper, et. al 2010](), [Paardekooper, Baruteau and Kley 2011]())  and II  ([Dittkrist, et. al 2014]())  migration timescales, as well as eccentricity and inclination damping  ([ and Coleman 2014]()) . This will commonly lead to an inwards movement at moderate excitation of the planets during the gas disk stage. If two embryos collide, we assume a perfect merging of the solid core (including volatile species) and immediate ejection of the hydrogen-helium envelope of the smaller of the two planets. The impact energy of the impacting core is then added as a luminosity source over a smoothing timescale on the core-envelope boundary of the larger target, which can lead to radius inflation and gas loss, namely, impact stripping. For a full description of the technical implementation, we refer to [Emsenhuber, Mordasini and Burn (2021)](). Here, we note that the perfect merging of volatiles, such as water, is a current model shortcoming and impact stripping of volatiles need to be included in future versions of the model. Nevertheless, the stripping of heavier water or carbon-bearing species is less efficient than that of the lighter hydrogen and helium  ([Burger, Bazsó and Schäfer 2020]()) .$\n",
       "$The evolution of the 1000 NGPPS planetary systems, following 100 Myr of N-body integration with the aforementioned model, was re-calculated by [Burn, Mordasini and Mishra (2024)]() considering an improved equation of state for water  ([Haldemann, et. al 2020]())  for each simulated planet individually. If water or other ices were present from the formation modelling, they are mixed with any H/He left at this stage. For simplicity, all volatile species are modelled as water. The revised internal structure modelling results in significantly different, larger, radii of volatile-rich planet due to the lower density of supercritical water. Over typically 0.1 Gyr timescales, the loss of the mixture is calculated using a mass-weighted mass loss rate of the two constituents due to high-energy irradiation by the star  ([Kubyshkina, Fossati and Erkaev 2018](), kubyshkina2021, Johnstone2020) . The fraction of elements in the envelope different from hydrogen and helium, Z_{\\rm env}, is kept constant motivated by numerical results in the regime of efficient mass loss  (Johnstone2020) . Here, we show the planetary population at an evolutionary age of 5 Gyr after star formation; however, we caution that due to computational limitations, the dynamical state represents a 100 Myr-old system and, in some cases, slightly varying masses (prior to atmospheric mass loss).$\n",

       "**Abstract:** A systematic, population-level discrepancy exists between the densities of exoplanets whose masses have been measured with transit timing variations (TTVs) versus those measured with radial velocities (RVs). Since the TTV planets are predominantly nearly resonant, it is still unclear whether the discrepancy is attributed to detection biases or to astrophysical differences between the nearly resonant and non resonant planet populations. We defined a controlled, unbiased sample of $\\nbpcontrolled$ sub-Neptunes characterised by _Kepler_ , TESS, HARPS, and ESPRESSO. We found that their density depends mostly on the resonant state of the system, with a low probability (of $\\pcontrolledm$ ) that the mass of (nearly) resonant planets is drawn from the same underlying population as the bulk of sub-Neptunes. Increasing the sample to 133 sub-Neptunes reveals finer details: the densities of resonant planets are similar and lower than non-resonant planets, and both the mean and spread in density increase for planets that are away from resonance. This trend is also present in RV-characterised planets alone. In addition, TTVs and RVs have consistent density distributions for a given distance to resonance. We also show that systems closer to resonances tend to be more co-planar than their spread-out counterparts. These observational trends are also found in synthetic populations, where planets that survived in their original resonant configuration retain a lower density; whereas less compact systems have undergone post-disc giant collisions that increased the planet's density, while expanding their orbits. Our findings reinforce the claim that resonant systems are archetypes of planetary systems at their birth.\n",
