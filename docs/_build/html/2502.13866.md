**Abstract:** Quantifying the accretion flow from large cloud scales down to individual protostars is a central ingredient to the understanding of (high-mass) star formation. We characterize and quantify this multi-scale flow for a prototypical high-mass star-forming region. In a multi-scale analysis from parsec to $\sim$ 50 au scales, we combined multiple single-dish and interferometric observations to study the gas flow from large-scale sizes of several parsec (Mopra) via intermediate-scale filamentary gas flows (ALMA-IMF) to the central cores (ALMA DIHCA and configuration 10 data). The highest-resolution multi-configuration ALMA dataset achieved a spatial resolution of $0.027"\times 0.022"$ or 50 au. This multi-scale study allows us to follow the gas from the  environment of the high-mass star-forming region ( $\sim$ 2 pc) via intermediate-scale ( $\sim$ 0.25 pc) filamentary gas flows down to the innermost cores within the central few 1000 au. The intermediate-scale filaments connect spatially and kinematically to the larger-scale cloud as well as the innermost cores. We estimate a filamentary mass inflow rate around $10^{-3}$ M $_{\odot}$ yr $^{-1}$ , feeding into the central region that hosts at least a dozen mm cores. While the flow from the cloud via the filaments down to 10 $^4$ au appears relatively ordered, within the central 10 $^4$ au the kinematic structures become much more complicated and disordered. We speculate that this is caused by the interplay of the converging infalling gas with feedback processes from the forming central protostars. This multi-scale study characterises and quantifies the hierarchical gas flow from clouds down to the central protostars for a prototypical infrared dark cloud with several embedded cores at an unprecedented detail. While comparatively ordered gas flows are found over a broad range of scales, the innermost area exhibits more disordered structures, likely caused by the combination of inflow, outflow and cluster dynamical processes.

**Figure 3. -** Zoom-in plots from the more central region in G351. The two left panels show the ALMA-IMF data \citep{motte2022,ginsburg2022,cunningham2023} from the first zoom-region (black box in Fig. \ref{g351_large}). The color-scale in the left and middle panels are the 1st moment maps in $H_2$CO and DCN. The contours show the 1.3 mm continuum emission starting at 4$\sigma$ and continue in 8$\sigma$ steps (1$\sigma$=0.6 mJy beam$^{-1}$). The ellipses in the middle panel outline the areas used for the mass flow rate estimates, and the red arrow shows the direction of the red-shifted outflow lobe from \citet{beuther2017b}. The right panel then shows the final zoom-in (magenta boxes in middle panel and Fig. \ref{g351_large}) data from the DIHCA and high-resolution studies \citep{olguin2021,beuther2019} with the $H_2$CO 1st moment map in color-scale and the 1.3 mm continuum data in contours (5 to 25$\sigma$ in 5$\sigma$ steps with 1$\sigma$=60 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$). The arrow in the right panel marks the direction of the position-velocity cut in Fig. \ref{pv_h2co}. Linear scale-bars are shown in the middle and right panels, synthesized beams are presented in the bottom- and top-left corners of the respective panels. (*ALMA-IMF*)

**Figure 4. -** Velocity structure of the central region. The left three panels show integrated $H_2$CO$(3_{2,2}-2_{2,1})$ maps for different velocity regimes as marked. The right panel presents a corresponding position-velocity cut from east to west along the line shown in the right panel of Fig. \ref{ALMA-IMF} and in the 2nd panel from left here. The dashed vertical lines in all panels mark the R.A. positions of the two central cores mm1 and mm2 (right and left dashed lines, respectively), where mm1 also drives a molecular outflow in northwest-southeast direction \citep{beuther2019}. The horizontal dashed line in the pv-diagram shows the $v_{\rm LSR}\sim -3.6$ km s$^{-1}$ from \citet{leurini2011}. Other features are marked and labeled.  (*pv_h2co*)

**Figure 1. -** Overview of the G351 region. The left panel shows in color-scale the Spitzer 8 $\mu$m emission \citep{churchwell2009} and in contours the ATLASGAL 870 $\mu$m emission \citep{schuller2009}. Contour levels start at the 4$\sigma$ level of 240 mJy beam$^{-1}$. The middle and right panels present the molecular emission from the HCO$^+$(1--0)  and $N_2$H$^+$(1--0) lines observed with the MALT90 survey \citep{jackson2013}. In both cases, the color-scale shows the 1st moment maps (intensity-weighted peak velocities), and the contours present the integrated line emission or 0th moment from 5 to 95\% of the respective peak emission. For $N_2$H$^+$(1--0), the 1st moment map is from the isolated hyperfine component shifted by +8.0 km s$^{-1}$ to the $v_{\rm{lsr}}$. Since the rms increases toward the map edges, we masked the emission outside the 5\% 0th moment map for the $N_2$H$^+$(1--0) map.  The black and magenta boxes in the middle and right panels outline the areas shown in the following ALMA-IMF and ALMA central core images. Linear scale-bars are shown in the left and right panels, and the MALT90 beams are presented in the bottom corners. (*g351_large*)
