**Abstract:** We present a catalogue of 497 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses in the Euclid Quick Release 1 data (63 deg $^2$ ). In the initial 0.45 \% of $\Euclid$ 's surveys, we double the total number of known lens candidates with space-based imaging. Our catalogue includes 250 grade A candidates,  the vast majority of which (243) were previously unpublished. $\Euclid$ 's resolution reveals rare lens configurations of scientific value including double-source-plane lenses, edge-on lenses, complete Einstein rings, and quadruply-imaged lenses. We resolve lenses with small Einstein radii ( $\theta_{\rm E} < \ang{;;1}$ ) in large numbers for the first time. These lenses are found through an initial sweep by deep learning models, followed by Space Warps citizen scientist inspection, expert vetting, and system-by-system modelling. Our search approach scales straightforwardly to Euclid Data Release 1 and, without changes, would yield approximately $\num{7000}$ high-confidence (grade A or B) lens candidates by late 2026. Further extrapolating to the complete Euclid Wide Survey implies a likely yield of over $\num{100000}$ high-confidence candidates, transforming strong lensing science.

**Figure 13. -** Strong lens candidates as a function of expert visual inspection score. Random subset shown for conciseness (140 of 500). We refer to a score above 2.0 as Grade A and above 1.5 as Grade B in this work, but suggest that readers choose their own selection cut according to their science goals. (*fig:lens_subset_by_score*)

**Figure 3. -** A random subset of score trajectories for test (grey) and training subjects (lenses: blue, non-lenses: red) in the Space Warps lens search. Subject which are voted as lenses (non-lenses) by citizens move towards the right (left), and users with higher skill can cause larger changes in score when they classify a subject. The vast majority of training subjects were correctly classified by the citizens. Subjects reaching the shaded region were removed from the platform to increase the efficiency of classification.

**Figure 1. -** Lens-finding capabilities of \Euclid compared to recent surveys. We show the number of A/B grade lenses detected per deg$^2$ vs. total survey area in deg$^2$, with contours of constant total lenses detected. The `Euclid Q1' datapoint uses lenses detected in this series of works. Estimates for Euclid DR1 and Euclid Wide multiply our rate of detected lenses with the appropriate area; see Sect. \ref{sc:conclusion_and_outlook} for detailed forecasting scenarios. All numbers are approximate due to the subjective nature of grading and the varying details of each search approach, and from searches focusing on galaxy-galaxy lenses in alignment with this series of works.
