**Abstract:** Young, massive stellar clusters offer a prime setting to explore brown dwarf (BD) formation under high densities and intense UV radiation. Trumpler 14 (Tr 14), a $\sim$ 1 Myr-old cluster located at a distance of 2.4 kpc, and particularly rich in O-type stars, is an ideal target for such a study. Our goal is to measure the initial mass function (IMF) in the young massive, high UV flux cluster. We present the deepest study to date of the IMF in Tr 14 based on  Gemini Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics System/ Gemini-South Adaptive Optics Imager imaging. We construct the IMF using both the Besançon Galactic model and an observational control field from VISTA for background correction. Completeness was assessed using artificial-star tests and applied to the IMF derivation. We estimate the IMF down to the 20 \% completeness limit found at $\sim 0.01 M_\odot$ . Using the control field-based IMF as our primary result, we find a slope of $\alpha=0.14\pm0.19$ for masses between 0.01–0.2 $M_\odot$ , and $\alpha=1.72\pm0.04$ for 0.2–4.5 $M_\odot$ , where $dN/dM \propto M^{-\alpha}$ . The low-mass slope is largely influenced by the incompleteness-affected lowest bin; excluding it brings our results into agreement with those from other young clusters. The resulting median for the star-to-BD ratio in the $0.03-1 M_\odot$ mass range is 4.0, with a 95 \% confidence interval of 2.8-5.8. Our analysis reveals that Tr 14 hosts a relatively flat substellar IMF, but this is strongly influenced by the lowest-mass bin, which may be affected by incompleteness. When that bin is excluded, the IMF becomes consistent with those of other regions. The star-to-BD ratio falls within the usually observed $\sim$ 3–6 range, indicating that brown dwarfs with masses above $\sim$ 0.03 $M_\odot$ form with similar efficiency across environments. However, the relative lack of objects below this threshold suggests that the presence of an environment with both high stellar density and FUV flux may play a role in shaping the IMF by suppressing the formation of BDs at masses $<0.03 M_\odot$ .

**Figure 7. -** CMDs for the Besançon model in the upper panels and VISTA CF in the lower panels. The black dots show all the objects in the line of sight of Tr 14 in all panels. The grey dots are the model foreground, while the red ones are the reddened model background. The amount of reddening is given above each corresponding panel. The orange dots represent the reddened CF. Again, the amount of reddening is given above each panel. Each extinction is chosen to decontaminate the most amount of background sources. (*fig:CF*)

**Figure 6. -** Left and central panel show the CMDs. The mean uncertainty is in the upper right part of the panels. The red solid line represents the 1 Myr isochrone combined from the PARSEC and BT-Settl models at 1 $M_\odot$(\citealt{bressan2012parsec, chen2014improving, baraffe2015new}). The reddening vector of Av=3 mag is shown  {\citep{extinction_law}}. The dashed black line in the first two panels represents the 90\% completeness limit, while the dotted black line represents the 50\% completeness limit and the solid black line the 20\% completeness limit. The right panel represents the  colour- colour diagram (CCD). The solid red line is the isochrone as in the CMDs. The dashed red lines are parallel to extinction vectors, while the red crosses represent Av=0, 5 and 10 mag. The dashed-dotted magenta line represents the T-Tauri stars locus with the corresponding uncertainties as blue dashed lines \citep{meyer+1997}, transformed to 2MASS system using \cite{carpenter_color_2001}. The average uncertainty is in the lower-right corner in the right-most panel, in other panels it is up right. The starting points for the left and middle reddening vector are determined by the masses in the model (<0.5 $M_\odot$ and >=0.005 $M_\odot$, respectively) while the right reddening vector is from \cite{muzic2017}, adapting the locus of Herbig AeBe stars from \cite{Hernandez_2005}.

**Figure 9. -** Example of mass derivation for one of the sources. The first two panels display the 1 Myr isochrone (red solid line) combined from the PARSEC and BT-Settl models at 1 $M_\odot$ mass (\citealt{bressan2012parsec, chen2014improving, baraffe2015new}) and the source with its error bars (orange solid cross). The grey dots represent the generated magnitude points from 1000 runs. In the first panel a line parallel to the extinction vector would show where the mass lies on the model. In the second panel, the red dotted lines are parallel to the reddening vectors. Red crosses mark the extinction in 5 mag steps from 0 to 15 mag. The third and the fourth panel display the mass and extinction distribution, respectively, obtained from 1000 runs. (*fig:mass_ext*)
