**Abstract:** We present the first determination of the Galactic stellar mass function (MF) for low-mass stars ( $0.2-0.5 {\rm M}_\odot$ ) at metallicities [ Fe/H ] $\lesssim -1$ . A sample of $\sim$ 53,000  stars was selected as metal-poor on the basis of both their halo-like orbits and their spectroscopic [ Fe/H ] from Gaia DR3 BP/RP (XP) spectra. These metallicity estimates for low-mass stars were enabled by calibrating Gaia XP spectra with stellar parameters from SDSS-V.For $-1.5<$ [ Fe/H ] $<$ -1, we find that the MF below 0.5 ${\rm M}_\odot$ exhibits a "bottom-heavy" power-law slope of $\alpha \sim -1.6$ . We tentatively find that at even lower metallicities, the MF becomes very bottom-light, with a near-flat power-law slope of $\alpha \sim 0$ that implies a severe deficit of low-mass stars. This metallicity-dependent variation is insensitive to the adopted stellar evolution model. These results show that the Galactic low-mass MF is not universal, with variations in the metal-poor regime.A further calibration of XP metallicities in the regime of $M<0.5 M_{\odot}$ and [ Fe/H ] $<-1.5$ will be essential to verify these tentative low-metallicity trends.

**Figure 6. -** Color-Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs) of the Gaia XP sample.
    _Left:_  The CMD of Gaia sources within 1 kpc is color-coded by $\eta$, defined in Eq. \ref{eq:eta}, which is the likelihood that a star's orbit is halo-like rather than disk-like. Blue colors denote stars that are more likely to be on halo-like orbits.
    _Right:_ CMD of the sample with halo-like orbits ($\eta>10$), color-coded by XP-derived metallicity.
    Typical absolute-magnitude error is dominated by distance uncertainties, with $\sigma_{M_G}\approx 0.08 \mathrm{mag}$ at $d=800 \mathrm{pc}$.
    The gray background represents sources within 100 pc.
    The dot--dashed colored lines show loci from the PARSEC stellar evolution models evaluated at a fixed age of 5 Gyr for different metallicities. The black dotted lines indicate iso-mass lines from the PARSEC models.

**Figure 8. -** 
    Stellar mass functions for the metal-poor sample.
    The logarithmic mass density, $\log_{10}\Phi$[number kpc$^{-3}$ M$_\odot^{-1}$], is shown as a function of stellar mass $M$ for different metallicity bins (color-coded by [Fe/H], see color bar).
    Stellar masses are derived from PARSEC models (solid lines) and BaSTI models (dotted lines).
    Symbols show the binned densities with shaded bands indicating $1\sigma$ uncertainties.
    The dashed gray line shows the canonical Kroupa IMF, scaled for visual comparison.
    The mass ratio, $\xi_{\mathrm{MR}}$, as a function of [Fe/H].
    The ratio $\xi_{\mathrm{MR}}$ is defined as the stellar mass fraction between $0.2 {\rm M}_\odot$ and $0.5 {\rm M}_\odot$ relative to the mass between $0.2 {\rm M}_\odot$ and $0.7 {\rm M}_\odot$.
    Our results for metal-poor stars are shown as blue symbols for individual metallicity bins (stars).  These are compared against a compilation of literature data (other colored symbols). The horizontal black-dashed and grey-dotted lines represent the values for canonical Kroupa and Salpeter IMFs, respectively. The metallicity-dependent model from \cite{yan2024} is shown as a grey dash-dot curve. The shaded grey area shows the metal-poor regime with [Fe/H]$<-1.1$. (*fig:smf*)
