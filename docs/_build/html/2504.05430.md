**Abstract:** Power spectra (PS) of high-resolution images of M51 (NGC 5194) taken with the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope have been examined for evidence of disk thickness in the form of a change in slope between large scales, which map two-dimensional correlated structures, and small scales, which map three-dimensional correlated structures. Such a slope change is observed here in H $\alpha$ , and possibly Pa $\alpha$ , using average PS of azimuthal intensity scans that avoid bright peaks.  The physical scale of the slope change occurs at $\sim120$ pc and $\sim170$ pc for these two transitions, respectively.  A radial dependence in the shape of the H $\alpha$ PS also suggests that the length scale drops from $\sim180$ pc at 5 kpc, to $\sim90$ pc at 2 kpc, to $\sim25$ pc in the central $\sim$ kpc. We interpret these lengths as comparable to the thicknesses of the star-forming disk traced by HII regions.  The corresponding emission measure is $\sim100$ times larger than what is expected from the diffuse ionized gas. PS of JWST Mid-IR Instrument (MIRI) images in 8 passbands have more gradual changes in slope, making it difficult to determine a specific value of the thickness for this emission.

**Figure 4. -** PS (top) and their running slopes (bottom) for H$\alpha$(left), Pa$\alpha$(middle), and eight mid-infrared passbands (right). The curves are shifted upward for clarity with slope zero-levels in the bottom panels indicated by circles.  For H$\alpha$ and Pa$\alpha$, the top curves in each panel have the lowest intensity limits and the smallest numbers of scans in the average PS, and the bottom curves in each panel have all the scans, excluding only those with negative intensity peaks. The 8 PS on the right correspond to the 8 near-infrared bands, as labeled in the bottom panel; each is from an average of the PS with the lowest intensity peaks.  A slight break at a size of $1/k\sim120$ pc is visible in the top three H$\alpha$ PS (at the vertical black line). A weaker break at $\sim170$ pc is in some of the Pa$\alpha$ PS. The mid-infrared PS on the right have a more gradual change in slope; there is no obvious break but a vertical line shows 100 pc. The running slopes in the bottom panels show sudden changes at the positions of the PS breaks. The horizontal black lines are least-square fits to the PS slopes at wavenumbers below the suggested breaks and at wavenumbers above the breaks and up to the value of $k/k_0$ corresponding to 5 times the FWHM of the PSF. The mid-infrared passbands on the right have little or no span of PS from the fiducial scale of 100 pc to the PSF. The cyan curve in the top left panel is the PS of an H$\alpha$ intensity scans with a bright point-like source.  Radial ranges for the PS are indicated in the top panel.

**Figure 1. -** (Left:) Image of M51 in H$\alpha$ with concentric circles at sample radii of azimuthal intensity scans used to derive the PS. The circles are spaced by 600 pixels, which is 200 scans, $24^{\prime\prime}$, or 872 pc. A small circle midway between the 4th and 5th annuli below the center has a diameter corresponding to 200 pc. (Right:) H$\alpha$ with circles at $16^{\prime\prime}$, $35^{\prime\prime}$, $80^{\prime\prime}$, and $180^{\prime\prime}$ used to determine the radial intervals for separate evaluations of thickness. The images are plotted as log of the intensity. The scale bar indicates 1 kpc.

**Figure 3. -** Left: H$\alpha$ Intensity scans (with the indicated interval in units of $10^{-13}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$, top) and power spectra (in the square of these units, bottom) corresponding approximately to the positions of the circles in Fig. \ref{fig:hacircles}. Both are shifted vertically by arbitrary amounts for clarity.  The intensity ordinate is a linear scale with one unit shown; factors of 2 and 20 compressions are used for the 2nd and 3rd scans up from the bottom.  The PS ordinate shows the 10 unit scale, which means the PS covers a range of $10^{10}$ in that interval. The lengths of the scans increase with radius. Right: Intensity scans (top) and PS (bottom) also corresponding to radii near the circles in Fig. \ref{fig:hacircles}, but chosen to avoid strong sources. The PS in the lower left are irregular. For example, they are flat at low $\log k/k_0$ when there are exceptionally strong sources in the scans. When there are no strong sources, the PS (lower right) are more uniform and may be averaged to give a better composite PS.
