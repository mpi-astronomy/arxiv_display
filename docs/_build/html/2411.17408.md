**Abstract:** In an ongoing effort to understand planet formation the link between the chemistry of the protoplanetary disk and the properties of resulting planets have long been a subject of interest. These connections have generally been made between mature planets and young protoplanetary disks through the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. In a rare number of systems, young protoplanets have been found within their natal protoplanetary disks. These systems offer a unique opportunity to directly study the delivery of gas from the protoplanetary disk to the planet. In this work we post-process 3D numerical simulations of an embedded Jupiter-massed planet in its protoplanetary disk to explore the chemical evolution of gas as it flows from the disk to the planet. The relevant dust to this chemical evolution is assumed to be small, co-moving grains with a reduced dust-to-gas ratio indicative of the upper atmosphere of a protoplanetary disk. We find that as the gas enters deep into the planet's gravitational well, it warms significantly (up to $\sim 800$ K), releasing all of the volatile content from the ice phase. This change in phase can influence our understanding of the delivery of volatile species to the atmospheres of giant planets. The primary carbon, oxygen, and sulfur carrying ices: $CO_2$ , $H_2$ O, and $H_2$ S are released into the gas phase and along with the warm gas temperatures near the embedded planets lead to the production of unique species like CS, SO, and $SO_2$ compared to the protoplanetary disk. We compute the column densities of SO, $SO_2$ , CS, and $H_2$ CS  in our model and find that their values  are consistent with previous observational studies.

**Figure 11. -** Evolution of the most abundant oxygen bearing species for the 3 test streamlines. The solid lines represent the gas phase of each species while the dashed lines represent the ice species. $CH_2$$O_2$ represents the most abundant `organic' species in the CPD. Note the change in y-axis range between the top and bottom rows. For water and $CH_2$$O_2$ the opacity of the line for $t>40$ orbits is slowly reduced to better see the other lines on the plot.

**Figure 8. -** Example of some of the streamlines by the embedded planet. Three types of streamlines are shown: one misses the CPD completely [(1) blue], one enters into the region of the CPD for less than an orbit [(2) orange], and one that ends up in the CPD [(3) red]. The solid lines represent forward integration from the initial conditions (black circles), while the dashed lines represent backward integration from the initial conditions. The coloured triangles show the location from which the chemical calculation is initialized. The host star is the black square. The x-axis corresponds to the radial distance along the axis passing through the host star and the embedded planet, centred here on the embedded planet. The y-axis runs perpendicular to the host star - planet axis and the z-axis extends from the midplane to heights above the disk. $x > 0$ corresponds to distance farther from the host star than the planet, while $y>0$ corresponds to the leading side of the planet's orbit.

**Figure 3. -** Temperature evolution for test streamlines. The first column shows the temperature as a function of time in orbits of the embedded planet. The second column shows the same temperature evolution of the streamlines as function of distance from the planet. The streamlines that enter the CPD first do so at around the same time ($\sim40$ orbits) because their forward integration is started just before they enter the CPD. In the second row the opacity of the line for $t>40$ orbits is reduced as a function of time to better differentiate separate orbits in the CPD. (*fig:temp*)
