**Abstract:** ${\color{blue} \bf NEW VERSION: We have a modified style file,     aaEC.cls, used here; with that, the bug reported in Sect. 8 no     longer occurs. In order to demonstrate this, the long author list     of \cite{EROData} was copied here.}$ \ This is a template file for the preparation of Euclid Consortium (EC) papersfor submission to A \& A. The list of lead authors and affiliations shouldbe prepared by the authors only on first submission to the ECEditorial Board (ECEB). Once thepaper is circulated within the full EC, and eligible authors can signup, then you should instead use the author and affiliation listgenerated for your paper on the Publication Portal; any editing ofthese lists byhand is error prone and must not be done.With the macros \textbackslash{\tt titlerunning} and \textbackslash{\tt authorrunning} ,shortened versions of the author list and the title should be given, suchthat they fit into the headline of each odd-numbered page.As a default, it is recommended to use the "traditional" abstract, asgiven in this example here. Nevertheless, the structure of theabstract should follow the journal's guidelines, i.e., context, aims,methods, and results, just without explicitly writing the headings.In the Appendix, we provide a list of EC publications, which will becontinuously updated. Furthermore, we have prepared the file ${\tt  Euclid.bib}$ , which contains most of the EC papers and can be usedfor preparing your reference list.
