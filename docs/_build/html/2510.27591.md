**Abstract:** $\object{$3$ Puppis}$ stands out as the brightest star known exhibiting the B [ e ] phenomenon. Although recent studies have classified this A-type star within the supergiant group, the influence of its binary nature on the circumstellar environment (CE) remains difficult to model and interpret. To resolve the dusty regions of $\object{$3$ Puppis}$ at angular scales of 5--10 milliarcseconds (mas), we conducted high-angular-resolution interferometric observations with the mid-infrared beam combiner VLTI/MATISSE across the $3$ -- $12 \mu$ m wavelength range. Since the $(u,v)$ coverage is sufficient to perform image reconstruction, we present an innovative statistical interferometric imaging technique based on the \texttt{MiRA} software to produce averaged images. Applied to MATISSE data, this systematic approach enables the selection of an optimal set of reconstructions, improving the robustness and fidelity of the recovered features. We also apply \texttt{SPARCO} , an independent imaging tool well suited to systems with a bright central source surrounded by a fainter and extended CE. The images obtained with both tools in the L, M, and N spectral bands show good agreement and clearly reveal an asymmetric elongated structure located at $\sim17$ mas ( $\sim10$ au at 631 pc) to the southeast of the image centre, with a density contrast of $\sim20\%$ . A second asymmetry to the northwest and a skewed inner rim are also detected. Simple geometric modelling, inspired by the reconstructed images, provides quantitative constraints on the morphology, position, and flux contribution of the CE and its asymmetries. Our final MATISSE images are consistent with previous VLTI interferometric observations while revealing a more complex CE with large-scale clumps in the southeast and northwest disc regions of $\object{$3$ Puppis}$ . Finally the hydrodynamic simulation concludes that the tidal spiral wake perturbations driven by the central binary, dynamically excited at Lindblad resonances within the circumbinary disc, provide the best interpretation for the radial extent and curvature of the elongated structures observed across all bands.

**Figure 11. -** Final image reconstructions of $3$ Puppis in the mid-infrared using \texttt{MiRA}, \texttt{MYTHRA}, and \texttt{SPARCO} imaging tools. The field of view for each image is (60 mas $\times$ 60 mas) with North up and East left. The blue dashed ellipse indicates the best-fit inner rim of the dusty disc derived from VLTI/AMBER data, while the blue cross marks the southeastern elongated clump best-fit position, denoted $R_\mathrm{ref}$, from MATISSE L-band geometric modelling (at a distance of $16.71 \pm 0.03$ mas from the image centre). Brightness colour scale is normalised to peak intensity (i.e. maximum pixel value). _K-band image:_ The left-most column shows the images obtained with VLTI/AMBER data by [Millour, Meilland and Chesneau (2011)](). In the first row the median \texttt{MiRA} image is displayed, and the last two rows present the identical convolved median \texttt{MiRA} image with the $\lambda/2B_\mathrm{max}$ PSF subtraction applied. _L-M-N-bands images:_ The remaining three columns display the images obtained with VLTI/MATISSE. On the first row the resulting \texttt{MYTHRA} averaged image is shown. The second row shows the convolved image of \texttt{MYTHRA} with the $\lambda/2B_\mathrm{max}$ PSF subtraction applied. The last row gives the resulting \texttt{SPARCO} image, convolved with the interferometric beam. (*fig:images*)

The legend in the lower-right corner indicates the colours corresponding to the four AT configurations used: Small (blue), Medium (orange), Large (green), and Extended (red). A schematic map of the VLTI baselines, using the same colour code, is shown in the upper-right corner. East corresponds to increasing $x$-axis values, and North to increasing $y$-axis values.

**Figure 9. -** VLTI/MATISSE squared visibility data, denoted V$^2$, in logarithmic scale (_top plot_) and closure phase data, denoted CP, (_bottom plot_) of $\object${$3$ Puppis} in the L- (blue), M- (green), and N- (red) bands, plotted as a function of spatial frequency B/$\lambda$. The vertical dashed lines indicate the approximate positions of the first visibility nulls in the three bands with the same colour code. The horizontal dashed line marks the visibility plateau at long baselines in the L-band, which reflects the relative flux contribution from the unresolved central source. (*fig:dataLMN*)
