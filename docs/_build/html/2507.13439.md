**Abstract:** Sub-Neptune exoplanets are the most abundant type of planet known today. As they do not have a Solar System counterpart, many open questions exist about their composition and formation.    Previous spectroscopic studies rule out aerosol-free hydrogen-helium-dominated atmospheres for many characterized sub-Neptunes but are inconclusive about their exact atmospheric compositions. Here we characterize the hot (T $_\mathrm{eq}$ =1311 K) sub-Neptune HD 86226 c (R=2.2 $ \si{\rearth}$ , M= $\SI{7.25}{\mearth}$ ), which orbits its G-type host star on a 4 day orbit. The planet is located in a special part of the sub-Neptune parameter space:    its high equilibrium temperature prohibits methane-based haze formation, increasing the chances for a clear atmosphere on this planet.    We use HST data taken with WFC3 and STIS from the Sub-neptune Planetary Atmosphere Characterization Experiment (SPACE) Program to perform near-infrared ( $1.1$ -- $1.7$ $\si{\micro\meter}$ ) transmission spectroscopy and ultraviolet characterization of the host star.    We report a featureless transmission spectrum that is consistent within $0.4 \sigma$ with a constant transit depth of $418\pm14$ ppm. The amplitude of this spectrum is only 0.01 scale heights for a H/He-dominated atmosphere, excluding a cloud-free solar-metallicity atmosphere on HD 86226 c with a confidence of $6.5 \sigma$ .    Based on an atmospheric retrieval analysis and forward models of cloud and haze formation, we find that the featureless spectrum could be due to a metal enrichment $[\mathrm{M}/\mathrm{H}]>2.3$ ( $3 \sigma$ confidence lower limit) of a cloudless atmosphere, or alternatively silicate ($MgSiO_3$ ), iron (Fe), or manganese sulfide (MnS) clouds. For these species, we perform a detailed investigation of cloud formation in high metallicity, high-temperature atmospheres. Our results highlight that HD 86226 c does not follow the aerosol trend of sub-Neptunes found by previous studies. Follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope could determine whether this planet aligns with the recent detections of metal-enriched atmospheres or if it harbors a cloud species otherwise atypical for sub-Neptunes.

**Figure 12. -**  Comparison between different grid models and the goodness of fit for the MnS (top row), $MgSiO_3$(middle row), and Fe (bottom row) clouds calculated at the planetary radius set to 2.313 $\si{\rearth}$. For each species, the left panel shows our observations with uncertainties compared against some selected lowest reduced chi-squared ($\chi^2_\nu$) models, with the corresponding $\chi^2_\nu$ values in the bottom legend. The parameter values for clear, no-cloud models are given in the left legend, and for cloudy models, they are given in the right legend. The flat model is drawn as a dotted line at a transit depth of 418 ppm. The tables in the middle and right panels display the models' $\chi^2_\nu$ values on a grid of cloud droplet radius $r_g$, droplet volume mixing ratio $q^*$, and metallicity [M/H]. The table titles list fixed parameters. The color bar extent is set between 1 and 2 to highlight only the models that best fit the data.  (*fig:JB_MnS_MgSiO3_Fe*)

**Figure 1. -** SPACE targetsSub-Neptune targets of the SPACE program. $\HD$ is shown with a green square marker, and the other SPACE targets are shown in purple. Top: Temperature-radius plane. Gray circles show the known population of planets with radii between $\SI{1.8}{\rearth}$ and $\SI{4}{\rearth}$ based on the entries of the NASA Exoplanet Archive$\footnote$mark in May 2024. Black crosses mark JWST Cycle 1-4 targets, except for the SPACE targets TOI-431d and $\HD$, which will be observed in Cycle 4. Bottom: Mass-radius plane. Color curves show models from [Zeng, Jacobsen and Sasselov (2019)]() for various planetary compositions and temperatures. (*fig:intro:SPACE*)

**Figure 11. -** Cloud scattering and absorption coefficients of MnS, $MgSiO_3$, and Fe condensates. All species are featureless on the narrow wavelength range of our observations, 1.1 -- 1.7 $\si{\micro\meter}$(marked with blue vertical lines), for the expected sizes of the cloud droplets of 0.01 -- 100 $\si{\micro\meter}$. As shown, this is not the case for MnS and $MgSiO_3$ clouds in the range of 0.2 -- 15 $\si{\micro\meter}$, where their effect on the spectra should be distinguishable, providing high-resolution observations. Note that values are plotted in log-log space to highlight the narrow wavelength range of our observations. (*fig:JB_Mieff_coeffs*)
