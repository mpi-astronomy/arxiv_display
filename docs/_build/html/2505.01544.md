**Abstract:** ${Ultra-hot Jupiters are gas giant exoplanets strongly irradiated by their star, which sets intense molecular dissociation leading to atmospheric chemistry}$ dominated by ions and atoms. These conditions inhibit ${day-to-night}$ heat redistribution resulting in ${large}$ temperature contrast. Phase-curve observations ${over several}$ passbands offer insights on the thermal structure and properties of these extreme atmospheres. We aim to perform a joint analysis of ${multiple}$ observations of $\planet$ from the visible to the mid-infrared, using unpublished data from $\cheops$ , $\tess$ and $\spitzer$ . Our purpose is to characterise the ${planetary atmosphere}$ with a consistent view over the large wavelength range covered, including $\jwst{data}$ . We implement a model for the planetary signal including transits, occultations, phase signal, ellipsoidal variations, Doppler boosting, and light-travel time. We fit jointly more than 250 ${{eclipse events} and derive atmospheric properties}$ using General Circulation Models and retrieval ${analyses}$ . ${We obtain}$ new ephemerides with unprecedented precisions of 1 second and 1.4 millisecond on the time of inferior conjunction and orbital period, respectively. We ${compute}$ a planetary radius of $R_p=1.1926\pm0.0077 R_J$ with a precision of 0.65 \% , or 550 km. Through a timing inconsistency with $\jwst$ , we ${discuss and confirm orbital eccentricity ($e=0.00852\pm0.00091$),}$ and constrain the argument of periastron to ${$\omega=261.9^{+1.3}_{-1.4} \deg$}$ . We show that the large dayside emission implies the presence of magnetic drag and super-solar metallicity. We ${find a steep thermally-inverted gradient in the planetary atmosphere, which is common for ultra-hot Jupiters}$ . ${We detect the presence of strong CO emission lines at 4.5 \textmu m from an excess of dayside brightness in the \spitzer /IRAC/Channel 2 passband. {Using these models to} constrain the reflected contribution in the \cheops  passband{, we derive an extremely low geometric albedo} $A_g^\text{\cheops }={0.027}\pm{0.011}$.}$ The orbital eccentricity remains a potential challenge for planetary dynamics that might require further study given the short-period massive planet and despite the young age of the system. The characterisation of the atmosphere of $\planet$ reveals the necessity to account for magnetic friction and super-solar metallicity to explain the full picture of the dayside emission. ${We find the planetary dayside to be extremely unreflective, but when juxtaposing \tess  and \cheops  data, we get hints of increased scattering efficiency in the visible, likely due to Rayleigh scattering.}$

**Figure 7. -** Estimated geometric albedo of $\planet$  based on the retrieval results in comparison to the passbands of $\cheops$  and $\tess$ . {The green line shows the geometric albedo with an \ch{H-} abundance derived by assuming chemical equilibrium {(extremely low $A_g$ values, reaching 0.03 at short wavelengths)}. For the purple line, this abundance is artificially reduced by 98\% {(yielding $A_g$ values comparable to our results in the $\cheops$  and $\tess$  passbands)}, while for the yellow case the \ch{H-} continuum is entirely removed as an opacity source. {We further explored the effect of removing} TiO and VO (red) as well as {Na and K} (blue).}{The impact of the former is negligible and the red curve lies hidden behind the yellow model. The latter reveals however more significant scattering spectral features, especially in the $\cheops$  and $\tess$  passbands.} The strong increase of $A_g$ towards lower wavelengths is caused by the $\lambda^{-4}$-dependence of Rayleigh scattering.

**Figure 14. -** Occultation depths as a function of wavelength. The black points with errorbars represent the measurement from this work ($\cheops$ , $\tess$  and $\spitzer$  -- 2 leftmost and 4 rightmost points) and from \cite{Coulombe2023} with $\jwst$(0.8--3 $\um$). The GCM simulations {including TiO and VO}(Section \ref{ssec:gcm}) with and without magnetic drag are shown in orange and light brown, respectively.
                        {The orange-filled diamonds mark the passband-integrated GCM values with magnetic drag ($\tau_\text{fric}=10^4 \text{s}$).}
                        The retrieval runs (Section \ref{ssec:retrieval}) are shown in {blue, pink, purple and green}(same colours as in Fig. \ref{fig:bright_temp} and Table \ref{table:retrievals}) depending on the data points included in the fit.
                        {An inset zoomed-in view of the $\cheops$ -to-1.75 $\um$  range is shown in the lower right corner for convenience.} (*fig:docc_wl*)

**Figure 2. -** Correlation plot of the posterior distribution of the eccentricity $e$ and argument of periastron $\omega$ of the orbit of $\planet$  that match the mid-occultation time $T_\text{occ}^\text{JWST}$ from \cite{Coulombe2023}. We used our posterior distribution on planetary parameters from Table \ref{tab:parameters}, and Gaussian priors on $e \cos\omega$ and $e \sin\omega${from \cite{Triaud2010_HJs} in blue, \cite{Nymeyer2011_WASP-18b} in orange, and \cite{Csizmadia2019_WASP-18b} in green. Overall, the 3 posterior distributions are all consistent with each other within $<1.2 \sigma$.}
