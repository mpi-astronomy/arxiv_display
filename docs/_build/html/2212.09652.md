    _Right column (c, f, i):_ Ratio maps in logarithmic scale for $\Remark{R21} = $\Remark${ICO21}/$\Remark${ICO10}$, $\Remark{R42} = $\Remark${ICO43}/$\Remark${ICO21}$ and $\Remark{RCICO} = $\Remark${ICI10}/$\Remark${ICO21}$ at the common resolution of $3.5"$(beam is shown in bottom left).
    Same contours of $\Remark{ICO21}$ at 400, 1000, 1500, 2000 and 3000 $\Remark{Kkms}$ are shown in all panels.
    Four regions mentioned in this work are highlighted in panel _a)_.
    The cone in panel _d)_ represents the known
    ionized gas outflow with a half-opening angle $50^\circ$, cone axis inclination $35^{\circ}$ and PA $126^{\circ}$( ([Hjelm and Lindblad 1996]()) ; see also  ([Sandqvist, Joersaeter and Lindblad 1995](), [ and Lindblad 1999](), [Venturi, Nardini and Marconi 2018](), [Gao, Egusa and Liu 2021]()) ) and the white line indicates the disk kinematic major axis at PA $220^\circ$( ([ and Jorsater 1995](), [ and Lindblad 1999]()) ).

    _a)_
    CO(1--0) line-integrated intensity,
    _b)_ velocity dispersion,
    _c)_$\Remark${R21} line ratio,
    _d)_ 2 $\um$,
    _e)_ 11.3 $\um$, and
    _f)_ 21 $\um$ emission.
    Dashed lines are the best-fit trends and legends show the Spearman rank correlation coefficients, which are also reported in Table \ref{tab:1}.
    Each inset upper panel shows the rms distribution of the data after subtracting the best-fit trend in bins of the horizontal-axis variable.
