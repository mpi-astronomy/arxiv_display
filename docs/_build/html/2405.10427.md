**Abstract:** ${Accretion bursts from low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) are knownformany decades. In recent years, the first accretion bursts of massive YSOs (MYSOs) were observed.These phases of intense protostellar growth are of particular importance for studying massive star formation. Bursts of MYSOs are accompanied by flares of Class II methanol masers (hereafter masers), caused by an increase in exciting mid-infrared (MIR) emission.They can lead to long-lasting thermal afterglows of the dust continuum radiation visible at infrared (IR) and (sub)mm wavelengths. Furthermore, they might cause a scattered light echo.The G323.46$-$0.08 (hereafter G323) event, which shows all these features, extendsthe small sample of known MYSO bursts.   }$ ${Maser observations of the MYSO G323show evidence of a flare, which was presumed to be caused by an accretion burst. This should be verified with IR data.We used time-dependent radiative transfer (TDRT) to characterize the heating and cooling timescales for eruptive MYSOs and to infer the main burst parameters.   }$ ${Burst light curves, as well as the pre-burst spectral energy distribution (SED) wereestablished from archival IR data.The properties of the MYSO, including its circumstellar disk and envelope, were derived by using static radiative transfer modeling of pre-burst data. For the first time, TDRT was used to predict the temporal evolution of the SED. Observations with SOFIA/HAWC+ were performedto constrain the burst energy from the strength of the thermal afterglow. Image subtraction and ratioing was applied to reveal the light echo.   }$ ${The G323 accretion burst is confirmed. It reached its peak in late 2013/early 2014 with a $K_{\rm s}$-band increase of ${\sim}${\ts}2.5{\ts}mag.Both $K_{\rm s}$-band and integrated maser flux densities follow an exponential decay.TDRT indicates that the duration of the thermal afterglow in the far-infrared (FIR) can exceed the burst duration by years.The latter was proved by SOFIA observations, which indicate a flux increase of $(14.2\pm4.6)$\% at $70  \rm \mu m$ and $(8.5\pm6.1)$\% at $160{\ts}\mu$m in 2022 (2 years after the burst end).A one-sided light echo emerged that was propagating into the interstellar medium.}$ ${The burst origin of the G323 maser flare is verified.TDRT simulationsrevealed the strong influence of the burst energetics and the localdust distribution on the strength and duration of the afterglow.The G323 burst is probably the most energetic MYSO burst observed so far. Within $8.4 \rm   yrs$, an energy of $(0.9\mypm_{0.8}^{2.5}) \times 10^{47} \rm erg$ was released. The short timescale points tothe accretion of a compact body, while the burst energy corresponds to an accumulated mass of at least$(7\mypm_{6}^{20}) M_{Jup}$and possibly even more if the protostar is bloated.In this case, the accretion event might have triggered protostellar pulsations, which give rise to the observed maser periodicity.The associated IR light echo is the second observed from a MYSO burst.}$

**Figure 20. -** The $K_{\rm s}$-band difference images show the temporal evolution of the burst and the associated LEs, displayed using a log-scale. The prompt echo, which originates from the cloud core, is monopolar and spreads to the south-east at an PA of $\sim$ 135â—¦. A remote LE that appeared later traces denser structures of the ISM. The red polygon encloses the area from which its light curves were established. The FoV is $135$\arcsec$\times80$\arcsec$.$ (*fig:seq*)

	Light curves based on VVV(X) (black) and (NEO)WISE photometry (W1 - blue, $W2$ - red) as well as 6.7{$\ts$}GHz total maser flux (green, \citealp{greenExcitedstateHydroxylMaser2015, MacLeod:2021}). Vertical
 red and blue lines mark the dates of the
 the burst onset and first flare evidence
	from the
	6.035{$\ts$}GHz exOH maser
 \citep{MacLeod:2021}.
    The $K_{\rm s}$ rise was approximated by
    a polynomial,
    while its decay is roughly linear on a log-scale (dashed line).
    The (NEO)WISE magnitudes are shifted
    to match those of $K_{\rm s}$. The
    integrated maser flux is shown on a log-scale (right ordinate).
    Its scatter is due to the short-term periodicity.
    Right: $K_{\rm s}$(black), $i$(blue), and $z$(green) light curves, with $i$ and $z$ magnitudes shifted
    to match those of $K_{\rm s}$.
    The $z$ pre- and post-magnitudes agree within the errors.
