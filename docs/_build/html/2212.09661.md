$We present new neutral atomic carbon [C~\textsc{i}]~( ^3P_1~\to~ ^3P_0) mapping observations within the inner \sim 7~kpc and \sim 4~kpc of the disks of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321 at a spatial resolution of 190~pc and 270~pc, respectively, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) Atacama Compact Array (ACA).$
$We combine these with the CO(2--1) data from PHANGS-ALMA, and literature [C~\textsc{i}] and CO data for two other starburst and/or active galactic nucleus (AGN) galaxies (NGC~1808, NGC~7469), to study: \textit{a)} the spatial distributions of C~\textsc{i} and CO emission; \textit{b)} the observed line ratio \RCICO = I_{\mathrm{[C{\normalfont\textsc{i}}]}(1\textnormal{--}0)} / I_{\mathrm{CO}(2\textnormal{--}1)} as a function of various galactic properties; and \textit{c)} the abundance ratio of [C~\textsc{i}/CO].$
$We find excellent spatial correspondence between C~\textsc{i} and CO emission and nearly uniform \RCICO \sim 0.1 across the majority of the star-forming disks of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321.$
$However, \RCICO strongly varies from \sim 0.05 at the centre of NGC~4321 to > 0.2 \text{--} 0.5 in NGC~1808's starbursting centre and NGC~7469's centre with an X-ray-luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN).$
$Meanwhile, \RCICOdoes not obviously vary with \Umean, similar to the prediction of photodissociation dominated region (PDR) models.$
$We also find a mildly decreasing \RCICOwith an increasing metallicity over 0.7\text{--}0.85 \mathrm{Z_{\odot}}, consistent with the literature.$
$Assuming various typical ISM conditions representing giant molecular clouds, active star-forming regions and strong starbursting environments, we calculate the local-thermodynamic-equilibrium radiative transfer and estimate the [C~\textsc{i}/CO] abundance ratio to be \sim 0.1 across the disks of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321, similar to previous large-scale findings in Galactic studies.$
$However, this abundance ratio likely has a substantial increase to \sim 1 and \gtrsim 1--5 in NGC~1808's starburst and NGC~7469's strong AGN environments, respectively, in line with the expectations for cosmic-ray dominated region (CRDR) and X-ray dominated region (XDR) chemistry.$
$Finally, we do not find a robust evidence for a generally CO-dark, C~\textsc{i}-bright gas in the disk areas we probed.$

$\section{Introduction}$
$\label{subsec: intro RCICO}$
$\subsection{Neutral atomic carbon in the interstellar medium}$
$Neutral atomic carbon (C^0 or \neutralcarbon) is an important phase of carbon in the interstellar medium (ISM) besides ionized carbon (C^+ or \ionizedcarbon) and carbon monoxide (CO).$
$Its ^{3}P state is split into three fine-structure levels. The^{3}P_{1} \to  ^{3}P_{0} transition line at 492.16065~GHz,$
$hereafter \Remark{CI10}$
$, has an upper energy level of E_u = 23.620~K and a critical density of n_{\mathrm{crit}} \sim 1.0 \times 10^{3} \;\mathrm{cm^{-3}} (at a temperature of 50~K) \footnote{n_{\mathrm{crit}} \equiv A / \gamma, where A is the Einstein A coefficient for the transition and \gamma the rate of collisional de-excitation with hydrogen molecules, with values from \cite{Schroder1991} as compiled in the Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database (\citealt{Schoier2005}), \url{https://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~moldata/}},$
$and the^{3}P_{2} \to  ^{3}P_{1} transition line at 809.34197~GHz has E_u = 62.462~K and n_{\mathrm{crit}} \sim 3.4 \times 10^{3} \;\mathrm{cm^{-3}}.$
$Therefore, they are easily excited in the cold ISM environment.$
$Given the high abundance of carbon in the ISM, \neutralcarbon, CO and \ionizedcarbon  are the most powerful cold ISM tracers, and are the most widely used tools to probe cold ISM properties and hence galaxy evolution at cosmological distances.$
$The interstellar \neutralcarbon  is produced from$
$the photodissociation of CO molecules by UV photons and the recombination of \ionizedcarbon , both happening in photodissociation regions (PDRs; \citealt{Langer1976,deJong1980,Tielens1985a,Tielens1985b,vanDishoeck1986,vanDishoeck1988,Sternberg1989,Sternberg1995,Hollenbach1991,Hollenbach1999,Kaufman1999,Wolfire2010,Madden2020,Bisbas2021}, also see reviews by \citealt{Genzel1989,Jaffe1985,Hollenbach1997,Wolfire2022}).$
$In the simple plane-parallel (i.e., 1-D) PDR model, \neutralcarbon  exists in a layer where UV photons can penetrate through the molecular gas but cannot maintain a high carbon ionizing rate.$
$Such a layer is suggested to have an intermediate gas surface density (N_{\mathrm{H_2}} \sim 1 \textnormal{--} 4 \times 10^{20} \;\mathrm{cm^{-2}}), fairly cold temperature (10 to a few tens K), and moderate visual extinction (A_V \sim 1 - 4).$
$CO molecules dominate the more shielded interior of this layer and \ionizedcarbon  dominates the exterior.$
$Hydrogen molecules are gradually photodissociated to atoms across this layer (A_V \sim 0.1 - 4).$
$This plane-parallel scenario qualitatively explains the layered structure of the Orion Bar PDR in our Galaxy on sub-pc scales (e.g.,  \citealt{Genzel1989,Tielens1993,Tauber1994,Hogerheijde1995b,Hollenbach1999,Goicoechea2016}), and the \rho~Ophiuchi~A PDR in a recent study with an unprecedented resolution of 360~AU (\citealt{Yamagishi2021}), where the interplay between individual young, massive (O, B) stars and the ISM can be directly observed.$
$However, such simple models cannot fully explain molecular clouds. Plenty of observations in Galactic molecular clouds, \ionizedhydrogen  regions and star-formation complexes have revealed a widespread \neutralcarbon  distribution over most areas of molecular clouds on scales of a few to ten pc, and a relatively high \neutralcarbon  fractional abundance even at a large A_V depth > 10~mag (\citealt{Phillips1980,Phillips1981,Wootten1982,Keene1985,Keene1987,Jaffe1985,Zmuidzinas1986,Zmuidzinas1988,Genzel1988,Frerking1989,Plume1994,Plume1999,Gerin1998a,Tatematsu1999,Ikeda1999,Ikeda2002,Yamamoto2001,Zhang2001,Kamegai2003,Oka2004,Izumi2021}).$
$This observational evidence actually requires PDRs to be clumpy  (\citealt{Stutzki1988,Genzel1988,Burton1990,Meixner1993,Spaans1997,Kramer2004,Kramer2008,Pineda2008,Sun2008}), with a volume filling factor much less than unity (e.g., \sim 0.1 - 0.3; \citealt{Stutzki1988}), so that$
$UV photons can penetrate through most of the cloud, except for the densest clumps.$
$Therefore, the spatial co-existence of \neutralcarbon  and low rotational transition (low-J) CO lines can be well explained by such an inter-clump medium inside the molecular clouds.$
$Alternatively, cosmic rays (CRs) have also been proposed to be the reason for the \neutralcarbon -CO association as they can penetrate much deeper than UV photons into clouds, and thus more uniformly dissociate CO molecules into \neutralcarbon  inside clouds (\citealt{Field1969,Padovani2009,Papadopoulos2010c,Ivlev2015,Papadopoulos2018}).$
$\subsection{Variations of the \CI/\CO line ratio (\RCICO) in the literature}$
$Although the spatial distributions of \CI  and low-J CO emission resemble each other surprisingly well from molecular clouds to Galactic scales (e.g., across the Galactic plane; \citealt{Wright1991,Bennett1994,Oka2005,Burton2015}) and in external galaxies with spatially resolved observations (e.g., \citealt{Schilke1993,White1994b,Harrison1995,Israel1995,Israel2001,Israel2003,Zhang2014,Krips2016,Cicone2018,Crocker2019,Jiao2019,Miyamoto2018,Miyamoto2021,Salak2019,Izumi2020,Saito2020,Michiyama2020,Michiyama2021}),$
$their line intensity ratio, \Remark{RCI10CO10} = \Remark{ICI10} / \Remark{ICO10} \footnote{The line intensity I has brightness temperature units \mathrm{K km s^{-1}}.}, does vary according to local ISM conditions --- \CI  and CO fractional abundance (i.e., metallicity), excitation condition (e.g., excitation temperature T_{\mathrm{ex}} and optical depth \tau), and UV and/or CR radiation field.$
$At individual molecular cloud scales, \Remark{RCI10CO10} (or column density ratio) seems to vary from \gtrsim 0.5 (or \gtrsim 0.2 for column density ratio) to <0.1 with an increasing N_{\mathrm{H2}} and A_V, e.g., from cloud surface or PDR front to the interior \citep[e.g.][]{Frerking1982,Genzel1988,Oka2004,Kramer2004,Kramer2008,Mookerjea2006,Sun2008,Yamagishi2021}.$
$At sub-galactic scales, when individual clouds are smoothed out, \Remark{RCI10CO10} is found to lie in a narrower range of \sim 0.1 \text{--} 0.3. For example, across the Galactic plane, the ratio is found to change only slightly within a galactocentric radius of 3--7~kpc (\sim 0.08 \text{--} 0.12, overall mean = 0.105 \pm 0.004; \citealt{Oka2005});$
$whereas in the starburst galaxies like M~82 and NGC~253, \Remark{RCI10CO10} or the [\CI]/CO abundance ratio is a factor of 3--5 higher than the Galactic value (\citealt{Schilke1993,White1994b,Krips2016}).$
$Recent high-resolution (hundred pc scales) \Remark{CI10} mapping studies in the nearby spiral galaxy M~83 (\citealt{Miyamoto2021}) and starburst galaxy IRAS~F18293-3413 (\citealt{Saito2020}) reported tightly-correlated \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO10} emission, with scaling relations at hundred parsecs equivalent to$
$\Remark{RCI10CO10} = 0.14 \times (L^{\prime}_{\Remark{CO10}}/10^{6.0} [\Remark{Kkmspc2}])^{-0.13}$
$and$
$\Remark{RCI10CO10} = 0.21 \times (L^{\prime}_{\Remark{CO10}}/10^{6.8} [\Remark{Kkmspc2}])^{+0.54},$
$respectively.$
$The discrepant power-law indices reflects different trends in individual galaxies that are not fully understood.$
$Meanwhile, in the central \lesssim 100~pc of NGC~7469 close to the X-ray-luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN), \RCICO  is found to be substantially enhanced by a factor of >10 (reaching \Remark{RCI10CO10} \approx 1; \citealt{Izumi2020}; see also the Circinus Galaxy's AGN with \Remark{RCI10CO32} \approx 0.9 in \citealt{Izumi2018}).$
$Furthermore, in the low-metallicity Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) environments, a factor of 1.5 - 3 \times higher \RCICO  values have been found (\citealt{Bolatto2000b,Bolatto2000c}; see also other low-metallicity galaxies: \citealt{Bolatto2000a,Hunt2017}).$
$These studies indicate that \RCICO  is sensitive to ISM conditions among and within galaxies.$
$However, previous extragalactic studies are mainly focused on starburst galaxies and bright galaxy centres. How \RCICO  behaves across the disks and spiral arms of typical star-forming galaxies is much less explored. Whether \CI  can trace the so-called CO-dark molecular gas at a low gas density or metallicity is also still in question.$
$Understanding \RCICO  variation and quantifying the \CI  and \CO  excitation in extragalactic environments is now particularly important given the rapidly growing numbers and diverse galactic environments of \CI  line observations at cosmological distances (e.g., \citealt{Weiss2003,Weiss2005,Pety2004,Wagg2006,Walter2011,Danielson2011,AlaghbandZadeh2013,Gullberg2016,Bothwell2017,Popping2017,Yang2017,Emonts2018,Valentino2018,Valentino2020,Bourne2019,Nesvadba2019,Dannerbauer2019,Jin2019,Brisbin2019,Boogaard2020,Cortzen2020,Harrington2021,Dunne2021,Lee2021}).$
$\subsection{What drives \RCICO? --- the need for high-resolution mapping across wide galactic environments}$
$High-resolution mapping of \CI  and CO from disks and spiral arms of nearby galaxies is indispensable for understanding and quantifying the ISM \CI  and CO physics. In particular, the following questions will be answered only with such observations:$
$Do \CI  and low-J CO have the same spatial distributions across galaxy disks?$
$Does the \RCICO  line ratio vary significantly across galaxy disks?$
$How does the \RCICO  line ratio vary among different local galaxies?$
$How can the observed \RCICO  line ratio be reliably converted to the \CI  and CO column density ratio (i.e., solving their radiation transfer equations and level population statistics and obtaining optical depths and excitation temperature)?$
$Currently, high-resolution (hundreds of parsec scale) imaging/mapping of \CI  in nearby galaxies relies on radio telescopes at high altitudes, e.g., the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE, 10-m single-dish), Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX, 12-m single-dish), and is limited to the available weather conditions corresponding to the high frequency of \CI  lines. Therefore, only a handful of galaxies have been imaged/mapped.$
$These include NGC~6240 by \citet{Cicone2018}, Circinus Galaxy by \citet{Izumi2018}, NGC~613 by \citet{Miyamoto2018}, NGC~1808 by \citet{Salak2019}, NGC~7469 by \citet{Izumi2020}, IRAS~F18293-3413 by \citet{Saito2020}, NGC~6052 by \citet[][\CI  undetected]{Michiyama2020}, 36 (U)LIRGs by \citet{Michiyama2021}, M~83 by \citet[][mapped the centre and northern part with ASTE]{Miyamoto2021}, Arp~220 by \citet{Ueda2022}, and NGC~1068 by \citet{Saito2022a,Saito2022b}.$
$Nevertheless, all of these observations, except for M~83, targeted the centres of starburst, IR-luminous and/or AGN host galaxies. M~83 is the only typical star-forming main sequence galaxy having a high-quality \CI  mapping. However, its map is still limited to a quarter of its inner \sim3~kpc disk.$
$In this work, we present two new \CI  mapping observations with the ALMA Atacama Compact Array (or Morita Array; 7-m dish, hereafter ACA or 7m) in nearby spiral galaxies NGC~3627 and NGC~4321.$
$Our observations aimed at detecting \CI  in the disks, and thus are much larger-area and deeper than previous \CI  maps.$
$By further adding a starburst and an AGN-host galaxy from the literature into our analysis, we present a comprehensive study of the \Remark{RCI10CO21} line ratio (hereafter \RCICO; ratios of other \CI /CO transitions will be explicitly written otherwise) in nearby star-forming disk and starburst and AGN environments.$
$In order to quantify the \CI  and CO abundance ratio,$
$we have further calculated the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE radiative transfer of \CI  and CO under several \textit{representative ISM conditions}.$
$The results from this study could thus be one of the most comprehensive local benchmarks for understanding the \CI  and CO line ratio and abundance variations.$
$The paper, as the first one of our series of papers, is organized as follows.$
$Sect.~\ref{sec: Observations} describes the sample selection, observations and data reduction.$
$Sect.~\ref{sec: Results} presents the spatial distribution and variation of \RCICO.$
$Sect.~\ref{sec: Excitation Analysis} presents the analysis of \CI  and CO excitation and radiative transfer and thus the abundance (species column density) ratio.$
$In Sect.~\ref{sec: Discussion} we discuss various topics relating to the [\CI/CO] abundance variation, CRDR, XDR, and CO-dark gas.$
$Finally we conclude in Sect.~\ref{sec: Conclusion}.$
$Our companion paper~II (D. Liu et al. in prep.) presents the detailed radiative transfer calculation and \CI  and CO conversion factors, and is related to the abundance calculation in this paper.$

$\section{Targets and observations}$
$\label{sec: Observations}$
$\subsection{Target selection}$
$\label{subsection: Target Selection}$
$Our targets, NGC~3627 and NGC~4321, are selected from a joint sample of the PHANGS-ALMA CO(2--1) (\citealt{Leroy2021phangs}), PHANGS-HST (\citealt{PHANGSHST}), and PHANGS-MUSE (\citealt{PHANGSMUSE}) surveys, with CO line intensities and systemic velocities best suitable for ALMA Band 8 \CI  mapping.$
$The PHANGS-ALMA sample consists of 90 nearby star-forming galaxies initially selected at distances of 2 \lesssim d / \mathrm{Mpc} \lesssim 23, with a stellar mass \log (M_{\star}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}) > 9.75, and which are not too inclined and visible to ALMA. They represent the typical star-forming main sequence galaxies in the local Universe.$
$The PHANGS-HST sample \citep{PHANGSHST} is a subsample of 38 PHANGS-ALMA galaxies, providing high-resolution stellar properties.$
$The PHANGS-MUSE large program \citep{PHANGSMUSE} targeted a subsample of 19 PHANGS-ALMA galaxies suitable for VLT/MUSE optical integral field unit (IFU) observations, achieving similar spatial coverage as in PHANGS-ALMA and providing rich nebular emission lines, attenuation, stellar age and metallicity and H~\textsc{ii} region information (e.g., \citealt{Kreckel2019, Kreckel2020, Pessa2021, Santoro2021, Williams2022}).$
$For the legacy value, we selected our sample from the joint ALMA+MUSE+HST sample pool, considered CO surface brightness, mapping area, \CI  line frequency and the transmission in the ALMA Band 8.$
$In this work, we present the new \CI  data of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321.$
$Because of the ALMA Band 8 sensitivity and the expected fainter \CI  line intensity than CO, the \CI  mapping areas are smaller than their CO(2--1) maps, but they are still the largest (\sim1'-2.35') and deepest (rms~\sim0.04~K per \sim5~km~s^{-1}) \CI  mapping with ALMA.$
$Furthermore, in order to study the \CI  and CO in different galactic environments, we selected two starbursting and/or AGN-host galaxies from the literature whose ALMA \Remark{CI10} and CO(2--1) data are available in the archive: NGC~1808 \citep{Salak2019} and NGC~7469 \citep{Izumi2020}.$
$NGC~1808 has ALMA mosaic observations covering its \sim 1~kpc starburst ring, and NGC~7469 has ALMA single-pointing observations covering its inner \sim 3~kpc area.$
$\subsection{New ALMA ACA Band 8 observations}$
$\label{subsection: ALMA Band 8 Observation}$
$Our \CI  observations for NGC~3627 were taken under the ALMA project 2018.1.01290.S (PI: D. Liu) during June 3rd to Sept. 29th, 2019 with ACA-only at Band~8. The total on-source integration time was 30.8~hours. A mosaic with 149 pointings was used to map an area of 94" \times 136" at a position angle of -27^\circ, which covers the galaxy centre, bar and the majority of the spiral arms, and is about 1/3 of the full PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) map area.$
$The achieved line sensitivity per 5 \kms is 45--55~mK (107--130~\mathrm{mJy/beam}) across the \Remark{CI10} line frequencies with a beam of 3.46".$
$The \CI  mapping for NGC~4321 were taken under the ALMA project 2019.1.01635.S (PI: D. Liu; NGC~1365 is also partially observed for this project) during Dec. 3rd, 2019 to July 1st, 2021, also with ACA-only at Band~8. The on-source integration time reached 16.1~hours for the mapping of an area of 55" \times 42" with 23 pointings using the 7m array. The achieved line sensitivity is similar to that of NGC~3627.$
$More detailed information is newd in Table~\ref{table: targets}.$
$ACA (7m) was chosen to new a matched and slightly coarser synthesized beam (\sim 3"-4") than the PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) data. In comparison, the main 12m ALMA array in compact C43-1/2 configurations will result in a \sim 0.4"-0.7" beam and significantly miss large scale (>4-6") emission without ACA.$
$No total power observations were requested in our presented observation, therefore we matched the uv ranges of the raw CO(2--1) and \Remark{CI10} visibility data during our data reduction.$
$We verified that missing flux will not substantially (\sim 30\%) bias our analysis using three methods as detailed in Appendix~\ref{appendix: missing flux}. This includes a CASA simulation of visibilities mimicking our ACA mosaic observations in NGC~3627, from which we find a missing flux as small as 7\% in \CI-bright pixels and up to \sim 50\% in the faintest pixels (and mostly < 30\%).$
$Our data reduction follows the PHANGS-ALMA imaging and post-processing pipeline \citep[][]{Leroy2021pipeline}, including imaging and deconvolution, mosaicking, broad and strict/signal mask generation, and moment map creation.$
$The additional steps in this study are: (a) uv-clipping in the CO(2--1) data to match the uv sampling range of \Remark{CI10}; and (b) making a joint mask of the individual CO(2--1) and \Remark{CI10} masks then extracting the moment maps (in the joint broad mask) and line ratios maps (in the joint strict mask).$
$More technical details are newd in Appendix~\ref{appendix: data reduction}.$
$Our \Remark{CI10} and CO(2--1) line intensity maps, the line ratio maps and \textit{HST} images for the two PHANGS galaxies, NGC~3627 and NGC~4321, are presented in Figs.~\ref{fig: NGC3627 line ratio map} and \ref{fig: NGC4321 line ratio map}, respectively.$
$Our data cubes and moment maps are also made publicly available at$
$the PHANGS-ALMA CADC public repository \footnote{\url{https://www.canfar.net/storage/list/phangs/RELEASES/DZLIU_etal_2022}}.$

$\label{subsection: additional targets}$
$The NGC~1808 ALMA \Remark{CI10}, \Remark{CO10} and \Remark{CO21} observations are presented in \citet{Salak2019} and all are interferometry plus total power, i.e., 12m+7m+tp, thus having no missing flux issue.$
$To study the \CI /\CO  line ratio consistently with our main targets, we only used the \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO21} data.$
$We re-reduced the raw data under ALMA project 2017.1.00984.S (PI: D. Salak) with the observatory calibration pipeline, then imaged, primary-beam-corrected and short-spacing-corrected using the PHANGS-ALMA pipeline in the same way as for our main targets (Appendix~\ref{appendix: data reduction}).$
$Note that in this step we re-reduced and imaged the total power data with the PHANGS-ALMA singledish pipeline (\citealt{Herrera2020,Leroy2021pipeline}) and did the short-spacing correction with the PHANGS-ALMA pipeline right after the primary beam correction.$
$The properties of the final \CO -\CI  beam-matched data cubes are listed in Table~\ref{table: targets}.$
$The NGC~7469 ALMA data are presented in \citet{Izumi2020} and we used the archival raw data of \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO21} under ALMA project 2017.1.00078.S (PI: T. Izumi). These are single pointings toward the centre. \Remark{CI10} is observed with ACA 7m and \Remark{CO21} with the 12m array, both without total power. We re-reduced the data following the same procedure as for NGC~3627 and NGC~4321 with the PHANGS-ALMA pipeline.$
$Our re-reduced \Remark{CI10} and CO(2--1) line intensity and ratio maps for these additional galaxies are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig: other line ratio maps}.$

$\subsection{Spatial distributions}$
$In Figs.~\ref{fig: NGC3627 line ratio map}, \ref{fig: NGC4321 line ratio map} and \ref{fig: other line ratio maps}, we present the beam-matched \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO21} integrated line intensity maps and their ratio maps.$
$The \CI/\CO  line ratio map is computed only for pixels within the joint strict mask area of the two lines, as described in Appendix~\ref{appendix: data reduction}, representing high-confidence signals.$
$In NGC~3627 (Fig.~\ref{fig: NGC3627 line ratio map}), we visually marked 23 regions based on the \CI  and CO commonly-detected (\mathrm{S/N}>3), strict-mask areas for later analysis. Region IDs are sorted by their \Remark{CI10} brightness.$
$Region 1 corresponds to the galaxy centre, Regions 2 and 3 are the southern and northern bar ends, Region 4 is an offset peak next to the galaxy centre, and other regions are mostly on the spiral arms. Most of these regions show a similar \RCICO \sim 0.1, except for, e.g., Regions 20 and 22 which exhibit a somewhat higher ratio of \RCICO \sim 0.5. The edge of Region 4 also shows an enhancement of \CI  yet it is hard to tell whether this is physical or simply caused by edge effects, e.g., as seen in our simulations (Appendix~\ref{appendix: simulation}).$
$We also examined the integrated spectra of each region in Appendix~\ref{appendix: all regions}.$
$The \CI  and CO line profiles are not always well-matched in width and shape. In the galaxy centre (Region 1) and at bright bar-ends (Regions 2, 3, 5), \CI  and CO have similar line widths but \CI  has a lower intensity than CO, whereas in some fainter regions (9, 10, 13, 14), \CI  is narrower than CO and relatively weaker. In Regions 4, 20 and 22 where \RCICO is high, \CI  and CO have similar line widths but the \CI  intensity is enhanced.$
$In NGC~4321 (Fig.~\ref{fig: NGC4321 line ratio map}), we mapped a smaller area due to its fainter CO brightness than NGC~3627. There are no regions with \Remark{CO21} integrated intensities >100  \Kkms outside our selected area in NGC~4321, whereas in comparison the NGC~3627 bar ends have \Remark{CO21} integrated intensities \gtrsim 300  \Kkms. The \CI  mapping in NGC~4321 has a similar depth as in NGC~3627.$
$We marked 7 regions in NGC~4321 to guide the visual inspection. A clear \RCICO  newcommandicit can be seen in the galaxy centre (Region 1), with \RCICO \sim 0.06, nearly a factor of two smaller than its inner disk which has similar \RCICO \sim 0.1 as seen in the NGC~3627 disk. Some \CI  enhancement can be found at the edges or slightly outside these regions, where CO and \CI  are both faint (\Remark{ICO21} \sim 30-100  \Kkms) and the edge effect of interferometric missing flux might play a role (see Appendix~\ref{appendix: simulation}).$
$The \RCICO  spatial distributions of the other two starburst/AGN galaxies (Fig.~\ref{fig: other line ratio maps}) show in general more enhanced \RCICO  than in the NGC~3627 and NGC~4321 disks.$
$Large variations from the centres to outer areas can be seen, especially at the the S/N threshold of \sim 3 \text{--} 5 (see contours).$
$To quantify the spatial co-localization of the \CI  and CO emission, we use the \incode{JACoP} tool \citep{JACoP} \footnote{\url{https://imagej.net/plugins/jacop}}$
$in the \incode{ImageJ} software \citep{ImageJ} to measure the commonly used co-localization indicators, namely the Pearson's coefficient (PC; equal to 0 and 1 for null and 100\% localization, respectively) and Manders' coefficients (M1 and M2; which measure the overlap between two images and are equal to one for perfect overlap). We turn on the option of using Costes' automatic threshold \citep{Costes2004} which automatically set a pixel value threshold for each image to minimize the contribution of noise for the comparison \citep{JACoP}.$
$For the \CI  and CO emission in our galaxies, we find \mathrm{PC/M1/M2} values all very close to 1, that is, nearly 100\% co-localization (\mathrm{PC/M1/M2} = 0.934/0.985/0.990 for NGC~3627, 0.816/0.986/0.964 for NGC~4321, 0.978/0.890/0.906 for NGC~1808, and 0.935/0.999/0.998 for NGC~7469).$
$Overall, the spatial comparison of the \CI  and CO intensities demonstrates that the two species are well-correlated when observed at hundred parsec scales.$
$Meanwhile, we do see certain spectral differences in the line profiles as shown in Appendix~\ref{appendix: all regions}. This may suggest that variations exist at smaller scales than our resolution, which could be the sign of different evolutionary stages \citep[e.g.][]{Kruijssen2014} and would be interesting for higher-resolution follow-ups, e.g., with the main ALMA 12m array.$

$\subsection{\RCICO versus CO surface brightness and gas surface density}$
$In Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO} we show the scatter points of \CI  and CO line brightnesses and the \RCICO  line ratios.$
$Systematic differences in \RCICO can be found among these galaxies and within their galactic environments. We discuss these environments separately as follows.$
$\subsubsection{Star-forming and starburst disk environments}$
$The majority of molecular gas in the 3--7~kpc star-forming disks of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321 exhibits a tight distribution of \RCICO around 0.1 (within about \pm50\%). The distribution is fairly flat over an order of magnitude in \Remark{ICO21}. We denote this as the "SF disk" regime.$
$The ratio rises to about 0.2 within a galactocentric radius of few hundred parsec to \sim 1~kpc starburst areas in NGC~1808 and NGC~7469, which we newcommandine as the "SB disk" regime.$
$The nearly flat "SB disk" distribution is consistent with earlier studies. \citet{Salak2019} found that in NGC~1808 \Remark{ICI10} is proportional to \Remark{ICO21}^{ +1.05}. They also studied CO(1--0), finding that \Remark{ICI10} \propto \Remark{ICO10}^{ +1.46}, i.e., with a steeper slope.$
$\citet{Saito2020} found a similar slope between \Remark{ICI10} and \Remark{ICO10}: \Remark{ICI10} \propto \Remark{ICO10}^{ +1.54} in IRAS~F18293-3413 (whose CO(2--1) data is insufficient for such a study as previously mentioned).$
$This correlation slope is likely to change with different CO transitions due to the CO excitation's dependence on the CO luminosity or star formation rate themselves (e.g., \citealt{Daddi2015,Liudz2021a}).$
$For higher-J CO transitions, \citet{Michiyama2021} studied \CI  and CO(4--3) lines in 36 (U)LIRGs, finding \Remark{ICI10} \propto \Remark{ICO43}^{ +0.97}.$
$The upward tails seen at the CO-faint-end in the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO} are mostly due to the detection limits in each galaxy. The color shading indicates the 5-\sigma limit for each galaxy, assuming a typical line width of 10~km~s^{-1}. Region~22 of NGC~3627 and the outer pixels in the two starburst/AGN galaxies make the tips of the blue and gray faint-end tails, respectively. But most of these features should still be spurious. We performed CASA simulations following the real observations of NGC~3627 to verify what we would get if \RCICO  were constant across the galaxies (Appendix~\ref{appendix: simulation})$
$We find that noise can indeed boost a simulated \RCICO  of 0.2 to a measurement as high as 0.5 in a NGC~3627-like large mosaic, or even higher to >1 in single-pointing ALMA data without total power or sufficient short spacing. However, the faint-end tail from the simulation is not very similar to that of NGC~3627, raising some questions about the nature of the high-\RCICO  in Region~22.$
$Furthermore, we also did stacking experiments using the CO line profile as the prior to measure the \CI  line fluxes in bins of CO line brightnesses or galactocentric radii. We find no systematically higher \RCICO  at fainter CO pixels or at the outer radii.$
$\subsubsection{Galaxy centre environments}$
$Most interestingly, the \lesssim 250~pc centres of all four galaxies show dramatically different \RCICO. It varies by a factor of ten from \sim 0.05 in the centre of NGC~4321  to \sim 0.1 in the centre of NGC~3627, then to \sim 0.15--0.2 at the centre of NGC~1808, and to \sim 0.2--0.5 in the nucleus of NGC~7469.$
$This "nuclei" trend has a slope of about 0.8, i.e., \Remark{ICI10} \approx 0.035 \; \Remark{ICO21}^{ +0.8}, and corresponds to a \Sigmol range of about 10^{3} to 10^{4} \; \Mspc2 if adopting an \alphaCO = 4.3  \mathrm{M_{\odot} \; (K   km   s^{-1}   pc^2)^{-1}} (\citealt{Bolatto2013}) and a CO excitation R_{21} = 0.65 (\citealt{Leroy2021c}).$
$The reasons for the nuclei showing this trend likely include both the effect of varying [\CI/CO] abundance ratio and the excitation and radiative transfer. They are determined by the actual ISM conditions in each environment, i.e., the gas kinetic temperature, \CI  and CO column densities (\CIcolumndensity and \COcolumndensity), line widths (\Delta{v}), and \mathrm{H_2} volume density (\nHtwo), etc.$
$They will be analyzed in Sect.~\ref{sec: Excitation Analysis}.$
$\subsubsection{Histogram and curve-of-growth of the line ratio distributions}$
$Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio histogram} shows the histogram and cumulative distribution functions of \RCICO (left panel) and the mean \RCICO and the 16-th to 84-th percentiles in bins of CO line intensity (right panel) in our galaxies.$
$The histogram is computed as the sum of CO line intensity in each bin of \RCICO, representing the amount of gas at each \RCICO.$
$The NGC~4321 histogram is lower than others, showing that it has the least total molecular gas mass among the four galaxies within mapped areas. The NGC~3627 histogram has a peak about 0.5~dex higher than that of NGC~4321, but their peak locations are consistently at \log \RCICO \sim -1, same conclusion as our previous scatter plots show.$
$The two SB galaxies NGC~1808 and NGC~7469, despite having much smaller observed areas (\sim 1--2~kpc), have more than an order of magnitude higher peaks hence total molecular gas masses.$
$The locations of their histogram peaks also shift to a systematically higher \RCICO.$
$It is clearly seen that both SF and SB disks lack a high-\RCICO (\log \RCICO > -0.35) gas component which dominates the gas in the strong AGN host galaxy NGC~7469.$
$The curve-of-growth in the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio histogram} further shows the cumulative CO brightness in bins of \RCICO, and reflects the fact that the majority of gas in our galactic disks has a narrow distribution of \RCICO (see also last few rows in Table~\ref{table: targets}).$
$In NGC~3627, NGC~4321 and NGC~1808, the higher- and lower-\RCICO gas outside \pm 0.1~dex around the mean \RCICO only sums up to <5--10\% of their total gas masses.$
$In the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio histogram}, we illustrate how the mean \RCICO changes with different gas surface density, as well as the scatter of the data point distribution. The 2D pixels are binned by CO brightness, and the mean and 16\%/50\%/84\%-th percentiles of the \RCICO are computed for each bin.$
$It sketches out the mean trends in Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO} (right panel), and also reveals that$
$a) the scatter of \RCICO is the largest (\pm 0.20~dex) in the starburst disk of NGC~7469 compared to other galaxies;$
$b) the scatter is the smallest (\pm 0.06~dex) in the star-forming disks of NGC~4321 and NGC~3627 where \Sigmol \sim 100 \text{--} 500 \; \Mspc2;$
$c) the scatters are very similarly (\pm 0.10~dex) at a relatively high \Sigmol \sim 1000 \; \Mspc2 in all our galaxies except for NGC~4321's centre.$
$\subsection{\RCICO versus ISRF}$

$\caption{$
$    Line ratio versus mean ISRF intensity \Umean measured from SED fitting to the near- to far-IR (\textit{Spitzer}, \textit{Herschel}) data.$
$    \textit{Left four panels} are the \Umean maps of NGC~3627, NGC~4321, NGC~1808 and NGC~7469, and as described in Sect.~\ref{subsection: ISRF} are obtained from the works done by J. Chastenet et al. (in prep.) as a continued effort of \citet{Chastenet2021}.$
$    \textit{Right panel} shows the scatter plot of \RCICO versus \Umean at a spatial resolution of \sim 18" in the manually-selected apertures shown in the left panels.$
$    We computed a beam-weighted mean \RCICO and a centre pixel \RCICO for each aperture, displayed as the solid and open symbols, respectively.$
$    Error bars are the corresponding beam-weighted mean or central pixel \RCICO  uncertainties in each region.$
$    The region diameter (\sim 18") corresponds to the coarsest resolution of the \textit{Herschel} data used in the SED fitting.$
$    The gray dotted line shows \RCICO = 0.07   U^{0.25} as a guiding line.$
$    The colored dotted contours (labeled 0.1--0.5) are the model contours of \RCICO computed from the PDR Toolbox (using the latest \incode{wk2020} model and solar metallicity; \citealt{Kaufman2006}). We convert G_0 from the model contour to the x-axis U by multiplying with a factor of 0.88 (\citealt{Draine2007}).$
$    The right y-axis indicates the PDR model's \nHtwo, whose range is manually adjusted so that the model contours roughly match the left x-axis.$
$    The PDR model contours show little dependence of \RCICO on U in the horizontal direction but a strong correlation with \nHtwo as seen by the vertical gradient.$
$\label{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}$
$}\vspace{1ex}$
$\end{figure*}$
$Here we study how \RCICO  correlates with the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) intensity (U; in units of Milky Way mean ISRF; \citealt{Habing1968}), which is a measure of the UV radiation field strength impacting the ISM. Since \CI  originates from PDRs, its abundance should be highly related to the PDR properties, thus whether or how \RCICO  correlates with the ISRF that illuminates the PDR is a key question.$
$The ISRF intensity U is usually measured by the re-radiated dust emission, as the original UV photons are highly attenuated by dust in the ISM. \citet[][hereafter DL07]{DL07} developed a series of dust grain models and synthesized SED templates that can describe nearby galaxies' observed dust SEDs. A number of studies (e.g., \citealt{Draine2007,Galliano2011,Dale2012,Aniano2012,Aniano2020,Daddi2015,Chastenet2017,Liudz2021a,Chastenet2021}) have used the DL07 models to fit the dust SEDs of galaxies near and far.$
$For our study, we adopt the mass-averaged ISRF \Umean maps from an ongoing effort by J. Chastenet et al. (in prep.) which is a continuation of the work published for other galaxies by \citet{Chastenet2017,Chastenet2021} with the same method.$
$In this method, the \textit{Herschel} far-infrared, \textit{Spitzer} and/or \textit{WISE} near-infrared images \footnote{For the two (U)LIRGs, the WISE maps are saturated, so their inferred ISRF intensity U should be considered with a large uncertainty.} are first PSF-matched to a common resolution \sim 18" (\textit{Herschel} SPIRE 250\mum), then SED fitting is performed using the DL07 models at each pixel.$
$Each dust SED is fitted by two dust components, one in the ambient ISM with a constant ISRF intensity U_{\mathrm{min}}, and the other in regions with higher U with a power law distributed ISRF from U_{\mathrm{min}} up to U_{\mathrm{max}} = 10^{7}.$
$The fitting then gives the best-fit U_{\mathrm{min}} and the power-law index \gamma of the U distribution.$
$The mean ISRF intensity \Umean is calculated as the dust mass-weighted mean of the ambient and power-law ISRF intensities (in DL07, U_{\rm PDR} \ge 10^2 is considered to be associated with the PDR), and better represents the overall ISRF than U_{\mathrm{min}}.$
$Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF} presents the \Umean maps and the \RCICO  versus \Umean scatter plot. Since the spatial resolution of the \Umean maps is 18", we calculate a weighted \RCICO in each circular aperture shown in Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF} whose diameter equals the \Umean map resolution, with weighting following the 2D Gaussian beam.$
$In addition, we also show the central pixel value for each region in Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}.$
$We restrict the analysis to regions where both \Umean and \RCICO  are measured.$
$A weak correlation between \RCICO  and \Umean is seen from the SF to SB disks, with a large scatter. For reference, we plot a \RCICO = 0.07   U^{0.25} line to indicate this weak trend. The lowest-\Umean data point in NGC~3627 (mainly Region~22) and the centre of NGC~7469 do not follow this trend, possibly indicating other \CI  enhancement mechanisms than \Umean.$
$We use the popular PDR modelling software, PDR Toolbox (version 2.2.9; \citealt{Kaufman2006,Pound2008,pdrtoolbox}) \footnote{\url{https://dustem.astro.umd.edu/}; \url{https://github.com/mpound/pdrtpy}.}$
$to compute the theoretical \RCICO in uniform grids of ISRF intensity in the \citet{Habing1968} G_0 unit and H nucleus density n_{\mathrm{H}} (both in log space). We adopt the latest \incode{wk2020} model set and a solar metallicity (\mathrm{[O/H_2]} = 3.2 \times 10^{-4}, \mathrm{[C/H_2]} = 1.6 \times 10^{-4}).$
$The ISRF intensity grid can be directly scaled to U by multiplying a factor 0.88 (\citealt{Draine2007}), corresponding to the x-axis of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}.$
$The n_{\mathrm{H}} grid is not directly linked to the left y-axis of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}, but because the model contours show fairly flat \RCICO versus U trends, we can match the model contours and indicate the n_{\mathrm{H}} grid in the right y-axis of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}.$
$The PDR modelling predicts generally flat \RCICO versus U trends similar to the distribution of the observed data points, although our U are diluted values at a much larger physical scale than in the PDR models.$
$However, in PDR models, \RCICO  changes moderately with n_{\mathrm{H}}, and a relatively high n_{\mathrm{H}} \sim 10^{3.5\text{--}3.7}   \mathrm{cm^{-3}} is needed to reproduce an \RCICO \sim 0.1--0.2, or equivalently \sim 1.0--1.9 for the ratio of \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO21} fluxes in \mathrm{erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} sr^{-1}} units used by the PDR Toolbox \footnote{See \url{https://github.com/mpound/pdrtpy-nb/blob/master/notebooks/PDRT_Example_Model_Plotting.ipynb}.$
$We scale the ratio of intensities in \mathrm{erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} sr^{-1}} to the ratio of intensities in \mathrm{K km s^{-1}} by a factor of (\nu_{\mathrm{CI10}}/\nu_{\mathrm{CO21}})^{-3} = 9.73, where \nu is the rest-frame frequency of the lines. We caution that the old version of \incode{PDRToolbox} \incode{v2.1.1} does not include the \incode{CI_609/CO_21} line ratio, but has \incode{CI_609/CO_43} and \incode{CO_43/CO_21} ratios. However, we tested that the multiplication of \incode{CI_609/CO_43} and \incode{CO_43/CO_21} does not produce the same result as the direct \incode{CI_609/CO_21} ratio in the new \incode{PDRToolbox} \incode{v2.2.9}. We use the new version for this work.$
$}.$
$Furthermore, the PDR model needs a \sim0.5~dex lower n_{\mathrm{H}} to explain the 2\times elevated \RCICO  in SB disks, which seems somewhat counterintuitive.$
$This apparent tension is likely caused by the observations probing a much coarser resolution that consists of a large number of PDRs with different n_{\mathrm{H}} and U (e.g., increasing U from 10 to 400 can increase \RCICO from 0.2 to 0.5 based on our PDR Toolbox modelling). It may also relate to an abundance variation driven by non-PDR mechanisms ---$
$X-ray dominated region (XDR; \citealt{Maloney1996,Meijerink2005,Meijerink2007}; see also review by \citealt{Wolfire2022}) and Cosmic Ray Dominated Region (CRDR; \citealt{Papadopoulos2010c,Papadopoulos2011,Papadopoulos2018,Bisbas2015,Bisbas2017}) are well-known to play an important role in starbursting and AGN environments, respectively.$

$As pointed out by \citet{Papadopoulos2011} and later works, ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with IR luminosities L_{\mathrm{IR, 8-1000\mu\mathrm{m}}} \ge 10^{12}   \Lsun and corresponding \mathrm{SFRs} > 1000   \Msyr have cosmic-ray (CR) energy densities \sim 10^{3} \text{--} 10^{4}\times larger than the Milky Way. In our sample, the two SB galaxies are not as intensively star-forming as ULIRGs, but their SFRs are still a factor of 2 to 20 higher than our SF galaxies. More importantly, the SB disks have considerably higher (e.g., one to two orders of magnitude) SFR surface densities than the SF disks, plausibly leading to a factor of a few tens to hundreds higher CR intensities. The CRs emitted from OB star clusters and supernova remnants can penetrate deeply into the ISM, and thus nearly uniformly illuminate the ISM and effectively dissociate CO into \CI .$
$A detailed simulation by \citet{Bisbas2017} showed that 10\times and 100\times higher CR ionization rates (\xi_{\mathrm{CR}}) than the Milky Way level results into a factor of about 2 and 3 mildly-increased \CI  abundance and about 1/2 and 1/30 strongly-decreased CO abundance, respectively (see their Fig.~3), in a 10~pc GMC with a mean gas density \left<n_{\mathrm{H}} \right>= 760   \mathrm{cm^{-3}}, resembling Milky Way and typical SF galaxies' ISM conditions.$
$Our SB galaxies probably have a \xi_{\mathrm{CR}} around or slightly above 10, but not reaching 100 given their mild \Umean \sim 20-30 compared to the \Umean \gtrsim 50 in extreme SB galaxies, e.g., local ULIRGs and high-redshift hyperluminous IR-bright (HyLIRG) and submm galaxies (\citealt{Daddi2015,Silverman2018,Liudz2021a}).$
$In Sect.~\ref{sec: Excitation Analysis}, we show that the mildly-increased [\CI/CO] abundance ratio from a CRDR and temperature/density-driven excitation can lead to the factor of 2 increase in \RCICO  when going from SF to SB disks.$
$\subsection{\RCICO versus Metallicity}$
$\label{subsec: metallicity}$
$Our current sample covers a relatively small range in metallicity for a metallicity--line ratio study. Given their stellar masses and metallicity maps (e.g., \citealt{Kreckel2019,Kreckel2020,Williams2022}), our targets probe a near-solar metallicity. NGC~3627 has a well-measured$
$metallicity gradient of Z = 8.53 + 0.06 \times[r/R_{25}] from \citet{Kreckel2019} \footnote{\citet{Kreckel2019} used a distance of 10.6 \pm 0.9 \; \mathrm{Mpc} for NGC~3627. We do not directly use this metallicity gradient, but use the metallicity maps from \citet{Williams2022} where the same new distance as in this work is adopted.}, but the metallicity of individual \ionizedhydrogen  regions scatter between \sim 8.45--8.65.$
$\citet{Williams2022} produced the 2D spatial distributions of gas-phase metallicity in PHANGS-MUSE galaxies, including NGC~3627 and NGC~4321, by applying the Gaussian Process Regression to map the smooth, higher-order metallicity variation from the individual, sparse \ionizedhydrogen  regions detected in PHANGS-MUSE (\citealt{PHANGSMUSE, Santoro2021}).$
$This method is significantly superior to a naïve nearest neighbor interpolation method. We refer the reader to \citet{Williams2022} for the technical details and validation demonstration.$
$In Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs metallicity} we present the trend between \RCICO  and metallicity in NGC~3627 and NGC~4321.$
$Due to our limited metallicity range, only a very weak decreasing trend can be seen.$
$A similar trend has been reported by \citet{Bolatto2000b}, who observed CO(1--0) and \Remark{CI10} in the Region N27 of the Small Magellanic Cloud and combined with literature data to present a correlation between \RCICO  and metallicity over \sim 0.2 \text{--} 2   Z_{\odot}.$
$We overlay the \citet{Bolatto2000b} empirical fitting \footnote{$
$We adopt the equation from \citep[][Fig.~2 caption]{Bolatto2000b}, with a typo-correction in the brackets so that the equations are:$
$\log ( F_{\Remark{CI10}} / F_{\Remark{CO10}} ) = -0.47   \left[12 + \log \mathrm{(O/H)} \right]+ 5.0 and \log ( F_{\Remark{CI10}} / F_{\Remark{CO10}} ) = -0.82   \left[12 + \log \mathrm{(O/H)} \right]+ 8.2, respectively, where F is the line flux in \mathrm{erg   s^{-1}   cm^{-2}   sr^{-1}}.$

$as well as a theoretical PDR model prediction line from \citet{Bolatto1999} in Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs metallicity}.$
$Although our data covers only a small metallicity range, it is encouraging to see the overall good agreement with the observationally-driven trend in \citet{Bolatto2000b}.$
$More detailed understanding of the deviation from PDR models will likely need more \CI  mapping in lower-metallicity galaxies.$

$The observed \RCICO  depends on not only the \CI  and CO abundances (\COabundance  and \CIabundance ), but also the ISM conditions that determine the excitation (level population) and radiative transfer of the C atoms and CO molecules --- i.e., the gas kinetic temperature \Tkin, volume density of H_2 (\nHtwo; as the primary collision partners of C and CO), turbulent line width \dv, and the species' column densities \COcolumndensity and \CIcolumndensity.$
$The column density divided by the line width (N/\dv) further determines the optical depth \tau of each line.$
$In this work, having only a CO(2--1) and a \Remark{CI10} line is insufficient to numerically solve all the \Tkin, \nHtwo, \COcolumndensity/\dv, \COabundance  and \CIabundance . Therefore, we assume several \textit{representative ISM conditions} where \Tkin, \dv and \COabundance  are fixed to reasonable values, then solve the \COcolumndensity and \CIcolumndensity. We assume that \CI  and CO are spatially mixed at our resolution, i.e., they have the same filling factor. This is a relatively strong assumption and is likely not the real case, because although we see spatial co-localization at our \sim 200~pc resolutions, the spectral profiles of CO and \CI show discrepancies (Appendix~\ref{appendix: all regions}), indicating different underlying distributions at smaller scales. With the assumption of the same filling factor (and 3D distribution), the column density ratio \CIcolumndensity/\COcolumndensity equals the [\CI/CO] abundance ratio.$
$We perform both LTE and non-LTE calculations.$
$LTE assumes that all transitions are thermalized locally, and the level population follows Boltzmann statistics, so that each transition's excitation temperature T_{\mathrm{ex}} as newcommandined by the level population equals \Tkin (e.g., \citealt{Spitzer1998Book,Tielens2010Book,Draine2011Book}). The LTE assumption facilitates the computation as we do not need to solve the level population and thus \nHtwo is not used.$
$However, LTE is not easily reached in typical ISM conditions. Subthermalized lines need non-LTE calculations. The commonly adopted non-LTE approach is the Large Velocity Gradient (LVG; \citealt{Scoville1974,Goldreich1974}), where an escape fraction is used to facilitate the local radiation intensity calculation hence the detailed balance of radiative and collisional (de-)excitations.$
$We use RADEX (\citealt{RADEX}) to compute the non-LTE \CI  and CO line fluxes for each fixed parameter set (\Tkin, \nHtwo, \COcolumndensity, \CIcolumndensity, \dv), then study how [\CI/CO] determines the line flux ratio \RCICO.$
$We assume the following 7 representative ISM conditions:$
$\textit{(1)} inner Galactic GMCs,$
$\textit{(2)} NGC~3627/4321 disk GMCs,$
$\textit{(3)} NGC~3627 bar-end environments,$
$\textit{(4)} NGC~1808/7469 SB disk,$
$\textit{(5)} NGC~4321 centre,$
$\textit{(6)} NGC~3627 centre,$
$and \textit{(7)} NGC~7469 centre.$
$Conditions \textit{(1)}--\textit{(3)} correspond to the "SF disk" in Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO}, and condition \textit{(4)} represents the "SB disk".$
$The last three conditions are for the "nuclei".$
$Under each ISM condition, we set a fixed \Tkin (in units of K), \dv (in units of km~s^{-1}), \COabundance , and \Sigmol (in units of \Mspc2).$
$The adopted values are shown at the top of each panel in Figs.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO} and \ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO}.$
$Our choice of \Tkin considered multi-line measurements in the literature, e.g., \citet{Heyer2015} for Galactic GMC ISM condition, and \citet{Teng2022} for NGC~3627 nucleus, as well as typical values in simulations (e.g., \citealt{Offner2014,Glover2015,Glover2016,Clark2019,HuChiaYu2021a}).$
$Our \dv is based on the observed line width in the highest-resolution ALMA data, i.e., from the original PHANGS-ALMA 1" data (\citealt{Leroy2021phangs}) or from \citet{Salak2019} and \citet{Izumi2020} for NGC~1808 and NGC~7469, respectively. The observed line width should at least new an upper limit, if not directly probing the turbulent \dv.$
$The \COabundance  is more like a fiducial value and does not obviously affect later [\CI/CO] results.$
$We also take a fiducial \Sigmol which matches the observed CO(1--0) line brightness temperature and a CO-to-H_2 conversion factor \alphaCO \sim 4 \text{--} 0.8 \; \mathrm{M_{\odot}   (K   km   s^{-1})^{-1}} depending on the assumed conditions (e.g., \citealt{Bolatto2013}; and our paper~II).$
$This \Sigmol directly converts to an N_{\mathrm{H_2}} if assuming that 36\% of the mass is helium. Then N_{\mathrm{H_2}} and \COabundance  together indicate a \COcolumndensity . Only with these assumptions can we unambiguously link an abundance ratio [\CI/CO] (i.e., \CIcolumndensity/\COcolumndensity) to a line flux ratio \RCICO .$
$Additionally, with the same filling factor assumption, \RCICOis also equivalent to the ratio of the CO-to-H_2 and \CI -to-H_2 conversion factors, i.e., \RCICO = \alphaCO/\alphaCI, because they trace the same molecular gas at our resolution.$
$In a companion paper (paper II; Liu et al. 2022 in prep.), we study the behaviors of \alphaCO and \alphaCI in more details, also under both LTE and non-LTE conditions.$

$    \label{fig: LTE RCICO}$
$\end{figure*}$
$We determine the LTE solution of [\CI/CO] in Fig.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}.$
$To illustrate the complexity of this problem and the degeneracy of the \Tkin, \COcolumndensity/\dv and [\CI/CO] parameters, we show how \RCICO (y-axis) varies with \RNCINCO (x-axis) and \COcolumndensity  (color bar) in the upper panels, and how \RCICO (contour) can be pinpointed by determining the \Sigmol (right y-axis).$
$At the top of each column the key parameters of the aforementioned representative ISM conditions are shown as text. The assumed \Tkin and \dv generally increase from panels (1) to (7) mimicking real conditions. Observational-driven \Remark{ICO10} ranges and the assumed \Sigmol for these ISM environments are also listed, and can be converted one into the other via \alphaCO. We also list the chosen \COabundance  for clarity.$
$As shown in the upper panels, \RCICO increases with both \RNCINCO and \COcolumndensity  under low-\Tkin conditions. However, a maximum \RCICO is reached in the high \CI  column density regime, where an increasing abundance ratio will no longer increase \RCICO. The line ratio saturates at about 0.5 when \Tkin \sim 15~K, or at about 1 for \Tkin \sim 100~K. The observed line ratios (horizontal dashed lines) are all lower than the saturation limit of \RCICO _{\mathrm{max}} \sim 0.7 \text{--} 0.9, and corresponds to a range of \COcolumndensity or \Sigmol. This range is very wide in the low-\Tkin conditions, with \log \COcolumndensity / \mathrm{cm^{-2}} \sim 17 - 19, but is very narrow at \Tkin \sim 100~K, that is, \RCICO can be determined from [\CI/CO] without much dependence on \COcolumndensity.$
$In the lower panels, the contours of \RCICO = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 are shown in the plane of CO column density \COcolumndensity versus \CI/CO abundance ratio.$
$For a fixed \RCICO , a higher \RNCINCO corresponds to a lower \COcolumndensity in the low-\Tkin regime, but \RCICO  becomes insensitive to \COcolumndensity at a high \Tkin. In the latter case, \RNCINCO alone determines \RCICO .$
$By matching to the expected \Sigmol for each ISM condition, we can obtain an unambiguous \RNCINCO from the observed \RCICO  as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}.$
$In this way, we determine the \RNCINCO to be around 0.1--0.2 for conditions \textit{(1)} and \textit{(2)}, and \sim 0.4 for conditions \textit{(3)} and \textit{(5)}.$
$The SB disk (condition \textit{4}) and AGN environments (conditions \textit{6}/\textit{7}) have \RNCINCO \sim 2 and \sim 1 \text{--} 10, respectively.$
$The strongly enhanced \CI/CO abundance ratios in SB disk and AGN environments are clear signatures of CRDR and XDR, respectively.$
$The NGC~4321 centre is a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER, e.g., \citealt{GarciaBurillo2005}), and given our assumptions it requires \RNCINCO \sim 0.4 in order to explain the observed low line ratio.$
$The gradually increasing \CI/CO abundance ratios in the nuclei of NGC~4321, NGC~3627, NGC~1808 and NGC~7469 agree well with the increasing power of AGN activities, e.g., their X-ray luminosities (Table~\ref{table: targets}).$
$Our assumptions for the Galactic cloud ISM condition are mainly based on \citet{Heyer2009}, \citet{Heyer2015} and \cite{RomanDuval2010}. The obtained [\CI/CO]~\sim 0.1 also agrees well with previous studies using \CI  and CO isotopologues (see Sect.~\ref{subsec: intro RCICO}.$
$For example, \citet{Ikeda1999} reported \RNCINCO \sim 0.05 \textnormal{--} 0.2 for the Orion cloud;$
$\citet{Oka2001} found \RNCINCO = 0.064 \pm 0.035 but a peak of \RNCINCO \sim 0.15 in the DR 15 \HII  region and two IR dark clouds;$
$\citet{Kramer2004} found \RNCINCO \sim 0.11 \textnormal{--} 0.12 in the massive SF region W3;$
$\citet{Genzel1988} found \RNCINCO \sim 0.2 for the massive SF region W51;$
$\citet{Zmuidzinas1988} reported \RNCINCO \sim 0.05 \textnormal{--} 0.15 in several dense clouds.$
$Recently, \citet{Izumi2021} derived an overall \RNCINCO \sim 0.1 in the massive SF region RCW38 at A_V \sim 10 \textnormal{--} 100, consistent with the Orion cloud, but also saw high [\CI/CO] \sim 0.2 \textnormal{--} 0.6 in some even lower column density regions.$
$Accurate determination of all the ISM properties instead of simple assumptions as in this work requires comprehensive, multi-J CO isotopologue observations (e.g., \citealt{Teng2022}).$
$Our representative ISM conditions only new a qualitative diagnostic to understand how to infer the \CI/CO abundance ratio from the observed \RCICO  quantity.$
$Their properties may not be very accurate, and are subject to change with future multi-tracer/CO isotopologue studies.$

$\subsection{Non-LTE results}$
$\label{subsec: non-LTE}$
$We perform the non-LTE calculations using the RADEX code (\citealt{vanderTak2007})$
$with the Large Velocity Gradient (LVG; i.e., expanding sphere) escape probability (\citealt{Scoville1974,Goldreich1974}).$
$Comparing to LTE, the volume density of H_2 is now an additional property that plays a role. The excitation temperature of each line no longer equals \Tkin.$
$We compute the non-LTE line ratios in a grid of ( \Tkin,   \dv,   \COabundance,   \RNCINCO,   \COcolumndensity,   \nHtwo ) parameter sets, then study the line and abundance ratios similarly as in the previous section.$
$In Fig.~\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} we show the non-LTE version of Fig.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}.$
$The non-LTE result does not qualitatively differ from that of LTE.$
$The most obvious difference is that at high temperature (\Tkin > 50~K, given our other assumed conditions), the required [\CI/CO] is lower by \times 2 for the same observed \RCICO, whereas at low temperature (\Tkin \sim 15~K) a \lesssim 2 \times [\CI/CO] is expected for the observed line ratio.$
$As listed in the title of each panel, we assume \log \nHtwo / \mathrm{cm^{-3}} = 2.5 to 3.0 for our conditions (1) to (7).$
$This is based on the fact that low-J CO and \CI  trace the bulk of molecular gas with \log \nHtwo / \mathrm{cm^{-3}} \sim 2--3 (e.g., \citealt{Leroy2017,Liudz2021a}), with a typical value \nHtwo \sim 300   \mathrm{cm^{-3}} widely adopted/found for Galactic and nearby galaxy GMCs (e.g., \citealt{Koda2012,Pety2017}, see also simulations of \citealt{Glover2012b}), whereas a smaller portion of their emission is from the dense gas with \log \nHtwo / \mathrm{cm^{-3}} \sim 4--6 (e.g., \citealt{Gao2004a}).$
$The fraction of the dense gas is expected to increase in more starbursting environment (\citealt{Gao2004b}), so does the mean gas density (\citealt{Liudz2021a}). Therefore, a \log \nHtwo / \mathrm{cm^{-3}} of 3.0 is perhaps a reasonable assumption, or at least a lower limit for our galaxy centres. A 10 \times higher density does not qualitatively change Fig.~\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} except for shifting the expected \RNCINCO to be 50\% higher in the \Tkin > 50~K conditions (making Fig.~\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} more like Fig.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}).$
$Therefore, our non-LTE result strongly confirms the LTE result in the previous section, that the intrinsic \CI/CO abundance has to vary significantly from about 0.1--0.2 to about 1--3, in order to explain the observed line ratios from Galactic GMCs (hundred pc scales) and NGC~3627/4321 SF disk GMCs to NGC~1808/7469 SB disk/AGN (r \lesssim 250~pc) environments.$
$\vspace{2ex}$
$\section{Discussion}$
$\label{sec: Discussion}$
$From this study we see that the line ratio \RCICO increases from 0.1 to 0.2 and > 0.5 from the SF disk to the SB disk and the vicinity (few hundred pc) of X-ray luminous AGN. Although we may be limited by our sample,$
$we suggest that this trend can be extended to general cases at both local and high redshift, because the \CI/CO abundance ratio enhancement is well-predicted by the CRDR and XDR theories.$
$\citet{Papadopoulos2010c} and \citet{Papadopoulos2011} pointed out the key role of CRDR in local (U)LIRGs. With UV photons alone, cold gas in starbursting environments can still be well shielded, hence as cold as \sim 10~K. However, with CRs produced from O, B star clusters and supernova remnants, the gas can be uniformly illuminated and heated up.$
$The extremely starbursty local ULIRGs have a CR density (\xi_{\mathrm{CR}}) 10^{3}--10^{4} times that of the Milky Way (\citealt{Papadopoulos2010c}), and thus will naturally dissociate more CO into \CI .$
$\citet{Bisbas2017} and \citet{Papadopoulos2018} conducted simulations of molecular gas at tens of pc scale with varying CR strength, and found that when \xi_{\mathrm{CR}} is \sim 1 \textnormal{--} 100   \times Galactic value, the gas temperature in the dense gas remains largely unaffected (\sim 10~K).$
$However, when \xi_{\mathrm{CR}} reaches \sim 1000   \times Galactic value as in (U)LIRGs, the gas temperature increases to 30--50~K. The \citet{Bisbas2017} simulation also shows that the \CI  and \ionizedcarbon  fractional abundances at \log A_V \sim 0.5 increase by one and three orders of magnitude, respectively, and the CO fractional abundance decreases correspondingly by over two orders of magnitude, with an increasing \xi_{\mathrm{CR}} from the Galactic value to 100   \times of that.$
$These results are in line with our calculations in Sect.~\ref{subsec: LTE}.$
$Meanwhile, the AGN-driven XDR chemistry and molecule/atom excitation have been firstly modeled in great detail by \citet{Maloney1996}, \citet{Meijerink2005} and \citet{Meijerink2007}. In XDRs, photo-ionization becomes the dominant heating source instead of photo-electric emission from dust grains in PDRs, thus more molecules are dissociated and/or ionized. \citet{Meijerink2005}'s Model~1 shows that CO molecules are fully dissociated when N_{\mathrm{H}} < 10^{23}   \mathrm{cm^{-2}}, then the fractional abundance is gradually increased by six orders of magnitudes from N_{\mathrm{H}} = 10^{23}   \mathrm{cm^{-2}} to 10^{24}   \mathrm{cm^{-2}}. By contrast, the \CI  and \ionizedcarbon  abundances are about constant until reaching the densest part (N_{\mathrm{H}} > 10^{24.5}   \mathrm{cm^{-2}}). Unlike in PDRs, there is no clear \ionizedcarbon /\CI /CO stratification in XDRs (\citealt{Meijerink2007,Wolfire2022}). Their Model~2 with a 100 \times higher energy deposition rate shows that the CO distribution contracts to the highest gas density spots, and the total cumulative [\CI/CO] is increased by about 0.2~dex, reaching \RNCINCO \sim 1.6.$
$This value agrees well with our calculations shown in Figs.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO} and \ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} (the ISM condition 7).$
$Therefore, both in theoretical and observational views, it is clear that the \RCICO line ratio is a good indicator of the starburst's CRDR and AGN's XDR.$
$If a \RCICO line ratio (to be specific, \Remark{ICI10}/\Remark{ICO21}) reaches 0.2--0.5, then the CRDR plays a crucial role and the abundance ratio [\CI/CO] could be \sim 1.$
$If it exceeds 0.5--1.0, then it may only be enhanced by an XDR, e.g., caused by an X-ray luminous AGN, which boosts the abundance ratio [\CI/CO] to \gtrsim 1--2.$

$\section{Conclusion}$
$\label{sec: Conclusion}$
$We presented new beam- and uv-coverage-matched \Remark{CI10} and CO(2--1) maps in the galactocentric radius r \lesssim 7~kpc SF disk of NGC~3627 at \sim 190~pc resolution, and in the r \lesssim 3~kpc disk of NGC~4321 at \sim 270~pc resolution.$
$They are among the largest \CI  mosaic mappings available in nearby galaxies.$
$We combined the imaging of \Remark{CI10} and CO(2--1) in two nearby, more starbursty and AGN-hosting galaxies, i.e., NGC~1808 central \sim1~kpc, and NGC~7469 central \sim1.5~kpc at 140--160~pc resolutions.$
$Together, we studied the spatial distributions of \CI  and CO, and their line ratio \RCICO as functions of various galaxy resolved properties, including CO brightness (Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO}), ISRF \Umean (Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}), and metallicity (Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs metallicity}).$
$In order to obtain the underlying intrinsic [\CI/CO] abundance ratio from the observed line ratio \RCICO, we assumed 7 representative ISM conditions and did both LTE and non-LTE calculations.$
$\vspace{1ex}$
$We summarize our findings as below:$
$\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0ex,topsep=1ex,leftmargin=4ex]$
$    \item The majority of the molecular gas in the SF disks of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321 has a uniform \Remark{RCI10CO21} = 0.10 \pm 0.05.$
$    \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO21} exhibit very similar spatial distributions at our 140--270~pc resolution.$
$    \item The majority of the molecular gas in the SB disk of NGC~1808 has \Remark{RCI10CO21} = 0.20 \pm 0.05.$
$    This elevated line ratio compared to the SF disk is likely caused by a \sim 3 \text{--} 5 \times increased [\CI/CO] abundance ratio, based on our LTE and non-LTE calculations and parameter assumptions (Figs.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO} and \ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO}).$
$    \item The centres (r \lesssim 250~pc) of NGC~4321, NGC~3627, NGC~1808 and NGC~7469 show a strongly increasing trend in \Remark{RCI10CO21}, from 0.05 to 0.5, as a function of I_{\Remark{CO21}} --- i.e., \Remark{RCI10CO21} \approx 0.035   (I_{\Remark{CO21}}/[100\;\Kkms])^{0.8}.$
$    The inferred [\CI/CO] abundance ratio from our non-LTE calculation changes from \sim 0.2 to \sim 3, in line with the increasing X-ray luminosity of the centres/AGNs.$
$    \item The observed \RCICO versus ISRF trend is fairly flat, i.e., \RCICO  is insensitive to ISRF intensity changes, similar to the PDR model prediction calculated with PDRToolbox (although our resolution is much coarser than the physical scale of PDR models; Sect.~\ref{subsection: ISRF}).$
$    \item We find a \RCICO versus metallicity trend consistent with previous observations that covered lower-metallicity environments (\sim 0.2   \mathrm{Z_{\odot}}; \citealt{Bolatto2000b}), within the metallicity range (\sim 0.7 \text{--} 1   \mathrm{Z_{\odot}}) of our sample (Sect.~\ref{subsec: metallicity}).$
$    \item Our inferred [\CI/CO] abundance ratios agree well with the CRDR and XDR's theoretical studies.$
$    Given the drastically changed \RCICO , we propose that the \CI  to CO line ratio can be a promising indicator of CRDR (starbursting) and XDR (AGN). For instance, an observed line flux ratio of$
$    \Remark{RCI10CO21} \sim 0.2 \textnormal{--} 0.5 and \gtrsim 0.5 effectively indicates CRDR and XDR, respectively.$
$    \item We do not find ubiquitous "CO-dark", \CI -bright gas at the outer r\sim 1 \text{--} 3~kpc disks of NGC~3627 and NGC4321, nor systematic enhancement in \RCICO  at CO-faintest sightlines via stacking, mainly due to the incompleteness of our data.$
$    Nevertheless, a few sightlines, e.g., Region~22 in NGC~3627 show high \RCICO ~\sim 0.5 which do not fully comply with the noise behavior seen in our CASA simulations.$

$We present new neutral atomic carbon [C~\textsc{i}]~( ^3P_1~\to~ ^3P_0) mapping observations within the inner \sim 7~kpc and \sim 4~kpc of the disks of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321 at a spatial resolution of 190~pc and 270~pc, respectively, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) Atacama Compact Array (ACA).$
$We combine these with the CO(2--1) data from PHANGS-ALMA, and literature [C~\textsc{i}] and CO data for two other starburst and/or active galactic nucleus (AGN) galaxies (NGC~1808, NGC~7469), to study: \textit{a)} the spatial distributions of C~\textsc{i} and CO emission; \textit{b)} the observed line ratio \RCICO = I_{\mathrm{[C{\normalfont\textsc{i}}]}(1\textnormal{--}0)} / I_{\mathrm{CO}(2\textnormal{--}1)} as a function of various galactic properties; and \textit{c)} the abundance ratio of [C~\textsc{i}/CO].$
$We find excellent spatial correspondence between C~\textsc{i} and CO emission and nearly uniform \RCICO \sim 0.1 across the majority of the star-forming disks of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321.$
$However, \RCICO strongly varies from \sim 0.05 at the centre of NGC~4321 to > 0.2 \text{--} 0.5 in NGC~1808's starbursting centre and NGC~7469's centre with an X-ray-luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN).$
$Meanwhile, \RCICOdoes not obviously vary with \Umean, similar to the prediction of photodissociation dominated region (PDR) models.$
$We also find a mildly decreasing \RCICOwith an increasing metallicity over 0.7\text{--}0.85 \mathrm{Z_{\odot}}, consistent with the literature.$
$Assuming various typical ISM conditions representing giant molecular clouds, active star-forming regions and strong starbursting environments, we calculate the local-thermodynamic-equilibrium radiative transfer and estimate the [C~\textsc{i}/CO] abundance ratio to be \sim 0.1 across the disks of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321, similar to previous large-scale findings in Galactic studies.$
$However, this abundance ratio likely has a substantial increase to \sim 1 and \gtrsim 1--5 in NGC~1808's starburst and NGC~7469's strong AGN environments, respectively, in line with the expectations for cosmic-ray dominated region (CRDR) and X-ray dominated region (XDR) chemistry.$
$Finally, we do not find a robust evidence for a generally CO-dark, C~\textsc{i}-bright gas in the disk areas we probed.$

$\section{Introduction}$
$\label{subsec: intro RCICO}$
$\subsection{Neutral atomic carbon in the interstellar medium}$
$Neutral atomic carbon (C^0 or \neutralcarbon) is an important phase of carbon in the interstellar medium (ISM) besides ionized carbon (C^+ or \ionizedcarbon) and carbon monoxide (CO).$
$Its ^{3}P state is split into three fine-structure levels. The^{3}P_{1} \to  ^{3}P_{0} transition line at 492.16065~GHz,$
$hereafter \Remark{CI10}$
$, has an upper energy level of E_u = 23.620~K and a critical density of n_{\mathrm{crit}} \sim 1.0 \times 10^{3} \;\mathrm{cm^{-3}} (at a temperature of 50~K) \footnote{n_{\mathrm{crit}} \equiv A / \gamma, where A is the Einstein A coefficient for the transition and \gamma the rate of collisional de-excitation with hydrogen molecules, with values from \cite{Schroder1991} as compiled in the Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database (\citealt{Schoier2005}), \url{https://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~moldata/}},$
$and the^{3}P_{2} \to  ^{3}P_{1} transition line at 809.34197~GHz has E_u = 62.462~K and n_{\mathrm{crit}} \sim 3.4 \times 10^{3} \;\mathrm{cm^{-3}}.$
$Therefore, they are easily excited in the cold ISM environment.$
$Given the high abundance of carbon in the ISM, \neutralcarbon, CO and \ionizedcarbon  are the most powerful cold ISM tracers, and are the most widely used tools to probe cold ISM properties and hence galaxy evolution at cosmological distances.$
$The interstellar \neutralcarbon  is produced from$
$the photodissociation of CO molecules by UV photons and the recombination of \ionizedcarbon , both happening in photodissociation regions (PDRs; \citealt{Langer1976,deJong1980,Tielens1985a,Tielens1985b,vanDishoeck1986,vanDishoeck1988,Sternberg1989,Sternberg1995,Hollenbach1991,Hollenbach1999,Kaufman1999,Wolfire2010,Madden2020,Bisbas2021}, also see reviews by \citealt{Genzel1989,Jaffe1985,Hollenbach1997,Wolfire2022}).$
$In the simple plane-parallel (i.e., 1-D) PDR model, \neutralcarbon  exists in a layer where UV photons can penetrate through the molecular gas but cannot maintain a high carbon ionizing rate.$
$Such a layer is suggested to have an intermediate gas surface density (N_{\mathrm{H_2}} \sim 1 \textnormal{--} 4 \times 10^{20} \;\mathrm{cm^{-2}}), fairly cold temperature (10 to a few tens K), and moderate visual extinction (A_V \sim 1 - 4).$
$CO molecules dominate the more shielded interior of this layer and \ionizedcarbon  dominates the exterior.$
$Hydrogen molecules are gradually photodissociated to atoms across this layer (A_V \sim 0.1 - 4).$
$This plane-parallel scenario qualitatively explains the layered structure of the Orion Bar PDR in our Galaxy on sub-pc scales (e.g.,  \citealt{Genzel1989,Tielens1993,Tauber1994,Hogerheijde1995b,Hollenbach1999,Goicoechea2016}), and the \rho~Ophiuchi~A PDR in a recent study with an unprecedented resolution of 360~AU (\citealt{Yamagishi2021}), where the interplay between individual young, massive (O, B) stars and the ISM can be directly observed.$
$However, such simple models cannot fully explain molecular clouds. Plenty of observations in Galactic molecular clouds, \ionizedhydrogen  regions and star-formation complexes have revealed a widespread \neutralcarbon  distribution over most areas of molecular clouds on scales of a few to ten pc, and a relatively high \neutralcarbon  fractional abundance even at a large A_V depth > 10~mag (\citealt{Phillips1980,Phillips1981,Wootten1982,Keene1985,Keene1987,Jaffe1985,Zmuidzinas1986,Zmuidzinas1988,Genzel1988,Frerking1989,Plume1994,Plume1999,Gerin1998a,Tatematsu1999,Ikeda1999,Ikeda2002,Yamamoto2001,Zhang2001,Kamegai2003,Oka2004,Izumi2021}).$
$This observational evidence actually requires PDRs to be clumpy  (\citealt{Stutzki1988,Genzel1988,Burton1990,Meixner1993,Spaans1997,Kramer2004,Kramer2008,Pineda2008,Sun2008}), with a volume filling factor much less than unity (e.g., \sim 0.1 - 0.3; \citealt{Stutzki1988}), so that$
$UV photons can penetrate through most of the cloud, except for the densest clumps.$
$Therefore, the spatial co-existence of \neutralcarbon  and low rotational transition (low-J) CO lines can be well explained by such an inter-clump medium inside the molecular clouds.$
$Alternatively, cosmic rays (CRs) have also been proposed to be the reason for the \neutralcarbon -CO association as they can penetrate much deeper than UV photons into clouds, and thus more uniformly dissociate CO molecules into \neutralcarbon  inside clouds (\citealt{Field1969,Padovani2009,Papadopoulos2010c,Ivlev2015,Papadopoulos2018}).$
$\subsection{Variations of the \CI/\CO line ratio (\RCICO) in the literature}$
$Although the spatial distributions of \CI  and low-J CO emission resemble each other surprisingly well from molecular clouds to Galactic scales (e.g., across the Galactic plane; \citealt{Wright1991,Bennett1994,Oka2005,Burton2015}) and in external galaxies with spatially resolved observations (e.g., \citealt{Schilke1993,White1994b,Harrison1995,Israel1995,Israel2001,Israel2003,Zhang2014,Krips2016,Cicone2018,Crocker2019,Jiao2019,Miyamoto2018,Miyamoto2021,Salak2019,Izumi2020,Saito2020,Michiyama2020,Michiyama2021}),$
$their line intensity ratio, \Remark{RCI10CO10} = \Remark{ICI10} / \Remark{ICO10} \footnote{The line intensity I has brightness temperature units \mathrm{K km s^{-1}}.}, does vary according to local ISM conditions --- \CI  and CO fractional abundance (i.e., metallicity), excitation condition (e.g., excitation temperature T_{\mathrm{ex}} and optical depth \tau), and UV and/or CR radiation field.$
$At individual molecular cloud scales, \Remark{RCI10CO10} (or column density ratio) seems to vary from \gtrsim 0.5 (or \gtrsim 0.2 for column density ratio) to <0.1 with an increasing N_{\mathrm{H2}} and A_V, e.g., from cloud surface or PDR front to the interior \citep[e.g.][]{Frerking1982,Genzel1988,Oka2004,Kramer2004,Kramer2008,Mookerjea2006,Sun2008,Yamagishi2021}.$
$At sub-galactic scales, when individual clouds are smoothed out, \Remark{RCI10CO10} is found to lie in a narrower range of \sim 0.1 \text{--} 0.3. For example, across the Galactic plane, the ratio is found to change only slightly within a galactocentric radius of 3--7~kpc (\sim 0.08 \text{--} 0.12, overall mean = 0.105 \pm 0.004; \citealt{Oka2005});$
$whereas in the starburst galaxies like M~82 and NGC~253, \Remark{RCI10CO10} or the [\CI]/CO abundance ratio is a factor of 3--5 higher than the Galactic value (\citealt{Schilke1993,White1994b,Krips2016}).$
$Recent high-resolution (hundred pc scales) \Remark{CI10} mapping studies in the nearby spiral galaxy M~83 (\citealt{Miyamoto2021}) and starburst galaxy IRAS~F18293-3413 (\citealt{Saito2020}) reported tightly-correlated \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO10} emission, with scaling relations at hundred parsecs equivalent to$
$\Remark{RCI10CO10} = 0.14 \times (L^{\prime}_{\Remark{CO10}}/10^{6.0} [\Remark{Kkmspc2}])^{-0.13}$
$and$
$\Remark{RCI10CO10} = 0.21 \times (L^{\prime}_{\Remark{CO10}}/10^{6.8} [\Remark{Kkmspc2}])^{+0.54},$
$respectively.$
$The discrepant power-law indices reflects different trends in individual galaxies that are not fully understood.$
$Meanwhile, in the central \lesssim 100~pc of NGC~7469 close to the X-ray-luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN), \RCICO  is found to be substantially enhanced by a factor of >10 (reaching \Remark{RCI10CO10} \approx 1; \citealt{Izumi2020}; see also the Circinus Galaxy's AGN with \Remark{RCI10CO32} \approx 0.9 in \citealt{Izumi2018}).$
$Furthermore, in the low-metallicity Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) environments, a factor of 1.5 - 3 \times higher \RCICO  values have been found (\citealt{Bolatto2000b,Bolatto2000c}; see also other low-metallicity galaxies: \citealt{Bolatto2000a,Hunt2017}).$
$These studies indicate that \RCICO  is sensitive to ISM conditions among and within galaxies.$
$However, previous extragalactic studies are mainly focused on starburst galaxies and bright galaxy centres. How \RCICO  behaves across the disks and spiral arms of typical star-forming galaxies is much less explored. Whether \CI  can trace the so-called CO-dark molecular gas at a low gas density or metallicity is also still in question.$
$Understanding \RCICO  variation and quantifying the \CI  and \CO  excitation in extragalactic environments is now particularly important given the rapidly growing numbers and diverse galactic environments of \CI  line observations at cosmological distances (e.g., \citealt{Weiss2003,Weiss2005,Pety2004,Wagg2006,Walter2011,Danielson2011,AlaghbandZadeh2013,Gullberg2016,Bothwell2017,Popping2017,Yang2017,Emonts2018,Valentino2018,Valentino2020,Bourne2019,Nesvadba2019,Dannerbauer2019,Jin2019,Brisbin2019,Boogaard2020,Cortzen2020,Harrington2021,Dunne2021,Lee2021}).$
$\subsection{What drives \RCICO? --- the need for high-resolution mapping across wide galactic environments}$
$High-resolution mapping of \CI  and CO from disks and spiral arms of nearby galaxies is indispensable for understanding and quantifying the ISM \CI  and CO physics. In particular, the following questions will be answered only with such observations:$
$Do \CI  and low-J CO have the same spatial distributions across galaxy disks?$
$Does the \RCICO  line ratio vary significantly across galaxy disks?$
$How does the \RCICO  line ratio vary among different local galaxies?$
$How can the observed \RCICO  line ratio be reliably converted to the \CI  and CO column density ratio (i.e., solving their radiation transfer equations and level population statistics and obtaining optical depths and excitation temperature)?$
$Currently, high-resolution (hundreds of parsec scale) imaging/mapping of \CI  in nearby galaxies relies on radio telescopes at high altitudes, e.g., the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE, 10-m single-dish), Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX, 12-m single-dish), and is limited to the available weather conditions corresponding to the high frequency of \CI  lines. Therefore, only a handful of galaxies have been imaged/mapped.$
$These include NGC~6240 by \citet{Cicone2018}, Circinus Galaxy by \citet{Izumi2018}, NGC~613 by \citet{Miyamoto2018}, NGC~1808 by \citet{Salak2019}, NGC~7469 by \citet{Izumi2020}, IRAS~F18293-3413 by \citet{Saito2020}, NGC~6052 by \citet[][\CI  undetected]{Michiyama2020}, 36 (U)LIRGs by \citet{Michiyama2021}, M~83 by \citet[][mapped the centre and northern part with ASTE]{Miyamoto2021}, Arp~220 by \citet{Ueda2022}, and NGC~1068 by \citet{Saito2022a,Saito2022b}.$
$Nevertheless, all of these observations, except for M~83, targeted the centres of starburst, IR-luminous and/or AGN host galaxies. M~83 is the only typical star-forming main sequence galaxy having a high-quality \CI  mapping. However, its map is still limited to a quarter of its inner \sim3~kpc disk.$
$In this work, we present two new \CI  mapping observations with the ALMA Atacama Compact Array (or Morita Array; 7-m dish, hereafter ACA or 7m) in nearby spiral galaxies NGC~3627 and NGC~4321.$
$Our observations aimed at detecting \CI  in the disks, and thus are much larger-area and deeper than previous \CI  maps.$
$By further adding a starburst and an AGN-host galaxy from the literature into our analysis, we present a comprehensive study of the \Remark{RCI10CO21} line ratio (hereafter \RCICO; ratios of other \CI /CO transitions will be explicitly written otherwise) in nearby star-forming disk and starburst and AGN environments.$
$In order to quantify the \CI  and CO abundance ratio,$
$we have further calculated the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE radiative transfer of \CI  and CO under several \textit{representative ISM conditions}.$
$The results from this study could thus be one of the most comprehensive local benchmarks for understanding the \CI  and CO line ratio and abundance variations.$
$The paper, as the first one of our series of papers, is organized as follows.$
$Sect.~\ref{sec: Observations} describes the sample selection, observations and data reduction.$
$Sect.~\ref{sec: Results} presents the spatial distribution and variation of \RCICO.$
$Sect.~\ref{sec: Excitation Analysis} presents the analysis of \CI  and CO excitation and radiative transfer and thus the abundance (species column density) ratio.$
$In Sect.~\ref{sec: Discussion} we discuss various topics relating to the [\CI/CO] abundance variation, CRDR, XDR, and CO-dark gas.$
$Finally we conclude in Sect.~\ref{sec: Conclusion}.$
$Our companion paper~II (D. Liu et al. in prep.) presents the detailed radiative transfer calculation and \CI  and CO conversion factors, and is related to the abundance calculation in this paper.$

$\section{Targets and observations}$
$\label{sec: Observations}$
$\subsection{Target selection}$
$\label{subsection: Target Selection}$
$Our targets, NGC~3627 and NGC~4321, are selected from a joint sample of the PHANGS-ALMA CO(2--1) (\citealt{Leroy2021phangs}), PHANGS-HST (\citealt{PHANGSHST}), and PHANGS-MUSE (\citealt{PHANGSMUSE}) surveys, with CO line intensities and systemic velocities best suitable for ALMA Band 8 \CI  mapping.$
$The PHANGS-ALMA sample consists of 90 nearby star-forming galaxies initially selected at distances of 2 \lesssim d / \mathrm{Mpc} \lesssim 23, with a stellar mass \log (M_{\star}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}) > 9.75, and which are not too inclined and visible to ALMA. They represent the typical star-forming main sequence galaxies in the local Universe.$
$The PHANGS-HST sample \citep{PHANGSHST} is a subsample of 38 PHANGS-ALMA galaxies, providing high-resolution stellar properties.$
$The PHANGS-MUSE large program \citep{PHANGSMUSE} targeted a subsample of 19 PHANGS-ALMA galaxies suitable for VLT/MUSE optical integral field unit (IFU) observations, achieving similar spatial coverage as in PHANGS-ALMA and providing rich nebular emission lines, attenuation, stellar age and metallicity and H~\textsc{ii} region information (e.g., \citealt{Kreckel2019, Kreckel2020, Pessa2021, Santoro2021, Williams2022}).$
$For the legacy value, we selected our sample from the joint ALMA+MUSE+HST sample pool, considered CO surface brightness, mapping area, \CI  line frequency and the transmission in the ALMA Band 8.$
$In this work, we present the new \CI  data of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321.$
$Because of the ALMA Band 8 sensitivity and the expected fainter \CI  line intensity than CO, the \CI  mapping areas are smaller than their CO(2--1) maps, but they are still the largest (\sim1'-2.35') and deepest (rms~\sim0.04~K per \sim5~km~s^{-1}) \CI  mapping with ALMA.$
$Furthermore, in order to study the \CI  and CO in different galactic environments, we selected two starbursting and/or AGN-host galaxies from the literature whose ALMA \Remark{CI10} and CO(2--1) data are available in the archive: NGC~1808 \citep{Salak2019} and NGC~7469 \citep{Izumi2020}.$
$NGC~1808 has ALMA mosaic observations covering its \sim 1~kpc starburst ring, and NGC~7469 has ALMA single-pointing observations covering its inner \sim 3~kpc area.$
$\subsection{New ALMA ACA Band 8 observations}$
$\label{subsection: ALMA Band 8 Observation}$
$Our \CI  observations for NGC~3627 were taken under the ALMA project 2018.1.01290.S (PI: D. Liu) during June 3rd to Sept. 29th, 2019 with ACA-only at Band~8. The total on-source integration time was 30.8~hours. A mosaic with 149 pointings was used to map an area of 94" \times 136" at a position angle of -27^\circ, which covers the galaxy centre, bar and the majority of the spiral arms, and is about 1/3 of the full PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) map area.$
$The achieved line sensitivity per 5 \kms is 45--55~mK (107--130~\mathrm{mJy/beam}) across the \Remark{CI10} line frequencies with a beam of 3.46".$
$The \CI  mapping for NGC~4321 were taken under the ALMA project 2019.1.01635.S (PI: D. Liu; NGC~1365 is also partially observed for this project) during Dec. 3rd, 2019 to July 1st, 2021, also with ACA-only at Band~8. The on-source integration time reached 16.1~hours for the mapping of an area of 55" \times 42" with 23 pointings using the 7m array. The achieved line sensitivity is similar to that of NGC~3627.$
$More detailed information is newd in Table~\ref{table: targets}.$
$ACA (7m) was chosen to new a matched and slightly coarser synthesized beam (\sim 3"-4") than the PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) data. In comparison, the main 12m ALMA array in compact C43-1/2 configurations will result in a \sim 0.4"-0.7" beam and significantly miss large scale (>4-6") emission without ACA.$
$No total power observations were requested in our presented observation, therefore we matched the uv ranges of the raw CO(2--1) and \Remark{CI10} visibility data during our data reduction.$
$We verified that missing flux will not substantially (\sim 30\%) bias our analysis using three methods as detailed in Appendix~\ref{appendix: missing flux}. This includes a CASA simulation of visibilities mimicking our ACA mosaic observations in NGC~3627, from which we find a missing flux as small as 7\% in \CI-bright pixels and up to \sim 50\% in the faintest pixels (and mostly < 30\%).$
$Our data reduction follows the PHANGS-ALMA imaging and post-processing pipeline \citep[][]{Leroy2021pipeline}, including imaging and deconvolution, mosaicking, broad and strict/signal mask generation, and moment map creation.$
$The additional steps in this study are: (a) uv-clipping in the CO(2--1) data to match the uv sampling range of \Remark{CI10}; and (b) making a joint mask of the individual CO(2--1) and \Remark{CI10} masks then extracting the moment maps (in the joint broad mask) and line ratios maps (in the joint strict mask).$
$More technical details are newd in Appendix~\ref{appendix: data reduction}.$
$Our \Remark{CI10} and CO(2--1) line intensity maps, the line ratio maps and \textit{HST} images for the two PHANGS galaxies, NGC~3627 and NGC~4321, are presented in Figs.~\ref{fig: NGC3627 line ratio map} and \ref{fig: NGC4321 line ratio map}, respectively.$

$\subsection{ALMA observations of the additional targets from the literature}$
$\label{subsection: additional targets}$
$The NGC~1808 ALMA \Remark{CI10}, \Remark{CO10} and \Remark{CO21} observations are presented in \citet{Salak2019} and all are interferometry plus total power, i.e., 12m+7m+tp, thus having no missing flux issue.$
$To study the \CI /\CO  line ratio consistently with our main targets, we only used the \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO21} data.$
$We re-reduced the raw data under ALMA project 2017.1.00984.S (PI: D. Salak) with the observatory calibration pipeline, then imaged, primary-beam-corrected and short-spacing-corrected using the PHANGS-ALMA pipeline in the same way as for our main targets (Appendix~\ref{appendix: data reduction}).$
$Note that in this step we re-reduced and imaged the total power data with the PHANGS-ALMA singledish pipeline (\citealt{Herrera2020,Leroy2021pipeline}) and did the short-spacing correction with the PHANGS-ALMA pipeline right after the primary beam correction.$
$The properties of the final \CO -\CI  beam-matched data cubes are listed in Table~\ref{table: targets}.$
$The NGC~7469 ALMA data are presented in \citet{Izumi2020} and we used the archival raw data of \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO21} under ALMA project 2017.1.00078.S (PI: T. Izumi). These are single pointings toward the centre. \Remark{CI10} is observed with ACA 7m and \Remark{CO21} with the 12m array, both without total power. We re-reduced the data following the same procedure as for NGC~3627 and NGC~4321 with the PHANGS-ALMA pipeline.$
$Our re-reduced \Remark{CI10} and CO(2--1) line intensity and ratio maps for these additional galaxies are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig: other line ratio maps}.$

$\subsection{Spatial distributions}$
$In Figs.~\ref{fig: NGC3627 line ratio map}, \ref{fig: NGC4321 line ratio map} and \ref{fig: other line ratio maps}, we present the beam-matched \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO21} integrated line intensity maps and their ratio maps.$
$The \CI/\CO  line ratio map is computed only for pixels within the joint strict mask area of the two lines, as described in Appendix~\ref{appendix: data reduction}, representing high-confidence signals.$
$In NGC~3627 (Fig.~\ref{fig: NGC3627 line ratio map}), we visually marked 23 regions based on the \CI  and CO commonly-detected (\mathrm{S/N}>3), strict-mask areas for later analysis. Region IDs are sorted by their \Remark{CI10} brightness.$
$Region 1 corresponds to the galaxy centre, Regions 2 and 3 are the southern and northern bar ends, Region 4 is an offset peak next to the galaxy centre, and other regions are mostly on the spiral arms. Most of these regions show a similar \RCICO \sim 0.1, except for, e.g., Regions 20 and 22 which exhibit a somewhat higher ratio of \RCICO \sim 0.5. The edge of Region 4 also shows an enhancement of \CI  yet it is hard to tell whether this is physical or simply caused by edge effects, e.g., as seen in our simulations (Appendix~\ref{appendix: simulation}).$
$We also examined the integrated spectra of each region in Appendix~\ref{appendix: all regions}.$
$The \CI  and CO line profiles are not always well-matched in width and shape. In the galaxy centre (Region 1) and at bright bar-ends (Regions 2, 3, 5), \CI  and CO have similar line widths but \CI  has a lower intensity than CO, whereas in some fainter regions (9, 10, 13, 14), \CI  is narrower than CO and relatively weaker. In Regions 4, 20 and 22 where \RCICO is high, \CI  and CO have similar line widths but the \CI  intensity is enhanced.$
$In NGC~4321 (Fig.~\ref{fig: NGC4321 line ratio map}), we mapped a smaller area due to its fainter CO brightness than NGC~3627. There are no regions with \Remark{CO21} integrated intensities >100  \Kkms outside our selected area in NGC~4321, whereas in comparison the NGC~3627 bar ends have \Remark{CO21} integrated intensities \gtrsim 300  \Kkms. The \CI  mapping in NGC~4321 has a similar depth as in NGC~3627.$
$We marked 7 regions in NGC~4321 to guide the visual inspection. A clear \RCICO  newcommandicit can be seen in the galaxy centre (Region 1), with \RCICO \sim 0.06, nearly a factor of two smaller than its inner disk which has similar \RCICO \sim 0.1 as seen in the NGC~3627 disk. Some \CI  enhancement can be found at the edges or slightly outside these regions, where CO and \CI  are both faint (\Remark{ICO21} \sim 30-100  \Kkms) and the edge effect of interferometric missing flux might play a role (see Appendix~\ref{appendix: simulation}).$
$The \RCICO  spatial distributions of the other two starburst/AGN galaxies (Fig.~\ref{fig: other line ratio maps}) show in general more enhanced \RCICO  than in the NGC~3627 and NGC~4321 disks.$
$Large variations from the centres to outer areas can be seen, especially at the the S/N threshold of \sim 3 \text{--} 5 (see contours).$
$To quantify the spatial co-localization of the \CI  and CO emission, we use the \incode{JACoP} tool \citep{JACoP} \footnote{\url{https://imagej.net/plugins/jacop}}$
$in the \incode{ImageJ} software \citep{ImageJ} to measure the commonly used co-localization indicators, namely the Pearson's coefficient (PC; equal to 0 and 1 for null and 100\% localization, respectively) and Manders' coefficients (M1 and M2; which measure the overlap between two images and are equal to one for perfect overlap). We turn on the option of using Costes' automatic threshold \citep{Costes2004} which automatically set a pixel value threshold for each image to minimize the contribution of noise for the comparison \citep{JACoP}.$
$For the \CI  and CO emission in our galaxies, we find \mathrm{PC/M1/M2} values all very close to 1, that is, nearly 100\% co-localization (\mathrm{PC/M1/M2} = 0.934/0.985/0.990 for NGC~3627, 0.816/0.986/0.964 for NGC~4321, 0.978/0.890/0.906 for NGC~1808, and 0.935/0.999/0.998 for NGC~7469).$
$Overall, the spatial comparison of the \CI  and CO intensities demonstrates that the two species are well-correlated when observed at hundred parsec scales.$
$Meanwhile, we do see certain spectral differences in the line profiles as shown in Appendix~\ref{appendix: all regions}. This may suggest that variations exist at smaller scales than our resolution, which could be the sign of different evolutionary stages \citep[e.g.][]{Kruijssen2014} and would be interesting for higher-resolution follow-ups, e.g., with the main ALMA 12m array.$

$In Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO} we show the scatter points of \CI  and CO line brightnesses and the \RCICO  line ratios.$
$Systematic differences in \RCICO can be found among these galaxies and within their galactic environments. We discuss these environments separately as follows.$
$\subsubsection{Star-forming and starburst disk environments}$
$The majority of molecular gas in the 3--7~kpc star-forming disks of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321 exhibits a tight distribution of \RCICO around 0.1 (within about \pm50\%). The distribution is fairly flat over an order of magnitude in \Remark{ICO21}. We denote this as the "SF disk" regime.$
$The ratio rises to about 0.2 within a galactocentric radius of few hundred parsec to \sim 1~kpc starburst areas in NGC~1808 and NGC~7469, which we newcommandine as the "SB disk" regime.$
$The nearly flat "SB disk" distribution is consistent with earlier studies. \citet{Salak2019} found that in NGC~1808 \Remark{ICI10} is proportional to \Remark{ICO21}^{ +1.05}. They also studied CO(1--0), finding that \Remark{ICI10} \propto \Remark{ICO10}^{ +1.46}, i.e., with a steeper slope.$
$\citet{Saito2020} found a similar slope between \Remark{ICI10} and \Remark{ICO10}: \Remark{ICI10} \propto \Remark{ICO10}^{ +1.54} in IRAS~F18293-3413 (whose CO(2--1) data is insufficient for such a study as previously mentioned).$
$This correlation slope is likely to change with different CO transitions due to the CO excitation's dependence on the CO luminosity or star formation rate themselves (e.g., \citealt{Daddi2015,Liudz2021a}).$
$For higher-J CO transitions, \citet{Michiyama2021} studied \CI  and CO(4--3) lines in 36 (U)LIRGs, finding \Remark{ICI10} \propto \Remark{ICO43}^{ +0.97}.$
$The upward tails seen at the CO-faint-end in the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO} are mostly due to the detection limits in each galaxy. The color shading indicates the 5-\sigma limit for each galaxy, assuming a typical line width of 10~km~s^{-1}. Region~22 of NGC~3627 and the outer pixels in the two starburst/AGN galaxies make the tips of the blue and gray faint-end tails, respectively. But most of these features should still be spurious. We performed CASA simulations following the real observations of NGC~3627 to verify what we would get if \RCICO  were constant across the galaxies (Appendix~\ref{appendix: simulation})$
$We find that noise can indeed boost a simulated \RCICO  of 0.2 to a measurement as high as 0.5 in a NGC~3627-like large mosaic, or even higher to >1 in single-pointing ALMA data without total power or sufficient short spacing. However, the faint-end tail from the simulation is not very similar to that of NGC~3627, raising some questions about the nature of the high-\RCICO  in Region~22.$
$Furthermore, we also did stacking experiments using the CO line profile as the prior to measure the \CI  line fluxes in bins of CO line brightnesses or galactocentric radii. We find no systematically higher \RCICO  at fainter CO pixels or at the outer radii.$
$\subsubsection{Galaxy centre environments}$
$Most interestingly, the \lesssim 250~pc centres of all four galaxies show dramatically different \RCICO. It varies by a factor of ten from \sim 0.05 in the centre of NGC~4321  to \sim 0.1 in the centre of NGC~3627, then to \sim 0.15--0.2 at the centre of NGC~1808, and to \sim 0.2--0.5 in the nucleus of NGC~7469.$
$This "nuclei" trend has a slope of about 0.8, i.e., \Remark{ICI10} \approx 0.035 \; \Remark{ICO21}^{ +0.8}, and corresponds to a \Sigmol range of about 10^{3} to 10^{4} \; \Mspc2 if adopting an \alphaCO = 4.3  \mathrm{M_{\odot} \; (K   km   s^{-1}   pc^2)^{-1}} (\citealt{Bolatto2013}) and a CO excitation R_{21} = 0.65 (\citealt{Leroy2021c}).$
$The reasons for the nuclei showing this trend likely include both the effect of varying [\CI/CO] abundance ratio and the excitation and radiative transfer. They are determined by the actual ISM conditions in each environment, i.e., the gas kinetic temperature, \CI  and CO column densities (\CIcolumndensity and \COcolumndensity), line widths (\Delta{v}), and \mathrm{H_2} volume density (\nHtwo), etc.$
$They will be analyzed in Sect.~\ref{sec: Excitation Analysis}.$
$\subsubsection{Histogram and curve-of-growth of the line ratio distributions}$
$Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio histogram} shows the histogram and cumulative distribution functions of \RCICO (left panel) and the mean \RCICO and the 16-th to 84-th percentiles in bins of CO line intensity (right panel) in our galaxies.$
$The histogram is computed as the sum of CO line intensity in each bin of \RCICO, representing the amount of gas at each \RCICO.$
$The NGC~4321 histogram is lower than others, showing that it has the least total molecular gas mass among the four galaxies within mapped areas. The NGC~3627 histogram has a peak about 0.5~dex higher than that of NGC~4321, but their peak locations are consistently at \log \RCICO \sim -1, same conclusion as our previous scatter plots show.$
$The two SB galaxies NGC~1808 and NGC~7469, despite having much smaller observed areas (\sim 1--2~kpc), have more than an order of magnitude higher peaks hence total molecular gas masses.$
$The locations of their histogram peaks also shift to a systematically higher \RCICO.$
$It is clearly seen that both SF and SB disks lack a high-\RCICO (\log \RCICO > -0.35) gas component which dominates the gas in the strong AGN host galaxy NGC~7469.$
$The curve-of-growth in the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio histogram} further shows the cumulative CO brightness in bins of \RCICO, and reflects the fact that the majority of gas in our galactic disks has a narrow distribution of \RCICO (see also last few rows in Table~\ref{table: targets}).$
$In NGC~3627, NGC~4321 and NGC~1808, the higher- and lower-\RCICO gas outside \pm 0.1~dex around the mean \RCICO only sums up to <5--10\% of their total gas masses.$
$In the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio histogram}, we illustrate how the mean \RCICO changes with different gas surface density, as well as the scatter of the data point distribution. The 2D pixels are binned by CO brightness, and the mean and 16\%/50\%/84\%-th percentiles of the \RCICO are computed for each bin.$
$It sketches out the mean trends in Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO} (right panel), and also reveals that$
$a) the scatter of \RCICO is the largest (\pm 0.20~dex) in the starburst disk of NGC~7469 compared to other galaxies;$
$b) the scatter is the smallest (\pm 0.06~dex) in the star-forming disks of NGC~4321 and NGC~3627 where \Sigmol \sim 100 \text{--} 500 \; \Mspc2;$
$c) the scatters are very similarly (\pm 0.10~dex) at a relatively high \Sigmol \sim 1000 \; \Mspc2 in all our galaxies except for NGC~4321's centre.$

$    Line ratio versus mean ISRF intensity \Umean measured from SED fitting to the near- to far-IR (\textit{Spitzer}, \textit{Herschel}) data.$
$    \textit{Left four panels} are the \Umean maps of NGC~3627, NGC~4321, NGC~1808 and NGC~7469, and as described in Sect.~\ref{subsection: ISRF} are obtained from the works done by J. Chastenet et al. (in prep.) as a continued effort of \citet{Chastenet2021}.$
$    \textit{Right panel} shows the scatter plot of \RCICO versus \Umean at a spatial resolution of \sim 18" in the manually-selected apertures shown in the left panels.$
$    We computed a beam-weighted mean \RCICO and a centre pixel \RCICO for each aperture, displayed as the solid and open symbols, respectively.$
$    Error bars are the corresponding beam-weighted mean or central pixel \RCICO  uncertainties in each region.$
$    The region diameter (\sim 18") corresponds to the coarsest resolution of the \textit{Herschel} data used in the SED fitting.$
$    The gray dotted line shows \RCICO = 0.07   U^{0.25} as a guiding line.$
$    The colored dotted contours (labeled 0.1--0.5) are the model contours of \RCICO computed from the PDR Toolbox (using the latest \incode{wk2020} model and solar metallicity; \citealt{Kaufman2006}). We convert G_0 from the model contour to the x-axis U by multiplying with a factor of 0.88 (\citealt{Draine2007}).$
$    The right y-axis indicates the PDR model's \nHtwo, whose range is manually adjusted so that the model contours roughly match the left x-axis.$
$    The PDR model contours show little dependence of \RCICO on U in the horizontal direction but a strong correlation with \nHtwo as seen by the vertical gradient.$
$\label{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}$
$}\vspace{1ex}$
$\end{figure*}$
$Here we study how \RCICO  correlates with the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) intensity (U; in units of Milky Way mean ISRF; \citealt{Habing1968}), which is a measure of the UV radiation field strength impacting the ISM. Since \CI  originates from PDRs, its abundance should be highly related to the PDR properties, thus whether or how \RCICO  correlates with the ISRF that illuminates the PDR is a key question.$
$The ISRF intensity U is usually measured by the re-radiated dust emission, as the original UV photons are highly attenuated by dust in the ISM. \citet[][hereafter DL07]{DL07} developed a series of dust grain models and synthesized SED templates that can describe nearby galaxies' observed dust SEDs. A number of studies (e.g., \citealt{Draine2007,Galliano2011,Dale2012,Aniano2012,Aniano2020,Daddi2015,Chastenet2017,Liudz2021a,Chastenet2021}) have used the DL07 models to fit the dust SEDs of galaxies near and far.$
$For our study, we adopt the mass-averaged ISRF \Umean maps from an ongoing effort by J. Chastenet et al. (in prep.) which is a continuation of the work published for other galaxies by \citet{Chastenet2017,Chastenet2021} with the same method.$
$In this method, the \textit{Herschel} far-infrared, \textit{Spitzer} and/or \textit{WISE} near-infrared images \footnote{For the two (U)LIRGs, the WISE maps are saturated, so their inferred ISRF intensity U should be considered with a large uncertainty.} are first PSF-matched to a common resolution \sim 18" (\textit{Herschel} SPIRE 250\mum), then SED fitting is performed using the DL07 models at each pixel.$
$Each dust SED is fitted by two dust components, one in the ambient ISM with a constant ISRF intensity U_{\mathrm{min}}, and the other in regions with higher U with a power law distributed ISRF from U_{\mathrm{min}} up to U_{\mathrm{max}} = 10^{7}.$
$The fitting then gives the best-fit U_{\mathrm{min}} and the power-law index \gamma of the U distribution.$
$The mean ISRF intensity \Umean is calculated as the dust mass-weighted mean of the ambient and power-law ISRF intensities (in DL07, U_{\rm PDR} \ge 10^2 is considered to be associated with the PDR), and better represents the overall ISRF than U_{\mathrm{min}}.$
$Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF} presents the \Umean maps and the \RCICO  versus \Umean scatter plot. Since the spatial resolution of the \Umean maps is 18", we calculate a weighted \RCICO in each circular aperture shown in Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF} whose diameter equals the \Umean map resolution, with weighting following the 2D Gaussian beam.$
$In addition, we also show the central pixel value for each region in Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}.$
$We restrict the analysis to regions where both \Umean and \RCICO  are measured.$
$A weak correlation between \RCICO  and \Umean is seen from the SF to SB disks, with a large scatter. For reference, we plot a \RCICO = 0.07   U^{0.25} line to indicate this weak trend. The lowest-\Umean data point in NGC~3627 (mainly Region~22) and the centre of NGC~7469 do not follow this trend, possibly indicating other \CI  enhancement mechanisms than \Umean.$
$We use the popular PDR modelling software, PDR Toolbox (version 2.2.9; \citealt{Kaufman2006,Pound2008,pdrtoolbox}) \footnote{\url{https://dustem.astro.umd.edu/}; \url{https://github.com/mpound/pdrtpy}.}$
$to compute the theoretical \RCICO in uniform grids of ISRF intensity in the \citet{Habing1968} G_0 unit and H nucleus density n_{\mathrm{H}} (both in log space). We adopt the latest \incode{wk2020} model set and a solar metallicity (\mathrm{[O/H_2]} = 3.2 \times 10^{-4}, \mathrm{[C/H_2]} = 1.6 \times 10^{-4}).$
$The ISRF intensity grid can be directly scaled to U by multiplying a factor 0.88 (\citealt{Draine2007}), corresponding to the x-axis of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}.$
$The n_{\mathrm{H}} grid is not directly linked to the left y-axis of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}, but because the model contours show fairly flat \RCICO versus U trends, we can match the model contours and indicate the n_{\mathrm{H}} grid in the right y-axis of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}.$
$The PDR modelling predicts generally flat \RCICO versus U trends similar to the distribution of the observed data points, although our U are diluted values at a much larger physical scale than in the PDR models.$
$However, in PDR models, \RCICO  changes moderately with n_{\mathrm{H}}, and a relatively high n_{\mathrm{H}} \sim 10^{3.5\text{--}3.7}   \mathrm{cm^{-3}} is needed to reproduce an \RCICO \sim 0.1--0.2, or equivalently \sim 1.0--1.9 for the ratio of \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO21} fluxes in \mathrm{erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} sr^{-1}} units used by the PDR Toolbox \footnote{See \url{https://github.com/mpound/pdrtpy-nb/blob/master/notebooks/PDRT_Example_Model_Plotting.ipynb}.$
$We scale the ratio of intensities in \mathrm{erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} sr^{-1}} to the ratio of intensities in \mathrm{K km s^{-1}} by a factor of (\nu_{\mathrm{CI10}}/\nu_{\mathrm{CO21}})^{-3} = 9.73, where \nu is the rest-frame frequency of the lines. We caution that the old version of \incode{PDRToolbox} \incode{v2.1.1} does not include the \incode{CI_609/CO_21} line ratio, but has \incode{CI_609/CO_43} and \incode{CO_43/CO_21} ratios. However, we tested that the multiplication of \incode{CI_609/CO_43} and \incode{CO_43/CO_21} does not produce the same result as the direct \incode{CI_609/CO_21} ratio in the new \incode{PDRToolbox} \incode{v2.2.9}. We use the new version for this work.$
$}.$
$Furthermore, the PDR model needs a \sim0.5~dex lower n_{\mathrm{H}} to explain the 2\times elevated \RCICO  in SB disks, which seems somewhat counterintuitive.$
$This apparent tension is likely caused by the observations probing a much coarser resolution that consists of a large number of PDRs with different n_{\mathrm{H}} and U (e.g., increasing U from 10 to 400 can increase \RCICO from 0.2 to 0.5 based on our PDR Toolbox modelling). It may also relate to an abundance variation driven by non-PDR mechanisms ---$
$X-ray dominated region (XDR; \citealt{Maloney1996,Meijerink2005,Meijerink2007}; see also review by \citealt{Wolfire2022}) and Cosmic Ray Dominated Region (CRDR; \citealt{Papadopoulos2010c,Papadopoulos2011,Papadopoulos2018,Bisbas2015,Bisbas2017}) are well-known to play an important role in starbursting and AGN environments, respectively.$

$As pointed out by \citet{Papadopoulos2011} and later works, ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with IR luminosities L_{\mathrm{IR, 8-1000\mu\mathrm{m}}} \ge 10^{12}   \Lsun and corresponding \mathrm{SFRs} > 1000   \Msyr have cosmic-ray (CR) energy densities \sim 10^{3} \text{--} 10^{4}\times larger than the Milky Way. In our sample, the two SB galaxies are not as intensively star-forming as ULIRGs, but their SFRs are still a factor of 2 to 20 higher than our SF galaxies. More importantly, the SB disks have considerably higher (e.g., one to two orders of magnitude) SFR surface densities than the SF disks, plausibly leading to a factor of a few tens to hundreds higher CR intensities. The CRs emitted from OB star clusters and supernova remnants can penetrate deeply into the ISM, and thus nearly uniformly illuminate the ISM and effectively dissociate CO into \CI .$
$A detailed simulation by \citet{Bisbas2017} showed that 10\times and 100\times higher CR ionization rates (\xi_{\mathrm{CR}}) than the Milky Way level results into a factor of about 2 and 3 mildly-increased \CI  abundance and about 1/2 and 1/30 strongly-decreased CO abundance, respectively (see their Fig.~3), in a 10~pc GMC with a mean gas density \left<n_{\mathrm{H}} \right>= 760   \mathrm{cm^{-3}}, resembling Milky Way and typical SF galaxies' ISM conditions.$
$Our SB galaxies probably have a \xi_{\mathrm{CR}} around or slightly above 10, but not reaching 100 given their mild \Umean \sim 20-30 compared to the \Umean \gtrsim 50 in extreme SB galaxies, e.g., local ULIRGs and high-redshift hyperluminous IR-bright (HyLIRG) and submm galaxies (\citealt{Daddi2015,Silverman2018,Liudz2021a}).$
$In Sect.~\ref{sec: Excitation Analysis}, we show that the mildly-increased [\CI/CO] abundance ratio from a CRDR and temperature/density-driven excitation can lead to the factor of 2 increase in \RCICO  when going from SF to SB disks.$
$\subsection{\RCICO versus Metallicity}$
$\label{subsec: metallicity}$
$Our current sample covers a relatively small range in metallicity for a metallicity--line ratio study. Given their stellar masses and metallicity maps (e.g., \citealt{Kreckel2019,Kreckel2020,Williams2022}), our targets probe a near-solar metallicity. NGC~3627 has a well-measured$
$metallicity gradient of Z = 8.53 + 0.06 \times[r/R_{25}] from \citet{Kreckel2019} \footnote{\citet{Kreckel2019} used a distance of 10.6 \pm 0.9 \; \mathrm{Mpc} for NGC~3627. We do not directly use this metallicity gradient, but use the metallicity maps from \citet{Williams2022} where the same new distance as in this work is adopted.}, but the metallicity of individual \ionizedhydrogen  regions scatter between \sim 8.45--8.65.$
$\citet{Williams2022} produced the 2D spatial distributions of gas-phase metallicity in PHANGS-MUSE galaxies, including NGC~3627 and NGC~4321, by applying the Gaussian Process Regression to map the smooth, higher-order metallicity variation from the individual, sparse \ionizedhydrogen  regions detected in PHANGS-MUSE (\citealt{PHANGSMUSE, Santoro2021}).$
$This method is significantly superior to a naïve nearest neighbor interpolation method. We refer the reader to \citet{Williams2022} for the technical details and validation demonstration.$
$In Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs metallicity} we present the trend between \RCICO  and metallicity in NGC~3627 and NGC~4321.$
$Due to our limited metallicity range, only a very weak decreasing trend can be seen.$
$A similar trend has been reported by \citet{Bolatto2000b}, who observed CO(1--0) and \Remark{CI10} in the Region N27 of the Small Magellanic Cloud and combined with literature data to present a correlation between \RCICO  and metallicity over \sim 0.2 \text{--} 2   Z_{\odot}.$
$We overlay the \citet{Bolatto2000b} empirical fitting \footnote{$
$We adopt the equation from \citep[][Fig.~2 caption]{Bolatto2000b}, with a typo-correction in the brackets so that the equations are:$
$\log ( F_{\Remark{CI10}} / F_{\Remark{CO10}} ) = -0.47   \left[12 + \log \mathrm{(O/H)} \right]+ 5.0 and \log ( F_{\Remark{CI10}} / F_{\Remark{CO10}} ) = -0.82   \left[12 + \log \mathrm{(O/H)} \right]+ 8.2, respectively, where F is the line flux in \mathrm{erg   s^{-1}   cm^{-2}   sr^{-1}}.$
$}$
$as well as a theoretical PDR model prediction line from \citet{Bolatto1999} in Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs metallicity}.$
$Although our data covers only a small metallicity range, it is encouraging to see the overall good agreement with the observationally-driven trend in \citet{Bolatto2000b}.$
$More detailed understanding of the deviation from PDR models will likely need more \CI  mapping in lower-metallicity galaxies.$

$\section{Estimation of abundance ratios under representative ISM conditions}$
$\label{sec: Excitation Analysis}$
$The observed \RCICO  depends on not only the \CI  and CO abundances (\COabundance  and \CIabundance ), but also the ISM conditions that determine the excitation (level population) and radiative transfer of the C atoms and CO molecules --- i.e., the gas kinetic temperature \Tkin, volume density of H_2 (\nHtwo; as the primary collision partners of C and CO), turbulent line width \dv, and the species' column densities \COcolumndensity and \CIcolumndensity.$
$The column density divided by the line width (N/\dv) further determines the optical depth \tau of each line.$
$In this work, having only a CO(2--1) and a \Remark{CI10} line is insufficient to numerically solve all the \Tkin, \nHtwo, \COcolumndensity/\dv, \COabundance  and \CIabundance . Therefore, we assume several \textit{representative ISM conditions} where \Tkin, \dv and \COabundance  are fixed to reasonable values, then solve the \COcolumndensity and \CIcolumndensity. We assume that \CI  and CO are spatially mixed at our resolution, i.e., they have the same filling factor. This is a relatively strong assumption and is likely not the real case, because although we see spatial co-localization at our \sim 200~pc resolutions, the spectral profiles of CO and \CI show discrepancies (Appendix~\ref{appendix: all regions}), indicating different underlying distributions at smaller scales. With the assumption of the same filling factor (and 3D distribution), the column density ratio \CIcolumndensity/\COcolumndensity equals the [\CI/CO] abundance ratio.$
$We perform both LTE and non-LTE calculations.$
$LTE assumes that all transitions are thermalized locally, and the level population follows Boltzmann statistics, so that each transition's excitation temperature T_{\mathrm{ex}} as newcommandined by the level population equals \Tkin (e.g., \citealt{Spitzer1998Book,Tielens2010Book,Draine2011Book}). The LTE assumption facilitates the computation as we do not need to solve the level population and thus \nHtwo is not used.$
$However, LTE is not easily reached in typical ISM conditions. Subthermalized lines need non-LTE calculations. The commonly adopted non-LTE approach is the Large Velocity Gradient (LVG; \citealt{Scoville1974,Goldreich1974}), where an escape fraction is used to facilitate the local radiation intensity calculation hence the detailed balance of radiative and collisional (de-)excitations.$
$We use RADEX (\citealt{RADEX}) to compute the non-LTE \CI  and CO line fluxes for each fixed parameter set (\Tkin, \nHtwo, \COcolumndensity, \CIcolumndensity, \dv), then study how [\CI/CO] determines the line flux ratio \RCICO.$
$We assume the following 7 representative ISM conditions:$
$\textit{(1)} inner Galactic GMCs,$
$\textit{(2)} NGC~3627/4321 disk GMCs,$
$\textit{(3)} NGC~3627 bar-end environments,$
$\textit{(4)} NGC~1808/7469 SB disk,$
$\textit{(5)} NGC~4321 centre,$
$\textit{(6)} NGC~3627 centre,$
$and \textit{(7)} NGC~7469 centre.$
$Conditions \textit{(1)}--\textit{(3)} correspond to the "SF disk" in Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO}, and condition \textit{(4)} represents the "SB disk".$
$The last three conditions are for the "nuclei".$
$Under each ISM condition, we set a fixed \Tkin (in units of K), \dv (in units of km~s^{-1}), \COabundance , and \Sigmol (in units of \Mspc2).$
$The adopted values are shown at the top of each panel in Figs.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO} and \ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO}.$
$Our choice of \Tkin considered multi-line measurements in the literature, e.g., \citet{Heyer2015} for Galactic GMC ISM condition, and \citet{Teng2022} for NGC~3627 nucleus, as well as typical values in simulations (e.g., \citealt{Offner2014,Glover2015,Glover2016,Clark2019,HuChiaYu2021a}).$
$Our \dv is based on the observed line width in the highest-resolution ALMA data, i.e., from the original PHANGS-ALMA 1" data (\citealt{Leroy2021phangs}) or from \citet{Salak2019} and \citet{Izumi2020} for NGC~1808 and NGC~7469, respectively. The observed line width should at least new an upper limit, if not directly probing the turbulent \dv.$
$The \COabundance  is more like a fiducial value and does not obviously affect later [\CI/CO] results.$
$We also take a fiducial \Sigmol which matches the observed CO(1--0) line brightness temperature and a CO-to-H_2 conversion factor \alphaCO \sim 4 \text{--} 0.8 \; \mathrm{M_{\odot}   (K   km   s^{-1})^{-1}} depending on the assumed conditions (e.g., \citealt{Bolatto2013}; and our paper~II).$
$This \Sigmol directly converts to an N_{\mathrm{H_2}} if assuming that 36\% of the mass is helium. Then N_{\mathrm{H_2}} and \COabundance  together indicate a \COcolumndensity . Only with these assumptions can we unambiguously link an abundance ratio [\CI/CO] (i.e., \CIcolumndensity/\COcolumndensity) to a line flux ratio \RCICO .$
$Additionally, with the same filling factor assumption, \RCICOis also equivalent to the ratio of the CO-to-H_2 and \CI -to-H_2 conversion factors, i.e., \RCICO = \alphaCO/\alphaCI, because they trace the same molecular gas at our resolution.$
$In a companion paper (paper II; Liu et al. 2022 in prep.), we study the behaviors of \alphaCO and \alphaCI in more details, also under both LTE and non-LTE conditions.$

$We determine the LTE solution of [\CI/CO] in Fig.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}.$
$To illustrate the complexity of this problem and the degeneracy of the \Tkin, \COcolumndensity/\dv and [\CI/CO] parameters, we show how \RCICO (y-axis) varies with \RNCINCO (x-axis) and \COcolumndensity  (color bar) in the upper panels, and how \RCICO (contour) can be pinpointed by determining the \Sigmol (right y-axis).$
$At the top of each column the key parameters of the aforementioned representative ISM conditions are shown as text. The assumed \Tkin and \dv generally increase from panels (1) to (7) mimicking real conditions. Observational-driven \Remark{ICO10} ranges and the assumed \Sigmol for these ISM environments are also listed, and can be converted one into the other via \alphaCO. We also list the chosen \COabundance  for clarity.$
$As shown in the upper panels, \RCICO increases with both \RNCINCO and \COcolumndensity  under low-\Tkin conditions. However, a maximum \RCICO is reached in the high \CI  column density regime, where an increasing abundance ratio will no longer increase \RCICO. The line ratio saturates at about 0.5 when \Tkin \sim 15~K, or at about 1 for \Tkin \sim 100~K. The observed line ratios (horizontal dashed lines) are all lower than the saturation limit of \RCICO _{\mathrm{max}} \sim 0.7 \text{--} 0.9, and corresponds to a range of \COcolumndensity or \Sigmol. This range is very wide in the low-\Tkin conditions, with \log \COcolumndensity / \mathrm{cm^{-2}} \sim 17 - 19, but is very narrow at \Tkin \sim 100~K, that is, \RCICO can be determined from [\CI/CO] without much dependence on \COcolumndensity.$
$In the lower panels, the contours of \RCICO = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 are shown in the plane of CO column density \COcolumndensity versus \CI/CO abundance ratio.$
$For a fixed \RCICO , a higher \RNCINCO corresponds to a lower \COcolumndensity in the low-\Tkin regime, but \RCICO  becomes insensitive to \COcolumndensity at a high \Tkin. In the latter case, \RNCINCO alone determines \RCICO .$
$By matching to the expected \Sigmol for each ISM condition, we can obtain an unambiguous \RNCINCO from the observed \RCICO  as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}.$
$In this way, we determine the \RNCINCO to be around 0.1--0.2 for conditions \textit{(1)} and \textit{(2)}, and \sim 0.4 for conditions \textit{(3)} and \textit{(5)}.$
$The SB disk (condition \textit{4}) and AGN environments (conditions \textit{6}/\textit{7}) have \RNCINCO \sim 2 and \sim 1 \text{--} 10, respectively.$
$The strongly enhanced \CI/CO abundance ratios in SB disk and AGN environments are clear signatures of CRDR and XDR, respectively.$
$The NGC~4321 centre is a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER, e.g., \citealt{GarciaBurillo2005}), and given our assumptions it requires \RNCINCO \sim 0.4 in order to explain the observed low line ratio.$
$The gradually increasing \CI/CO abundance ratios in the nuclei of NGC~4321, NGC~3627, NGC~1808 and NGC~7469 agree well with the increasing power of AGN activities, e.g., their X-ray luminosities (Table~\ref{table: targets}).$
$Our assumptions for the Galactic cloud ISM condition are mainly based on \citet{Heyer2009}, \citet{Heyer2015} and \cite{RomanDuval2010}. The obtained [\CI/CO]~\sim 0.1 also agrees well with previous studies using \CI  and CO isotopologues (see Sect.~\ref{subsec: intro RCICO}.$
$For example, \citet{Ikeda1999} reported \RNCINCO \sim 0.05 \textnormal{--} 0.2 for the Orion cloud;$
$\citet{Oka2001} found \RNCINCO = 0.064 \pm 0.035 but a peak of \RNCINCO \sim 0.15 in the DR 15 \HII  region and two IR dark clouds;$
$\citet{Kramer2004} found \RNCINCO \sim 0.11 \textnormal{--} 0.12 in the massive SF region W3;$
$\citet{Genzel1988} found \RNCINCO \sim 0.2 for the massive SF region W51;$
$\citet{Zmuidzinas1988} reported \RNCINCO \sim 0.05 \textnormal{--} 0.15 in several dense clouds.$
$Recently, \citet{Izumi2021} derived an overall \RNCINCO \sim 0.1 in the massive SF region RCW38 at A_V \sim 10 \textnormal{--} 100, consistent with the Orion cloud, but also saw high [\CI/CO] \sim 0.2 \textnormal{--} 0.6 in some even lower column density regions.$
$Accurate determination of all the ISM properties instead of simple assumptions as in this work requires comprehensive, multi-J CO isotopologue observations (e.g., \citealt{Teng2022}).$
$Our representative ISM conditions only new a qualitative diagnostic to understand how to infer the \CI/CO abundance ratio from the observed \RCICO  quantity.$
$Their properties may not be very accurate, and are subject to change with future multi-tracer/CO isotopologue studies.$

$\subsection{Non-LTE results}$
$\label{subsec: non-LTE}$
$We perform the non-LTE calculations using the RADEX code (\citealt{vanderTak2007})$
$with the Large Velocity Gradient (LVG; i.e., expanding sphere) escape probability (\citealt{Scoville1974,Goldreich1974}).$
$Comparing to LTE, the volume density of H_2 is now an additional property that plays a role. The excitation temperature of each line no longer equals \Tkin.$
$We compute the non-LTE line ratios in a grid of ( \Tkin,   \dv,   \COabundance,   \RNCINCO,   \COcolumndensity,   \nHtwo ) parameter sets, then study the line and abundance ratios similarly as in the previous section.$
$In Fig.~\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} we show the non-LTE version of Fig.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}.$
$The non-LTE result does not qualitatively differ from that of LTE.$
$The most obvious difference is that at high temperature (\Tkin > 50~K, given our other assumed conditions), the required [\CI/CO] is lower by \times 2 for the same observed \RCICO, whereas at low temperature (\Tkin \sim 15~K) a \lesssim 2 \times [\CI/CO] is expected for the observed line ratio.$
$As listed in the title of each panel, we assume \log \nHtwo / \mathrm{cm^{-3}} = 2.5 to 3.0 for our conditions (1) to (7).$
$This is based on the fact that low-J CO and \CI  trace the bulk of molecular gas with \log \nHtwo / \mathrm{cm^{-3}} \sim 2--3 (e.g., \citealt{Leroy2017,Liudz2021a}), with a typical value \nHtwo \sim 300   \mathrm{cm^{-3}} widely adopted/found for Galactic and nearby galaxy GMCs (e.g., \citealt{Koda2012,Pety2017}, see also simulations of \citealt{Glover2012b}), whereas a smaller portion of their emission is from the dense gas with \log \nHtwo / \mathrm{cm^{-3}} \sim 4--6 (e.g., \citealt{Gao2004a}).$
$The fraction of the dense gas is expected to increase in more starbursting environment (\citealt{Gao2004b}), so does the mean gas density (\citealt{Liudz2021a}). Therefore, a \log \nHtwo / \mathrm{cm^{-3}} of 3.0 is perhaps a reasonable assumption, or at least a lower limit for our galaxy centres. A 10 \times higher density does not qualitatively change Fig.~\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} except for shifting the expected \RNCINCO to be 50\% higher in the \Tkin > 50~K conditions (making Fig.~\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} more like Fig.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}).$
$Therefore, our non-LTE result strongly confirms the LTE result in the previous section, that the intrinsic \CI/CO abundance has to vary significantly from about 0.1--0.2 to about 1--3, in order to explain the observed line ratios from Galactic GMCs (hundred pc scales) and NGC~3627/4321 SF disk GMCs to NGC~1808/7469 SB disk/AGN (r \lesssim 250~pc) environments.$
$\vspace{2ex}$
$\section{Discussion}$
$\label{sec: Discussion}$
$From this study we see that the line ratio \RCICO increases from 0.1 to 0.2 and > 0.5 from the SF disk to the SB disk and the vicinity (few hundred pc) of X-ray luminous AGN. Although we may be limited by our sample,$
$we suggest that this trend can be extended to general cases at both local and high redshift, because the \CI/CO abundance ratio enhancement is well-predicted by the CRDR and XDR theories.$
$\citet{Papadopoulos2010c} and \citet{Papadopoulos2011} pointed out the key role of CRDR in local (U)LIRGs. With UV photons alone, cold gas in starbursting environments can still be well shielded, hence as cold as \sim 10~K. However, with CRs produced from O, B star clusters and supernova remnants, the gas can be uniformly illuminated and heated up.$
$The extremely starbursty local ULIRGs have a CR density (\xi_{\mathrm{CR}}) 10^{3}--10^{4} times that of the Milky Way (\citealt{Papadopoulos2010c}), and thus will naturally dissociate more CO into \CI .$
$\citet{Bisbas2017} and \citet{Papadopoulos2018} conducted simulations of molecular gas at tens of pc scale with varying CR strength, and found that when \xi_{\mathrm{CR}} is \sim 1 \textnormal{--} 100   \times Galactic value, the gas temperature in the dense gas remains largely unaffected (\sim 10~K).$
$However, when \xi_{\mathrm{CR}} reaches \sim 1000   \times Galactic value as in (U)LIRGs, the gas temperature increases to 30--50~K. The \citet{Bisbas2017} simulation also shows that the \CI  and \ionizedcarbon  fractional abundances at \log A_V \sim 0.5 increase by one and three orders of magnitude, respectively, and the CO fractional abundance decreases correspondingly by over two orders of magnitude, with an increasing \xi_{\mathrm{CR}} from the Galactic value to 100   \times of that.$
$These results are in line with our calculations in Sect.~\ref{subsec: LTE}.$
$Meanwhile, the AGN-driven XDR chemistry and molecule/atom excitation have been firstly modeled in great detail by \citet{Maloney1996}, \citet{Meijerink2005} and \citet{Meijerink2007}. In XDRs, photo-ionization becomes the dominant heating source instead of photo-electric emission from dust grains in PDRs, thus more molecules are dissociated and/or ionized. \citet{Meijerink2005}'s Model~1 shows that CO molecules are fully dissociated when N_{\mathrm{H}} < 10^{23}   \mathrm{cm^{-2}}, then the fractional abundance is gradually increased by six orders of magnitudes from N_{\mathrm{H}} = 10^{23}   \mathrm{cm^{-2}} to 10^{24}   \mathrm{cm^{-2}}. By contrast, the \CI  and \ionizedcarbon  abundances are about constant until reaching the densest part (N_{\mathrm{H}} > 10^{24.5}   \mathrm{cm^{-2}}). Unlike in PDRs, there is no clear \ionizedcarbon /\CI /CO stratification in XDRs (\citealt{Meijerink2007,Wolfire2022}). Their Model~2 with a 100 \times higher energy deposition rate shows that the CO distribution contracts to the highest gas density spots, and the total cumulative [\CI/CO] is increased by about 0.2~dex, reaching \RNCINCO \sim 1.6.$
$This value agrees well with our calculations shown in Figs.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO} and \ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} (the ISM condition 7).$
$Therefore, both in theoretical and observational views, it is clear that the \RCICO line ratio is a good indicator of the starburst's CRDR and AGN's XDR.$
$If a \RCICO line ratio (to be specific, \Remark{ICI10}/\Remark{ICO21}) reaches 0.2--0.5, then the CRDR plays a crucial role and the abundance ratio [\CI/CO] could be \sim 1.$
$If it exceeds 0.5--1.0, then it may only be enhanced by an XDR, e.g., caused by an X-ray luminous AGN, which boosts the abundance ratio [\CI/CO] to \gtrsim 1--2.$

$\section{Conclusion}$
$\label{sec: Conclusion}$
$We presented new beam- and uv-coverage-matched \Remark{CI10} and CO(2--1) maps in the galactocentric radius r \lesssim 7~kpc SF disk of NGC~3627 at \sim 190~pc resolution, and in the r \lesssim 3~kpc disk of NGC~4321 at \sim 270~pc resolution.$
$They are among the largest \CI  mosaic mappings available in nearby galaxies.$
$We combined the imaging of \Remark{CI10} and CO(2--1) in two nearby, more starbursty and AGN-hosting galaxies, i.e., NGC~1808 central \sim1~kpc, and NGC~7469 central \sim1.5~kpc at 140--160~pc resolutions.$
$Together, we studied the spatial distributions of \CI  and CO, and their line ratio \RCICO as functions of various galaxy resolved properties, including CO brightness (Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO}), ISRF \Umean (Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}), and metallicity (Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs metallicity}).$
$In order to obtain the underlying intrinsic [\CI/CO] abundance ratio from the observed line ratio \RCICO, we assumed 7 representative ISM conditions and did both LTE and non-LTE calculations.$
$\vspace{1ex}$
$We summarize our findings as below:$
$\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0ex,topsep=1ex,leftmargin=4ex]$
$    \item The majority of the molecular gas in the SF disks of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321 has a uniform \Remark{RCI10CO21} = 0.10 \pm 0.05.$
$    \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO21} exhibit very similar spatial distributions at our 140--270~pc resolution.$
$    \item The majority of the molecular gas in the SB disk of NGC~1808 has \Remark{RCI10CO21} = 0.20 \pm 0.05.$
$    This elevated line ratio compared to the SF disk is likely caused by a \sim 3 \text{--} 5 \times increased [\CI/CO] abundance ratio, based on our LTE and non-LTE calculations and parameter assumptions (Figs.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO} and \ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO}).$
$    \item The centres (r \lesssim 250~pc) of NGC~4321, NGC~3627, NGC~1808 and NGC~7469 show a strongly increasing trend in \Remark{RCI10CO21}, from 0.05 to 0.5, as a function of I_{\Remark{CO21}} --- i.e., \Remark{RCI10CO21} \approx 0.035   (I_{\Remark{CO21}}/[100\;\Kkms])^{0.8}.$
$    The inferred [\CI/CO] abundance ratio from our non-LTE calculation changes from \sim 0.2 to \sim 3, in line with the increasing X-ray luminosity of the centres/AGNs.$
$    \item The observed \RCICO versus ISRF trend is fairly flat, i.e., \RCICO  is insensitive to ISRF intensity changes, similar to the PDR model prediction calculated with PDRToolbox (although our resolution is much coarser than the physical scale of PDR models; Sect.~\ref{subsection: ISRF}).$
$    \item We find a \RCICO versus metallicity trend consistent with previous observations that covered lower-metallicity environments (\sim 0.2   \mathrm{Z_{\odot}}; \citealt{Bolatto2000b}), within the metallicity range (\sim 0.7 \text{--} 1   \mathrm{Z_{\odot}}) of our sample (Sect.~\ref{subsec: metallicity}).$
$    \item Our inferred [\CI/CO] abundance ratios agree well with the CRDR and XDR's theoretical studies.$
$    Given the drastically changed \RCICO , we propose that the \CI  to CO line ratio can be a promising indicator of CRDR (starbursting) and XDR (AGN). For instance, an observed line flux ratio of$
$    \Remark{RCI10CO21} \sim 0.2 \textnormal{--} 0.5 and \gtrsim 0.5 effectively indicates CRDR and XDR, respectively.$
$    \item We do not find ubiquitous "CO-dark", \CI -bright gas at the outer r\sim 1 \text{--} 3~kpc disks of NGC~3627 and NGC4321, nor systematic enhancement in \RCICO  at CO-faintest sightlines via stacking, mainly due to the incompleteness of our data.$
$    Nevertheless, a few sightlines, e.g., Region~22 in NGC~3627 show high \RCICO ~\sim 0.5 which do not fully comply with the noise behavior seen in our CASA simulations.$

$\section{Data reduction, imaging and moment map generation}$
$\label{appendix: data reduction}$
$After downloading the raw data, i.e., 12m+7m for \Remark{CO21} and 7m for \Remark{CI10}, respectively, we ran the observatory calibration pipeline ("scriptForPI") to reduce the data.$
$As shown in \citet{Leroy2021pipeline}, the observatory calibration produces well-calibrated visibility data without further manual flagging.$
$We then split out the visibility data and proceeded to the imaging step.$
$In order to match the spatial resolution of \Remark{CO21} and \Remark{CI10}, we carefully matched their uv ranges.$
$We flagged the \Remark{CO21} visibility data outside the uv range of 19--68~m (\sim15--52k\lambda) so as to match the uv range of the \Remark{CI10} data (minimum to 80\% percentile: 8.9--32~m, or \sim15--52k\lambda).$
$Given that the \Remark{CI10} uv plane distribution is elliptic, while the uv range selection in \incode{CASA} is circular, our chosen thresholds are adjusted to make the final \Remark{CO21} synthesized beam similar to that of \Remark{CI10}.$
$Note that in a later step we also convolved both image cubes to the exact same rounded beam (3.46") before generating the moment maps.$
$The \textit{PHANGS-ALMA imaging \& post-processing pipeline} \footnote{\url{https://github.com/akleroy/phangs_imaging_scripts}; version 2.0.} developed by \citet{Leroy2021pipeline} is used for creating line cubes and moment maps. The code is suitable for general nearby galaxy strong line mapping interferometric and total power mosaic data. In brief, the visibility data are carefully transformed into the user-given channel width and frequency range corresponding to the line plus line-free channels, then continuum is subtracted by fitting an order of zero polynomial. Then, two stages of imaging ("cleaning") are performed: first a multi-scale cleaning down to \sim4\sigma, then a single-scale cleaning down to \sim1\sigma. At each stage, \incode{CASA}'s \incode{tclean} task is iteratively called so as to force many major cycles, which has proven to improve the accuracy of the deconvolution. Before and during the second stage cleaning, a clean mask is computed at each iteration according to the outcome of previous iteration by finding all >2\sigma pixels associated with >4\sigma peaks in a watershed algorithm (\citealt{Rosolowsky2006,Rosolowsky2021}). In this way the cleaning can include as much signal as possible and ensure a signal-free residual.$
$Then the image cubes are corrected for the primary beam attenuation, converted to Kelvin units, and convolved to a common beam, which is the coarser beam of \Remark{CO21} and \Remark{CI10}. Because of our uv range flagging before imaging, the directly \incode{tclean}-imaged beam sizes are already close. This convolution further precisely matches \Remark{CO21} and \Remark{CI10} image cube beams.$
$Next, moment maps are generated with modules in the PHANGS-ALMA pipeline, consistently for CO and \CI . This process includes firstly constructing noise and mask cubes from the image cubes, then combining the masks (i.e., where science signal should present), then computing moment 0 -- line integrated intensity, moment 1 -- line peak velocity, and moment 2 -- line width. The mask cubes are the key in producing moment maps. Here two masks are built: a "broad mask" which contains as much plausible science signal as possible, and a "strict mask" which is optimized for high-confidence signal. The strict mask is made by finding peaks that have >4\sigma over two consecutive channels then expanding down to 2\sigma also with the watershed algorithm. Then the broad mask is obtained by aggregating strict masks made from image cubes convolved to coarser resolutions (\sim30" in this work as well as in \citealt{Leroy2021pipeline}).$
$To make consistent moment maps for CO and \CI , we aggregate their masks together as a joint mask, for broad and strict masks, respectively, then their final moment maps are computed within the joint mask.$
$The resulting \Remark{CO21} and \Remark{CI10} line intensity maps are then used for our next line ratio analysis. The line velocity and line width maps are not further analyzed, but are consistent with the products from the PHANGS-ALMA survey's data release as well as in \citet{Lang2020}. Given that the PHANGS-ALMA 12m+7m+tp \Remark{CO21} has the full spatial information and are deeper, their line velocity and line width maps are more useful for kinematic studies than ours produced from this work.$
$\section{Assessing the missing flux in the NGC~3627 \CI  data}$
$\label{appendix: missing flux}$
$We assess the level of missing flux in the NGC~3627 \CI  data in three ways:$
$(a) comparing with the \textit{Herschel} SPIRE FTS \Remark{CI10} observation in this galaxy,$
$(b) comparing the uv-trimmed CO(2-1) moment-0 map with the PHANGS-ALMA short-spacing corrected (12m+7m+tp) moment-0 map,$
$and (c) performing CASA simulation and comparing with the "true" moment-0 from the skymodel and the derived product from the simulated visibilities.$
$Method (a):$
$NGC~3627 has been observed with the \textit{Herschel} SPIRE (\citealt{Griffin2010}) Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS; \citealt{Naylor2010}) in mapping mode with nearly Nyquist sampling.$
$\cite{Liudz2015} reduced the archival data and extracted the line fluxes for each groups of pointings. \Remark{CI10} is detected with \SNR\sim4-5 at three sightlines from the galaxy centre to the southern bar end, with R.A. and Dec. coordinates (J2000) 170.061905, +12.991336, 170.066361 +12.987091, and 170.071243 +12.981615, respectively. The \Remark{CI10} luminosities are 1.44 \pm 0.31, 2.01 \pm 0.48, and 1.71 \pm 0.40 \times 10^{7} \; \mathrm{K km s^{-1} pc^{2}}, respectively, where the errors are purely from the RMS of line-free FTS spectra. By convolving our \Remark{CI10} line cube to the FTS beam of \sim39" then extracting the moment maps, we measure a \Remark{CI10} line luminosity of 0.52, 0.33 and 0.29 \times 10^{7} \; \mathrm{K km s^{-1} pc^{2}} at the above three positions, respectively, which means a missing flux of 36-75\% at the galaxy centre and 68-88\% at the southern bar end (at a 95\% confidence level).$
$Method (b):$
$We made ratio maps of our uv-trimmed CO(2-1) moment-0 map, and that of the original PHANGS-ALMA short-spacing-corrected (12m+7m+tp) CO(2-1) data but convolved to the corresponding resolution before making the moment maps. The ratio maps are made at two resolutions: the FTS 39" beam, and our working resolution of 3.46". The former leads to a missing flux of 26\%, 31\% and 36\% from the galaxy centre to the southern bar end. Note that the above \textit{Herschel} FTS analysis indicates in general a higher missing flux, but the FTS measurements are of low \SNR and errors purely from the RMS of the spectra can not fully account for other errors like pointing, spectral response, off-axis spaxel calibration, etc.$
$The latter ratio map shows that the missing flux at our working resolution and within the strict mask varies from \sim60\% to as low as 6\% at the brightest pixels. This is consistent with our next method based on simulation.$
$Method (c):$
$We performed detailed simulations of 7m-only \Remark{CI10} and 12m+7m \Remark{CO21} observations with the \incode{CASA} \incode{simobserve} task. We use the PHANGS-ALMA 12m+7m CO(2-1) clean model cube (one of the output products of \incode{CASA} \incode{tclean} runs) as the input \incode{skymodel} for \Remark{CO21}, and that scaled by a factor of 0.2 in Kelvin units for \Remark{CI10} (representing a constant \RCICO=0.2).$
$Note that we do not use the short-spacing-corrected PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) cube because it has a finite beam size of \sim1", and simulation based on that may result in more extended emissions. On the contrary, the clean model cube has an infinite resolution, and because both "multiscale" and "singlescale" cleaning are used in the PHANGS-ALMA imaging, the clean model contains point as well as extended sources.$
$We also set the actual observing dates and integration times as the real observations.$
$Then we run \incode{CASA} \incode{simobserve} to simulate the visibilities of each observing block, concatenate them together, and process them into image cubes and moment maps in the same way as described in Appendix~\ref{appendix: data reduction}. Meanwhile, by convolving the input \incode{skymodel} with a 2D Gaussian beam corresponding to our working resolution, and integrating over the spectral axis, we obtain a "true" \incode{skymodel} moment-0 map which can be directly compared to the imaged moment-0 maps from the simulation. Their ratio map shows a missing flux of \sim50\% to \sim7\% in the strict mask, and more specifically, 24\%, 58\%, 85\% and 96\% pixels selected in our method as for real data have a missing flux < 20\%, < 30\%, < 40\% and < 50\%, respectively.$
$Fig.~\ref{fig: missing flux} illustrates the results from methods (b) (upper panels) and (c) (lower panels). Left panels show the \Remark{CO21} moment-0 maps, analyzed at the same working resolution as our main analysis in Appendix~\ref{appendix: data reduction}. The simulated data show a fainter emission because we used the clean mode cube as the \incode{skymodel}, which was made by cleaning the PHANGS-ALMA 12m+7m data down to 1~\sigma within the clean mask voxels. This will indeed lose some fluxes. However, the right panels show that the two methods lead to consistent missing flux results.$
$Note that in the last panel of Fig.~\ref{fig: missing flux}, some regions appear black in the simulation-based analysis because we require line ratios to be analyzed in the strict mask, while these regions are not in it anymore. This is because the \incode{skymodel} loses some fluxes as mentioned above, thus the strict mask is smaller, and also because in the simulation we assumed a constant \RCICO which may lead to fainter \CI  than real data along faint sightlines, e.g., Region 22,  thus further shrinking the strict mask where both lines need to have sufficient \SNR.$
$Bearing these in mind, we conclude that methods (b) and (c) have consistent results on the missing flux, and method (a) is less accurate due to the unconsidered uncertainties.$
$These checks show that the overall missing flux in NGC~3627 is 31\% based on the full- and trimmed-uv \Remark{CO21} analysis, or \sim36-88\% based on the more-uncertain \textit{Herschel} data. At the pixel level, it varies from 7\% to \sim50\% from bright to faint sightlines at our working resolution of 3.46".$
$These values are as expected given our ACA-only observation setup.$
$We emphasize again that by applying the uv-matching in our data reduction, our \CI /\CO  line ratio study is not obviously affected by the missing flux issue, except perhaps in the faintest pixels or "cloud edges".$

$\section{Assessing noise-induced \CI  enhancement with simulation}$
$\label{appendix: simulation}$
$In Appendix~\ref{appendix: missing flux} we described our simulation. We also use it to assess how the noise can induce artificial [\CI/CO] line ratio variation.$
$In Fig.~\ref{fig: sim line ratio image} we show the line ratio map from the simulation with a constant \RCICO=0.2, and in Fig.~\ref{fig: sim line ratio scatter} we show the scatter plots with simulation results similar to Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO}. Interestingly, we see certain \CI/CO variations, especially \CI  "enhancement" at the edge of galaxy centre's gas clump (region~1), and the edge of the northern spiral arm (Region 14). Nevertheless, the trend is very different from the real data, i.e., Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO}.$
$First, galaxy centre has a much weaker [\CI/CO] in the real data, whereas in the simulation it is inverted.$
$Second, the scatter is much larger in real data, with a tail of \CI  enhanced regions which is not seen in the simulation.$
$Third, from the bottom panels of Fig.~\ref{fig: sim line ratio scatter}, where \SNR is shown, we see that \RCICO is biased to be lower in low-\SNR situation. Thus the high \CI  in real data is unlikely to be a bias of low \SNR.$

$\section{Data reduction, imaging and moment map generation}$
$\label{appendix: data reduction}$
$After downloading the raw data, i.e., 12m+7m for \Remark{CO21} and 7m for \Remark{CI10}, respectively, we ran the observatory calibration pipeline ("scriptForPI") to reduce the data.$
$As shown in \citet{Leroy2021pipeline}, the observatory calibration produces well-calibrated visibility data without further manual flagging.$
$We then split out the visibility data and proceeded to the imaging step.$
$In order to match the spatial resolution of \Remark{CO21} and \Remark{CI10}, we carefully matched their uv ranges.$
$We flagged the \Remark{CO21} visibility data outside the uv range of 19--68~m (\sim15--52k\lambda) so as to match the uv range of the \Remark{CI10} data (minimum to 80\% percentile: 8.9--32~m, or \sim15--52k\lambda).$
$Given that the \Remark{CI10} uv plane distribution is elliptic, while the uv range selection in \incode{CASA} is circular, our chosen thresholds are adjusted to make the final \Remark{CO21} synthesized beam similar to that of \Remark{CI10}.$
$Note that in a later step we also convolved both image cubes to the exact same rounded beam (3.46") before generating the moment maps.$
$The \textit{PHANGS-ALMA imaging \& post-processing pipeline} \footnote{\url{https://github.com/akleroy/phangs_imaging_scripts}; version 2.0.} developed by \citet{Leroy2021pipeline} is used for creating line cubes and moment maps. The code is suitable for general nearby galaxy strong line mapping interferometric and total power mosaic data. In brief, the visibility data are carefully transformed into the user-given channel width and frequency range corresponding to the line plus line-free channels, then continuum is subtracted by fitting an order of zero polynomial. Then, two stages of imaging ("cleaning") are performed: first a multi-scale cleaning down to \sim4\sigma, then a single-scale cleaning down to \sim1\sigma. At each stage, \incode{CASA}'s \incode{tclean} task is iteratively called so as to force many major cycles, which has proven to improve the accuracy of the deconvolution. Before and during the second stage cleaning, a clean mask is computed at each iteration according to the outcome of previous iteration by finding all >2\sigma pixels associated with >4\sigma peaks in a watershed algorithm (\citealt{Rosolowsky2006,Rosolowsky2021}). In this way the cleaning can include as much signal as possible and ensure a signal-free residual.$
$Then the image cubes are corrected for the primary beam attenuation, converted to Kelvin units, and convolved to a common beam, which is the coarser beam of \Remark{CO21} and \Remark{CI10}. Because of our uv range flagging before imaging, the directly \incode{tclean}-imaged beam sizes are already close. This convolution further precisely matches \Remark{CO21} and \Remark{CI10} image cube beams.$
$Next, moment maps are generated with modules in the PHANGS-ALMA pipeline, consistently for CO and \CI . This process includes firstly constructing noise and mask cubes from the image cubes, then combining the masks (i.e., where science signal should present), then computing moment 0 -- line integrated intensity, moment 1 -- line peak velocity, and moment 2 -- line width. The mask cubes are the key in producing moment maps. Here two masks are built: a "broad mask" which contains as much plausible science signal as possible, and a "strict mask" which is optimized for high-confidence signal. The strict mask is made by finding peaks that have >4\sigma over two consecutive channels then expanding down to 2\sigma also with the watershed algorithm. Then the broad mask is obtained by aggregating strict masks made from image cubes convolved to coarser resolutions (\sim30" in this work as well as in \citealt{Leroy2021pipeline}).$
$To make consistent moment maps for CO and \CI , we aggregate their masks together as a joint mask, for broad and strict masks, respectively, then their final moment maps are computed within the joint mask.$
$The resulting \Remark{CO21} and \Remark{CI10} line intensity maps are then used for our next line ratio analysis. The line velocity and line width maps are not further analyzed, but are consistent with the products from the PHANGS-ALMA survey's data release as well as in \citet{Lang2020}. Given that the PHANGS-ALMA 12m+7m+tp \Remark{CO21} has the full spatial information and are deeper, their line velocity and line width maps are more useful for kinematic studies than ours produced from this work.$
$\section{Assessing the missing flux in the NGC~3627 \CI  data}$
$\label{appendix: missing flux}$
$We assess the level of missing flux in the NGC~3627 \CI  data in three ways:$
$(a) comparing with the \textit{Herschel} SPIRE FTS \Remark{CI10} observation in this galaxy,$
$(b) comparing the uv-trimmed CO(2-1) moment-0 map with the PHANGS-ALMA short-spacing corrected (12m+7m+tp) moment-0 map,$
$and (c) performing CASA simulation and comparing with the "true" moment-0 from the skymodel and the derived product from the simulated visibilities.$
$Method (a):$
$NGC~3627 has been observed with the \textit{Herschel} SPIRE (\citealt{Griffin2010}) Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS; \citealt{Naylor2010}) in mapping mode with nearly Nyquist sampling.$
$\cite{Liudz2015} reduced the archival data and extracted the line fluxes for each groups of pointings. \Remark{CI10} is detected with \SNR\sim4-5 at three sightlines from the galaxy centre to the southern bar end, with R.A. and Dec. coordinates (J2000) 170.061905, +12.991336, 170.066361 +12.987091, and 170.071243 +12.981615, respectively. The \Remark{CI10} luminosities are 1.44 \pm 0.31, 2.01 \pm 0.48, and 1.71 \pm 0.40 \times 10^{7} \; \mathrm{K km s^{-1} pc^{2}}, respectively, where the errors are purely from the RMS of line-free FTS spectra. By convolving our \Remark{CI10} line cube to the FTS beam of \sim39" then extracting the moment maps, we measure a \Remark{CI10} line luminosity of 0.52, 0.33 and 0.29 \times 10^{7} \; \mathrm{K km s^{-1} pc^{2}} at the above three positions, respectively, which means a missing flux of 36-75\% at the galaxy centre and 68-88\% at the southern bar end (at a 95\% confidence level).$
$Method (b):$
$We made ratio maps of our uv-trimmed CO(2-1) moment-0 map, and that of the original PHANGS-ALMA short-spacing-corrected (12m+7m+tp) CO(2-1) data but convolved to the corresponding resolution before making the moment maps. The ratio maps are made at two resolutions: the FTS 39" beam, and our working resolution of 3.46". The former leads to a missing flux of 26\%, 31\% and 36\% from the galaxy centre to the southern bar end. Note that the above \textit{Herschel} FTS analysis indicates in general a higher missing flux, but the FTS measurements are of low \SNR and errors purely from the RMS of the spectra can not fully account for other errors like pointing, spectral response, off-axis spaxel calibration, etc.$
$The latter ratio map shows that the missing flux at our working resolution and within the strict mask varies from \sim60\% to as low as 6\% at the brightest pixels. This is consistent with our next method based on simulation.$
$Method (c):$
$We performed detailed simulations of 7m-only \Remark{CI10} and 12m+7m \Remark{CO21} observations with the \incode{CASA} \incode{simobserve} task. We use the PHANGS-ALMA 12m+7m CO(2-1) clean model cube (one of the output products of \incode{CASA} \incode{tclean} runs) as the input \incode{skymodel} for \Remark{CO21}, and that scaled by a factor of 0.2 in Kelvin units for \Remark{CI10} (representing a constant \RCICO=0.2).$

$We present new neutral atomic carbon [C~\textsc{i}]~( ^3P_1~\to~ ^3P_0) mapping observations within the inner \sim 7~kpc and \sim 4~kpc of the disks of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321 at a spatial resolution of 190~pc and 270~pc, respectively, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) Atacama Compact Array (ACA).$
$We combine these with the CO(2--1) data from PHANGS-ALMA, and literature [C~\textsc{i}] and CO data for two other starburst and/or active galactic nucleus (AGN) galaxies (NGC~1808, NGC~7469), to study: \textit{a)} the spatial distributions of C~\textsc{i} and CO emission; \textit{b)} the observed line ratio \RCICO = I_{\mathrm{[C{\normalfont\textsc{i}}]}(1\textnormal{--}0)} / I_{\mathrm{CO}(2\textnormal{--}1)} as a function of various galactic properties; and \textit{c)} the abundance ratio of [C~\textsc{i}/CO].$
$We find excellent spatial correspondence between C~\textsc{i} and CO emission and nearly uniform \RCICO \sim 0.1 across the majority of the star-forming disks of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321.$
$However, \RCICO strongly varies from \sim 0.05 at the centre of NGC~4321 to > 0.2 \text{--} 0.5 in NGC~1808's starbursting centre and NGC~7469's centre with an X-ray-luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN).$
$Meanwhile, \RCICOdoes not obviously vary with \Umean, similar to the prediction of photodissociation dominated region (PDR) models.$
$We also find a mildly decreasing \RCICOwith an increasing metallicity over 0.7\text{--}0.85 \mathrm{Z_{\odot}}, consistent with the literature.$
$Assuming various typical ISM conditions representing giant molecular clouds, active star-forming regions and strong starbursting environments, we calculate the local-thermodynamic-equilibrium radiative transfer and estimate the [C~\textsc{i}/CO] abundance ratio to be \sim 0.1 across the disks of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321, similar to previous large-scale findings in Galactic studies.$
$However, this abundance ratio likely has a substantial increase to \sim 1 and \gtrsim 1--5 in NGC~1808's starburst and NGC~7469's strong AGN environments, respectively, in line with the expectations for cosmic-ray dominated region (CRDR) and X-ray dominated region (XDR) chemistry.$
$Finally, we do not find a robust evidence for a generally CO-dark, C~\textsc{i}-bright gas in the disk areas we probed.$

$\section{Introduction}$
$\label{subsec: intro RCICO}$
$\subsection{Neutral atomic carbon in the interstellar medium}$
$Neutral atomic carbon (C^0 or \neutralcarbon) is an important phase of carbon in the interstellar medium (ISM) besides ionized carbon (C^+ or \ionizedcarbon) and carbon monoxide (CO).$
$Its ^{3}P state is split into three fine-structure levels. The^{3}P_{1} \to  ^{3}P_{0} transition line at 492.16065~GHz,$
$hereafter \Remark{CI10}$
$, has an upper energy level of E_u = 23.620~K and a critical density of n_{\mathrm{crit}} \sim 1.0 \times 10^{3} \;\mathrm{cm^{-3}} (at a temperature of 50~K) \footnote{n_{\mathrm{crit}} \equiv A / \gamma, where A is the Einstein A coefficient for the transition and \gamma the rate of collisional de-excitation with hydrogen molecules, with values from \cite{Schroder1991} as compiled in the Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database (\citealt{Schoier2005}), \url{https://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~moldata/}},$
$and the^{3}P_{2} \to  ^{3}P_{1} transition line at 809.34197~GHz has E_u = 62.462~K and n_{\mathrm{crit}} \sim 3.4 \times 10^{3} \;\mathrm{cm^{-3}}.$
$Therefore, they are easily excited in the cold ISM environment.$
$Given the high abundance of carbon in the ISM, \neutralcarbon, CO and \ionizedcarbon  are the most powerful cold ISM tracers, and are the most widely used tools to probe cold ISM properties and hence galaxy evolution at cosmological distances.$
$The interstellar \neutralcarbon  is produced from$
$the photodissociation of CO molecules by UV photons and the recombination of \ionizedcarbon , both happening in photodissociation regions (PDRs; \citealt{Langer1976,deJong1980,Tielens1985a,Tielens1985b,vanDishoeck1986,vanDishoeck1988,Sternberg1989,Sternberg1995,Hollenbach1991,Hollenbach1999,Kaufman1999,Wolfire2010,Madden2020,Bisbas2021}, also see reviews by \citealt{Genzel1989,Jaffe1985,Hollenbach1997,Wolfire2022}).$
$In the simple plane-parallel (i.e., 1-D) PDR model, \neutralcarbon  exists in a layer where UV photons can penetrate through the molecular gas but cannot maintain a high carbon ionizing rate.$
$Such a layer is suggested to have an intermediate gas surface density (N_{\mathrm{H_2}} \sim 1 \textnormal{--} 4 \times 10^{20} \;\mathrm{cm^{-2}}), fairly cold temperature (10 to a few tens K), and moderate visual extinction (A_V \sim 1 - 4).$
$CO molecules dominate the more shielded interior of this layer and \ionizedcarbon  dominates the exterior.$
$Hydrogen molecules are gradually photodissociated to atoms across this layer (A_V \sim 0.1 - 4).$
$This plane-parallel scenario qualitatively explains the layered structure of the Orion Bar PDR in our Galaxy on sub-pc scales (e.g.,  \citealt{Genzel1989,Tielens1993,Tauber1994,Hogerheijde1995b,Hollenbach1999,Goicoechea2016}), and the \rho~Ophiuchi~A PDR in a recent study with an unprecedented resolution of 360~AU (\citealt{Yamagishi2021}), where the interplay between individual young, massive (O, B) stars and the ISM can be directly observed.$
$However, such simple models cannot fully explain molecular clouds. Plenty of observations in Galactic molecular clouds, \ionizedhydrogen  regions and star-formation complexes have revealed a widespread \neutralcarbon  distribution over most areas of molecular clouds on scales of a few to ten pc, and a relatively high \neutralcarbon  fractional abundance even at a large A_V depth > 10~mag (\citealt{Phillips1980,Phillips1981,Wootten1982,Keene1985,Keene1987,Jaffe1985,Zmuidzinas1986,Zmuidzinas1988,Genzel1988,Frerking1989,Plume1994,Plume1999,Gerin1998a,Tatematsu1999,Ikeda1999,Ikeda2002,Yamamoto2001,Zhang2001,Kamegai2003,Oka2004,Izumi2021}).$
$This observational evidence actually requires PDRs to be clumpy  (\citealt{Stutzki1988,Genzel1988,Burton1990,Meixner1993,Spaans1997,Kramer2004,Kramer2008,Pineda2008,Sun2008}), with a volume filling factor much less than unity (e.g., \sim 0.1 - 0.3; \citealt{Stutzki1988}), so that$
$UV photons can penetrate through most of the cloud, except for the densest clumps.$
$Therefore, the spatial co-existence of \neutralcarbon  and low rotational transition (low-J) CO lines can be well explained by such an inter-clump medium inside the molecular clouds.$
$Alternatively, cosmic rays (CRs) have also been proposed to be the reason for the \neutralcarbon -CO association as they can penetrate much deeper than UV photons into clouds, and thus more uniformly dissociate CO molecules into \neutralcarbon  inside clouds (\citealt{Field1969,Padovani2009,Papadopoulos2010c,Ivlev2015,Papadopoulos2018}).$
$\subsection{Variations of the \CI/\CO line ratio (\RCICO) in the literature}$
$Although the spatial distributions of \CI  and low-J CO emission resemble each other surprisingly well from molecular clouds to Galactic scales (e.g., across the Galactic plane; \citealt{Wright1991,Bennett1994,Oka2005,Burton2015}) and in external galaxies with spatially resolved observations (e.g., \citealt{Schilke1993,White1994b,Harrison1995,Israel1995,Israel2001,Israel2003,Zhang2014,Krips2016,Cicone2018,Crocker2019,Jiao2019,Miyamoto2018,Miyamoto2021,Salak2019,Izumi2020,Saito2020,Michiyama2020,Michiyama2021}),$
$their line intensity ratio, \Remark{RCI10CO10} = \Remark{ICI10} / \Remark{ICO10} \footnote{The line intensity I has brightness temperature units \mathrm{K km s^{-1}}.}, does vary according to local ISM conditions --- \CI  and CO fractional abundance (i.e., metallicity), excitation condition (e.g., excitation temperature T_{\mathrm{ex}} and optical depth \tau), and UV and/or CR radiation field.$
$At individual molecular cloud scales, \Remark{RCI10CO10} (or column density ratio) seems to vary from \gtrsim 0.5 (or \gtrsim 0.2 for column density ratio) to <0.1 with an increasing N_{\mathrm{H2}} and A_V, e.g., from cloud surface or PDR front to the interior \citep[e.g.][]{Frerking1982,Genzel1988,Oka2004,Kramer2004,Kramer2008,Mookerjea2006,Sun2008,Yamagishi2021}.$
$At sub-galactic scales, when individual clouds are smoothed out, \Remark{RCI10CO10} is found to lie in a narrower range of \sim 0.1 \text{--} 0.3. For example, across the Galactic plane, the ratio is found to change only slightly within a galactocentric radius of 3--7~kpc (\sim 0.08 \text{--} 0.12, overall mean = 0.105 \pm 0.004; \citealt{Oka2005});$
$whereas in the starburst galaxies like M~82 and NGC~253, \Remark{RCI10CO10} or the [\CI]/CO abundance ratio is a factor of 3--5 higher than the Galactic value (\citealt{Schilke1993,White1994b,Krips2016}).$
$Recent high-resolution (hundred pc scales) \Remark{CI10} mapping studies in the nearby spiral galaxy M~83 (\citealt{Miyamoto2021}) and starburst galaxy IRAS~F18293-3413 (\citealt{Saito2020}) reported tightly-correlated \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO10} emission, with scaling relations at hundred parsecs equivalent to$
$\Remark{RCI10CO10} = 0.14 \times (L^{\prime}_{\Remark{CO10}}/10^{6.0} [\Remark{Kkmspc2}])^{-0.13}$
$and$
$\Remark{RCI10CO10} = 0.21 \times (L^{\prime}_{\Remark{CO10}}/10^{6.8} [\Remark{Kkmspc2}])^{+0.54},$
$respectively.$
$The discrepant power-law indices reflects different trends in individual galaxies that are not fully understood.$
$Meanwhile, in the central \lesssim 100~pc of NGC~7469 close to the X-ray-luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN), \RCICO  is found to be substantially enhanced by a factor of >10 (reaching \Remark{RCI10CO10} \approx 1; \citealt{Izumi2020}; see also the Circinus Galaxy's AGN with \Remark{RCI10CO32} \approx 0.9 in \citealt{Izumi2018}).$
$Furthermore, in the low-metallicity Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) environments, a factor of 1.5 - 3 \times higher \RCICO  values have been found (\citealt{Bolatto2000b,Bolatto2000c}; see also other low-metallicity galaxies: \citealt{Bolatto2000a,Hunt2017}).$
$These studies indicate that \RCICO  is sensitive to ISM conditions among and within galaxies.$
$However, previous extragalactic studies are mainly focused on starburst galaxies and bright galaxy centres. How \RCICO  behaves across the disks and spiral arms of typical star-forming galaxies is much less explored. Whether \CI  can trace the so-called CO-dark molecular gas at a low gas density or metallicity is also still in question.$
$Understanding \RCICO  variation and quantifying the \CI  and \CO  excitation in extragalactic environments is now particularly important given the rapidly growing numbers and diverse galactic environments of \CI  line observations at cosmological distances (e.g., \citealt{Weiss2003,Weiss2005,Pety2004,Wagg2006,Walter2011,Danielson2011,AlaghbandZadeh2013,Gullberg2016,Bothwell2017,Popping2017,Yang2017,Emonts2018,Valentino2018,Valentino2020,Bourne2019,Nesvadba2019,Dannerbauer2019,Jin2019,Brisbin2019,Boogaard2020,Cortzen2020,Harrington2021,Dunne2021,Lee2021}).$
$\subsection{What drives \RCICO? --- the need for high-resolution mapping across wide galactic environments}$
$High-resolution mapping of \CI  and CO from disks and spiral arms of nearby galaxies is indispensable for understanding and quantifying the ISM \CI  and CO physics. In particular, the following questions will be answered only with such observations:$
$Do \CI  and low-J CO have the same spatial distributions across galaxy disks?$
$Does the \RCICO  line ratio vary significantly across galaxy disks?$
$How does the \RCICO  line ratio vary among different local galaxies?$
$How can the observed \RCICO  line ratio be reliably converted to the \CI  and CO column density ratio (i.e., solving their radiation transfer equations and level population statistics and obtaining optical depths and excitation temperature)?$
$Currently, high-resolution (hundreds of parsec scale) imaging/mapping of \CI  in nearby galaxies relies on radio telescopes at high altitudes, e.g., the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE, 10-m single-dish), Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX, 12-m single-dish), and is limited to the available weather conditions corresponding to the high frequency of \CI  lines. Therefore, only a handful of galaxies have been imaged/mapped.$
$These include NGC~6240 by \citet{Cicone2018}, Circinus Galaxy by \citet{Izumi2018}, NGC~613 by \citet{Miyamoto2018}, NGC~1808 by \citet{Salak2019}, NGC~7469 by \citet{Izumi2020}, IRAS~F18293-3413 by \citet{Saito2020}, NGC~6052 by \citet[][\CI  undetected]{Michiyama2020}, 36 (U)LIRGs by \citet{Michiyama2021}, M~83 by \citet[][mapped the centre and northern part with ASTE]{Miyamoto2021}, Arp~220 by \citet{Ueda2022}, and NGC~1068 by \citet{Saito2022a,Saito2022b}.$
$Nevertheless, all of these observations, except for M~83, targeted the centres of starburst, IR-luminous and/or AGN host galaxies. M~83 is the only typical star-forming main sequence galaxy having a high-quality \CI  mapping. However, its map is still limited to a quarter of its inner \sim3~kpc disk.$
$In this work, we present two new \CI  mapping observations with the ALMA Atacama Compact Array (or Morita Array; 7-m dish, hereafter ACA or 7m) in nearby spiral galaxies NGC~3627 and NGC~4321.$
$Our observations aimed at detecting \CI  in the disks, and thus are much larger-area and deeper than previous \CI  maps.$
$By further adding a starburst and an AGN-host galaxy from the literature into our analysis, we present a comprehensive study of the \Remark{RCI10CO21} line ratio (hereafter \RCICO; ratios of other \CI /CO transitions will be explicitly written otherwise) in nearby star-forming disk and starburst and AGN environments.$
$In order to quantify the \CI  and CO abundance ratio,$
$we have further calculated the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE radiative transfer of \CI  and CO under several \textit{representative ISM conditions}.$
$The results from this study could thus be one of the most comprehensive local benchmarks for understanding the \CI  and CO line ratio and abundance variations.$
$The paper, as the first one of our series of papers, is organized as follows.$
$Sect.~\ref{sec: Observations} describes the sample selection, observations and data reduction.$
$Sect.~\ref{sec: Results} presents the spatial distribution and variation of \RCICO.$
$Sect.~\ref{sec: Excitation Analysis} presents the analysis of \CI  and CO excitation and radiative transfer and thus the abundance (species column density) ratio.$
$In Sect.~\ref{sec: Discussion} we discuss various topics relating to the [\CI/CO] abundance variation, CRDR, XDR, and CO-dark gas.$
$Finally we conclude in Sect.~\ref{sec: Conclusion}.$
$Our companion paper~II (D. Liu et al. in prep.) presents the detailed radiative transfer calculation and \CI  and CO conversion factors, and is related to the abundance calculation in this paper.$

$\section{Targets and observations}$
$\label{sec: Observations}$
$\subsection{Target selection}$
$\label{subsection: Target Selection}$
$Our targets, NGC~3627 and NGC~4321, are selected from a joint sample of the PHANGS-ALMA CO(2--1) (\citealt{Leroy2021phangs}), PHANGS-HST (\citealt{PHANGSHST}), and PHANGS-MUSE (\citealt{PHANGSMUSE}) surveys, with CO line intensities and systemic velocities best suitable for ALMA Band 8 \CI  mapping.$
$The PHANGS-ALMA sample consists of 90 nearby star-forming galaxies initially selected at distances of 2 \lesssim d / \mathrm{Mpc} \lesssim 23, with a stellar mass \log (M_{\star}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}) > 9.75, and which are not too inclined and visible to ALMA. They represent the typical star-forming main sequence galaxies in the local Universe.$
$The PHANGS-HST sample \citep{PHANGSHST} is a subsample of 38 PHANGS-ALMA galaxies, providing high-resolution stellar properties.$
$The PHANGS-MUSE large program \citep{PHANGSMUSE} targeted a subsample of 19 PHANGS-ALMA galaxies suitable for VLT/MUSE optical integral field unit (IFU) observations, achieving similar spatial coverage as in PHANGS-ALMA and providing rich nebular emission lines, attenuation, stellar age and metallicity and H~\textsc{ii} region information (e.g., \citealt{Kreckel2019, Kreckel2020, Pessa2021, Santoro2021, Williams2022}).$
$For the legacy value, we selected our sample from the joint ALMA+MUSE+HST sample pool, considered CO surface brightness, mapping area, \CI  line frequency and the transmission in the ALMA Band 8.$
$In this work, we present the new \CI  data of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321.$
$Because of the ALMA Band 8 sensitivity and the expected fainter \CI  line intensity than CO, the \CI  mapping areas are smaller than their CO(2--1) maps, but they are still the largest (\sim1'-2.35') and deepest (rms~\sim0.04~K per \sim5~km~s^{-1}) \CI  mapping with ALMA.$
$Furthermore, in order to study the \CI  and CO in different galactic environments, we selected two starbursting and/or AGN-host galaxies from the literature whose ALMA \Remark{CI10} and CO(2--1) data are available in the archive: NGC~1808 \citep{Salak2019} and NGC~7469 \citep{Izumi2020}.$
$NGC~1808 has ALMA mosaic observations covering its \sim 1~kpc starburst ring, and NGC~7469 has ALMA single-pointing observations covering its inner \sim 3~kpc area.$
$\subsection{New ALMA ACA Band 8 observations}$
$\label{subsection: ALMA Band 8 Observation}$
$Our \CI  observations for NGC~3627 were taken under the ALMA project 2018.1.01290.S (PI: D. Liu) during June 3rd to Sept. 29th, 2019 with ACA-only at Band~8. The total on-source integration time was 30.8~hours. A mosaic with 149 pointings was used to map an area of 94" \times 136" at a position angle of -27^\circ, which covers the galaxy centre, bar and the majority of the spiral arms, and is about 1/3 of the full PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) map area.$
$The achieved line sensitivity per 5 \kms is 45--55~mK (107--130~\mathrm{mJy/beam}) across the \Remark{CI10} line frequencies with a beam of 3.46".$
$The \CI  mapping for NGC~4321 were taken under the ALMA project 2019.1.01635.S (PI: D. Liu; NGC~1365 is also partially observed for this project) during Dec. 3rd, 2019 to July 1st, 2021, also with ACA-only at Band~8. The on-source integration time reached 16.1~hours for the mapping of an area of 55" \times 42" with 23 pointings using the 7m array. The achieved line sensitivity is similar to that of NGC~3627.$
$More detailed information is newd in Table~\ref{table: targets}.$
$ACA (7m) was chosen to new a matched and slightly coarser synthesized beam (\sim 3"-4") than the PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) data. In comparison, the main 12m ALMA array in compact C43-1/2 configurations will result in a \sim 0.4"-0.7" beam and significantly miss large scale (>4-6") emission without ACA.$
$No total power observations were requested in our presented observation, therefore we matched the uv ranges of the raw CO(2--1) and \Remark{CI10} visibility data during our data reduction.$
$We verified that missing flux will not substantially (\sim 30\%) bias our analysis using three methods as detailed in Appendix~\ref{appendix: missing flux}. This includes a CASA simulation of visibilities mimicking our ACA mosaic observations in NGC~3627, from which we find a missing flux as small as 7\% in \CI-bright pixels and up to \sim 50\% in the faintest pixels (and mostly < 30\%).$
$Our data reduction follows the PHANGS-ALMA imaging and post-processing pipeline \citep[][]{Leroy2021pipeline}, including imaging and deconvolution, mosaicking, broad and strict/signal mask generation, and moment map creation.$
$The additional steps in this study are: (a) uv-clipping in the CO(2--1) data to match the uv sampling range of \Remark{CI10}; and (b) making a joint mask of the individual CO(2--1) and \Remark{CI10} masks then extracting the moment maps (in the joint broad mask) and line ratios maps (in the joint strict mask).$
$More technical details are newd in Appendix~\ref{appendix: data reduction}.$
$Our \Remark{CI10} and CO(2--1) line intensity maps, the line ratio maps and \textit{HST} images for the two PHANGS galaxies, NGC~3627 and NGC~4321, are presented in Figs.~\ref{fig: NGC3627 line ratio map} and \ref{fig: NGC4321 line ratio map}, respectively.$
$Our data cubes and moment maps are also made publicly available at$
$the PHANGS-ALMA CADC public repository \footnote{\url{https://www.canfar.net/storage/list/phangs/RELEASES/DZLIU_etal_2022}}.$

$\label{subsection: additional targets}$
$The NGC~1808 ALMA \Remark{CI10}, \Remark{CO10} and \Remark{CO21} observations are presented in \citet{Salak2019} and all are interferometry plus total power, i.e., 12m+7m+tp, thus having no missing flux issue.$
$To study the \CI /\CO  line ratio consistently with our main targets, we only used the \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO21} data.$
$We re-reduced the raw data under ALMA project 2017.1.00984.S (PI: D. Salak) with the observatory calibration pipeline, then imaged, primary-beam-corrected and short-spacing-corrected using the PHANGS-ALMA pipeline in the same way as for our main targets (Appendix~\ref{appendix: data reduction}).$
$Note that in this step we re-reduced and imaged the total power data with the PHANGS-ALMA singledish pipeline (\citealt{Herrera2020,Leroy2021pipeline}) and did the short-spacing correction with the PHANGS-ALMA pipeline right after the primary beam correction.$
$The properties of the final \CO -\CI  beam-matched data cubes are listed in Table~\ref{table: targets}.$
$The NGC~7469 ALMA data are presented in \citet{Izumi2020} and we used the archival raw data of \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO21} under ALMA project 2017.1.00078.S (PI: T. Izumi). These are single pointings toward the centre. \Remark{CI10} is observed with ACA 7m and \Remark{CO21} with the 12m array, both without total power. We re-reduced the data following the same procedure as for NGC~3627 and NGC~4321 with the PHANGS-ALMA pipeline.$
$Our re-reduced \Remark{CI10} and CO(2--1) line intensity and ratio maps for these additional galaxies are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig: other line ratio maps}.$

$\subsection{Spatial distributions}$
$In Figs.~\ref{fig: NGC3627 line ratio map}, \ref{fig: NGC4321 line ratio map} and \ref{fig: other line ratio maps}, we present the beam-matched \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO21} integrated line intensity maps and their ratio maps.$
$The \CI/\CO  line ratio map is computed only for pixels within the joint strict mask area of the two lines, as described in Appendix~\ref{appendix: data reduction}, representing high-confidence signals.$
$In NGC~3627 (Fig.~\ref{fig: NGC3627 line ratio map}), we visually marked 23 regions based on the \CI  and CO commonly-detected (\mathrm{S/N}>3), strict-mask areas for later analysis. Region IDs are sorted by their \Remark{CI10} brightness.$
$Region 1 corresponds to the galaxy centre, Regions 2 and 3 are the southern and northern bar ends, Region 4 is an offset peak next to the galaxy centre, and other regions are mostly on the spiral arms. Most of these regions show a similar \RCICO \sim 0.1, except for, e.g., Regions 20 and 22 which exhibit a somewhat higher ratio of \RCICO \sim 0.5. The edge of Region 4 also shows an enhancement of \CI  yet it is hard to tell whether this is physical or simply caused by edge effects, e.g., as seen in our simulations (Appendix~\ref{appendix: simulation}).$
$We also examined the integrated spectra of each region in Appendix~\ref{appendix: all regions}.$
$The \CI  and CO line profiles are not always well-matched in width and shape. In the galaxy centre (Region 1) and at bright bar-ends (Regions 2, 3, 5), \CI  and CO have similar line widths but \CI  has a lower intensity than CO, whereas in some fainter regions (9, 10, 13, 14), \CI  is narrower than CO and relatively weaker. In Regions 4, 20 and 22 where \RCICO is high, \CI  and CO have similar line widths but the \CI  intensity is enhanced.$
$In NGC~4321 (Fig.~\ref{fig: NGC4321 line ratio map}), we mapped a smaller area due to its fainter CO brightness than NGC~3627. There are no regions with \Remark{CO21} integrated intensities >100  \Kkms outside our selected area in NGC~4321, whereas in comparison the NGC~3627 bar ends have \Remark{CO21} integrated intensities \gtrsim 300  \Kkms. The \CI  mapping in NGC~4321 has a similar depth as in NGC~3627.$
$We marked 7 regions in NGC~4321 to guide the visual inspection. A clear \RCICO  newcommandicit can be seen in the galaxy centre (Region 1), with \RCICO \sim 0.06, nearly a factor of two smaller than its inner disk which has similar \RCICO \sim 0.1 as seen in the NGC~3627 disk. Some \CI  enhancement can be found at the edges or slightly outside these regions, where CO and \CI  are both faint (\Remark{ICO21} \sim 30-100  \Kkms) and the edge effect of interferometric missing flux might play a role (see Appendix~\ref{appendix: simulation}).$
$The \RCICO  spatial distributions of the other two starburst/AGN galaxies (Fig.~\ref{fig: other line ratio maps}) show in general more enhanced \RCICO  than in the NGC~3627 and NGC~4321 disks.$
$Large variations from the centres to outer areas can be seen, especially at the the S/N threshold of \sim 3 \text{--} 5 (see contours).$
$To quantify the spatial co-localization of the \CI  and CO emission, we use the \incode{JACoP} tool \citep{JACoP} \footnote{\url{https://imagej.net/plugins/jacop}}$
$in the \incode{ImageJ} software \citep{ImageJ} to measure the commonly used co-localization indicators, namely the Pearson's coefficient (PC; equal to 0 and 1 for null and 100\% localization, respectively) and Manders' coefficients (M1 and M2; which measure the overlap between two images and are equal to one for perfect overlap). We turn on the option of using Costes' automatic threshold \citep{Costes2004} which automatically set a pixel value threshold for each image to minimize the contribution of noise for the comparison \citep{JACoP}.$
$For the \CI  and CO emission in our galaxies, we find \mathrm{PC/M1/M2} values all very close to 1, that is, nearly 100\% co-localization (\mathrm{PC/M1/M2} = 0.934/0.985/0.990 for NGC~3627, 0.816/0.986/0.964 for NGC~4321, 0.978/0.890/0.906 for NGC~1808, and 0.935/0.999/0.998 for NGC~7469).$
$Overall, the spatial comparison of the \CI  and CO intensities demonstrates that the two species are well-correlated when observed at hundred parsec scales.$
$Meanwhile, we do see certain spectral differences in the line profiles as shown in Appendix~\ref{appendix: all regions}. This may suggest that variations exist at smaller scales than our resolution, which could be the sign of different evolutionary stages \citep[e.g.][]{Kruijssen2014} and would be interesting for higher-resolution follow-ups, e.g., with the main ALMA 12m array.$

$\subsection{\RCICO versus CO surface brightness and gas surface density}$
$In Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO} we show the scatter points of \CI  and CO line brightnesses and the \RCICO  line ratios.$
$Systematic differences in \RCICO can be found among these galaxies and within their galactic environments. We discuss these environments separately as follows.$
$\subsubsection{Star-forming and starburst disk environments}$
$The majority of molecular gas in the 3--7~kpc star-forming disks of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321 exhibits a tight distribution of \RCICO around 0.1 (within about \pm50\%). The distribution is fairly flat over an order of magnitude in \Remark{ICO21}. We denote this as the "SF disk" regime.$
$The ratio rises to about 0.2 within a galactocentric radius of few hundred parsec to \sim 1~kpc starburst areas in NGC~1808 and NGC~7469, which we newcommandine as the "SB disk" regime.$
$The nearly flat "SB disk" distribution is consistent with earlier studies. \citet{Salak2019} found that in NGC~1808 \Remark{ICI10} is proportional to \Remark{ICO21}^{ +1.05}. They also studied CO(1--0), finding that \Remark{ICI10} \propto \Remark{ICO10}^{ +1.46}, i.e., with a steeper slope.$
$\citet{Saito2020} found a similar slope between \Remark{ICI10} and \Remark{ICO10}: \Remark{ICI10} \propto \Remark{ICO10}^{ +1.54} in IRAS~F18293-3413 (whose CO(2--1) data is insufficient for such a study as previously mentioned).$
$This correlation slope is likely to change with different CO transitions due to the CO excitation's dependence on the CO luminosity or star formation rate themselves (e.g., \citealt{Daddi2015,Liudz2021a}).$
$For higher-J CO transitions, \citet{Michiyama2021} studied \CI  and CO(4--3) lines in 36 (U)LIRGs, finding \Remark{ICI10} \propto \Remark{ICO43}^{ +0.97}.$
$The upward tails seen at the CO-faint-end in the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO} are mostly due to the detection limits in each galaxy. The color shading indicates the 5-\sigma limit for each galaxy, assuming a typical line width of 10~km~s^{-1}. Region~22 of NGC~3627 and the outer pixels in the two starburst/AGN galaxies make the tips of the blue and gray faint-end tails, respectively. But most of these features should still be spurious. We performed CASA simulations following the real observations of NGC~3627 to verify what we would get if \RCICO  were constant across the galaxies (Appendix~\ref{appendix: simulation})$
$We find that noise can indeed boost a simulated \RCICO  of 0.2 to a measurement as high as 0.5 in a NGC~3627-like large mosaic, or even higher to >1 in single-pointing ALMA data without total power or sufficient short spacing. However, the faint-end tail from the simulation is not very similar to that of NGC~3627, raising some questions about the nature of the high-\RCICO  in Region~22.$
$Furthermore, we also did stacking experiments using the CO line profile as the prior to measure the \CI  line fluxes in bins of CO line brightnesses or galactocentric radii. We find no systematically higher \RCICO  at fainter CO pixels or at the outer radii.$
$\subsubsection{Galaxy centre environments}$
$Most interestingly, the \lesssim 250~pc centres of all four galaxies show dramatically different \RCICO. It varies by a factor of ten from \sim 0.05 in the centre of NGC~4321  to \sim 0.1 in the centre of NGC~3627, then to \sim 0.15--0.2 at the centre of NGC~1808, and to \sim 0.2--0.5 in the nucleus of NGC~7469.$
$This "nuclei" trend has a slope of about 0.8, i.e., \Remark{ICI10} \approx 0.035 \; \Remark{ICO21}^{ +0.8}, and corresponds to a \Sigmol range of about 10^{3} to 10^{4} \; \Mspc2 if adopting an \alphaCO = 4.3  \mathrm{M_{\odot} \; (K   km   s^{-1}   pc^2)^{-1}} (\citealt{Bolatto2013}) and a CO excitation R_{21} = 0.65 (\citealt{Leroy2021c}).$
$The reasons for the nuclei showing this trend likely include both the effect of varying [\CI/CO] abundance ratio and the excitation and radiative transfer. They are determined by the actual ISM conditions in each environment, i.e., the gas kinetic temperature, \CI  and CO column densities (\CIcolumndensity and \COcolumndensity), line widths (\Delta{v}), and \mathrm{H_2} volume density (\nHtwo), etc.$
$They will be analyzed in Sect.~\ref{sec: Excitation Analysis}.$
$\subsubsection{Histogram and curve-of-growth of the line ratio distributions}$
$Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio histogram} shows the histogram and cumulative distribution functions of \RCICO (left panel) and the mean \RCICO and the 16-th to 84-th percentiles in bins of CO line intensity (right panel) in our galaxies.$
$The histogram is computed as the sum of CO line intensity in each bin of \RCICO, representing the amount of gas at each \RCICO.$
$The NGC~4321 histogram is lower than others, showing that it has the least total molecular gas mass among the four galaxies within mapped areas. The NGC~3627 histogram has a peak about 0.5~dex higher than that of NGC~4321, but their peak locations are consistently at \log \RCICO \sim -1, same conclusion as our previous scatter plots show.$
$The two SB galaxies NGC~1808 and NGC~7469, despite having much smaller observed areas (\sim 1--2~kpc), have more than an order of magnitude higher peaks hence total molecular gas masses.$
$The locations of their histogram peaks also shift to a systematically higher \RCICO.$
$It is clearly seen that both SF and SB disks lack a high-\RCICO (\log \RCICO > -0.35) gas component which dominates the gas in the strong AGN host galaxy NGC~7469.$
$The curve-of-growth in the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio histogram} further shows the cumulative CO brightness in bins of \RCICO, and reflects the fact that the majority of gas in our galactic disks has a narrow distribution of \RCICO (see also last few rows in Table~\ref{table: targets}).$
$In NGC~3627, NGC~4321 and NGC~1808, the higher- and lower-\RCICO gas outside \pm 0.1~dex around the mean \RCICO only sums up to <5--10\% of their total gas masses.$
$In the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio histogram}, we illustrate how the mean \RCICO changes with different gas surface density, as well as the scatter of the data point distribution. The 2D pixels are binned by CO brightness, and the mean and 16\%/50\%/84\%-th percentiles of the \RCICO are computed for each bin.$
$It sketches out the mean trends in Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO} (right panel), and also reveals that$
$a) the scatter of \RCICO is the largest (\pm 0.20~dex) in the starburst disk of NGC~7469 compared to other galaxies;$
$b) the scatter is the smallest (\pm 0.06~dex) in the star-forming disks of NGC~4321 and NGC~3627 where \Sigmol \sim 100 \text{--} 500 \; \Mspc2;$
$c) the scatters are very similarly (\pm 0.10~dex) at a relatively high \Sigmol \sim 1000 \; \Mspc2 in all our galaxies except for NGC~4321's centre.$
$\subsection{\RCICO versus ISRF}$

$\caption{$
$    Line ratio versus mean ISRF intensity \Umean measured from SED fitting to the near- to far-IR (\textit{Spitzer}, \textit{Herschel}) data.$
$    \textit{Left four panels} are the \Umean maps of NGC~3627, NGC~4321, NGC~1808 and NGC~7469, and as described in Sect.~\ref{subsection: ISRF} are obtained from the works done by J. Chastenet et al. (in prep.) as a continued effort of \citet{Chastenet2021}.$
$    \textit{Right panel} shows the scatter plot of \RCICO versus \Umean at a spatial resolution of \sim 18" in the manually-selected apertures shown in the left panels.$
$    We computed a beam-weighted mean \RCICO and a centre pixel \RCICO for each aperture, displayed as the solid and open symbols, respectively.$
$    Error bars are the corresponding beam-weighted mean or central pixel \RCICO  uncertainties in each region.$
$    The region diameter (\sim 18") corresponds to the coarsest resolution of the \textit{Herschel} data used in the SED fitting.$
$    The gray dotted line shows \RCICO = 0.07   U^{0.25} as a guiding line.$
$    The colored dotted contours (labeled 0.1--0.5) are the model contours of \RCICO computed from the PDR Toolbox (using the latest \incode{wk2020} model and solar metallicity; \citealt{Kaufman2006}). We convert G_0 from the model contour to the x-axis U by multiplying with a factor of 0.88 (\citealt{Draine2007}).$
$    The right y-axis indicates the PDR model's \nHtwo, whose range is manually adjusted so that the model contours roughly match the left x-axis.$
$    The PDR model contours show little dependence of \RCICO on U in the horizontal direction but a strong correlation with \nHtwo as seen by the vertical gradient.$
$\label{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}$
$}\vspace{1ex}$
$\end{figure*}$
$Here we study how \RCICO  correlates with the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) intensity (U; in units of Milky Way mean ISRF; \citealt{Habing1968}), which is a measure of the UV radiation field strength impacting the ISM. Since \CI  originates from PDRs, its abundance should be highly related to the PDR properties, thus whether or how \RCICO  correlates with the ISRF that illuminates the PDR is a key question.$
$The ISRF intensity U is usually measured by the re-radiated dust emission, as the original UV photons are highly attenuated by dust in the ISM. \citet[][hereafter DL07]{DL07} developed a series of dust grain models and synthesized SED templates that can describe nearby galaxies' observed dust SEDs. A number of studies (e.g., \citealt{Draine2007,Galliano2011,Dale2012,Aniano2012,Aniano2020,Daddi2015,Chastenet2017,Liudz2021a,Chastenet2021}) have used the DL07 models to fit the dust SEDs of galaxies near and far.$
$For our study, we adopt the mass-averaged ISRF \Umean maps from an ongoing effort by J. Chastenet et al. (in prep.) which is a continuation of the work published for other galaxies by \citet{Chastenet2017,Chastenet2021} with the same method.$
$In this method, the \textit{Herschel} far-infrared, \textit{Spitzer} and/or \textit{WISE} near-infrared images \footnote{For the two (U)LIRGs, the WISE maps are saturated, so their inferred ISRF intensity U should be considered with a large uncertainty.} are first PSF-matched to a common resolution \sim 18" (\textit{Herschel} SPIRE 250\mum), then SED fitting is performed using the DL07 models at each pixel.$
$Each dust SED is fitted by two dust components, one in the ambient ISM with a constant ISRF intensity U_{\mathrm{min}}, and the other in regions with higher U with a power law distributed ISRF from U_{\mathrm{min}} up to U_{\mathrm{max}} = 10^{7}.$
$The fitting then gives the best-fit U_{\mathrm{min}} and the power-law index \gamma of the U distribution.$
$The mean ISRF intensity \Umean is calculated as the dust mass-weighted mean of the ambient and power-law ISRF intensities (in DL07, U_{\rm PDR} \ge 10^2 is considered to be associated with the PDR), and better represents the overall ISRF than U_{\mathrm{min}}.$
$Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF} presents the \Umean maps and the \RCICO  versus \Umean scatter plot. Since the spatial resolution of the \Umean maps is 18", we calculate a weighted \RCICO in each circular aperture shown in Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF} whose diameter equals the \Umean map resolution, with weighting following the 2D Gaussian beam.$
$In addition, we also show the central pixel value for each region in Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}.$
$We restrict the analysis to regions where both \Umean and \RCICO  are measured.$
$A weak correlation between \RCICO  and \Umean is seen from the SF to SB disks, with a large scatter. For reference, we plot a \RCICO = 0.07   U^{0.25} line to indicate this weak trend. The lowest-\Umean data point in NGC~3627 (mainly Region~22) and the centre of NGC~7469 do not follow this trend, possibly indicating other \CI  enhancement mechanisms than \Umean.$
$We use the popular PDR modelling software, PDR Toolbox (version 2.2.9; \citealt{Kaufman2006,Pound2008,pdrtoolbox}) \footnote{\url{https://dustem.astro.umd.edu/}; \url{https://github.com/mpound/pdrtpy}.}$
$to compute the theoretical \RCICO in uniform grids of ISRF intensity in the \citet{Habing1968} G_0 unit and H nucleus density n_{\mathrm{H}} (both in log space). We adopt the latest \incode{wk2020} model set and a solar metallicity (\mathrm{[O/H_2]} = 3.2 \times 10^{-4}, \mathrm{[C/H_2]} = 1.6 \times 10^{-4}).$
$The ISRF intensity grid can be directly scaled to U by multiplying a factor 0.88 (\citealt{Draine2007}), corresponding to the x-axis of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}.$
$The n_{\mathrm{H}} grid is not directly linked to the left y-axis of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}, but because the model contours show fairly flat \RCICO versus U trends, we can match the model contours and indicate the n_{\mathrm{H}} grid in the right y-axis of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}.$
$The PDR modelling predicts generally flat \RCICO versus U trends similar to the distribution of the observed data points, although our U are diluted values at a much larger physical scale than in the PDR models.$
$However, in PDR models, \RCICO  changes moderately with n_{\mathrm{H}}, and a relatively high n_{\mathrm{H}} \sim 10^{3.5\text{--}3.7}   \mathrm{cm^{-3}} is needed to reproduce an \RCICO \sim 0.1--0.2, or equivalently \sim 1.0--1.9 for the ratio of \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO21} fluxes in \mathrm{erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} sr^{-1}} units used by the PDR Toolbox \footnote{See \url{https://github.com/mpound/pdrtpy-nb/blob/master/notebooks/PDRT_Example_Model_Plotting.ipynb}.$
$We scale the ratio of intensities in \mathrm{erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} sr^{-1}} to the ratio of intensities in \mathrm{K km s^{-1}} by a factor of (\nu_{\mathrm{CI10}}/\nu_{\mathrm{CO21}})^{-3} = 9.73, where \nu is the rest-frame frequency of the lines. We caution that the old version of \incode{PDRToolbox} \incode{v2.1.1} does not include the \incode{CI_609/CO_21} line ratio, but has \incode{CI_609/CO_43} and \incode{CO_43/CO_21} ratios. However, we tested that the multiplication of \incode{CI_609/CO_43} and \incode{CO_43/CO_21} does not produce the same result as the direct \incode{CI_609/CO_21} ratio in the new \incode{PDRToolbox} \incode{v2.2.9}. We use the new version for this work.$
$}.$
$Furthermore, the PDR model needs a \sim0.5~dex lower n_{\mathrm{H}} to explain the 2\times elevated \RCICO  in SB disks, which seems somewhat counterintuitive.$
$This apparent tension is likely caused by the observations probing a much coarser resolution that consists of a large number of PDRs with different n_{\mathrm{H}} and U (e.g., increasing U from 10 to 400 can increase \RCICO from 0.2 to 0.5 based on our PDR Toolbox modelling). It may also relate to an abundance variation driven by non-PDR mechanisms ---$
$X-ray dominated region (XDR; \citealt{Maloney1996,Meijerink2005,Meijerink2007}; see also review by \citealt{Wolfire2022}) and Cosmic Ray Dominated Region (CRDR; \citealt{Papadopoulos2010c,Papadopoulos2011,Papadopoulos2018,Bisbas2015,Bisbas2017}) are well-known to play an important role in starbursting and AGN environments, respectively.$

$As pointed out by \citet{Papadopoulos2011} and later works, ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with IR luminosities L_{\mathrm{IR, 8-1000\mu\mathrm{m}}} \ge 10^{12}   \Lsun and corresponding \mathrm{SFRs} > 1000   \Msyr have cosmic-ray (CR) energy densities \sim 10^{3} \text{--} 10^{4}\times larger than the Milky Way. In our sample, the two SB galaxies are not as intensively star-forming as ULIRGs, but their SFRs are still a factor of 2 to 20 higher than our SF galaxies. More importantly, the SB disks have considerably higher (e.g., one to two orders of magnitude) SFR surface densities than the SF disks, plausibly leading to a factor of a few tens to hundreds higher CR intensities. The CRs emitted from OB star clusters and supernova remnants can penetrate deeply into the ISM, and thus nearly uniformly illuminate the ISM and effectively dissociate CO into \CI .$
$A detailed simulation by \citet{Bisbas2017} showed that 10\times and 100\times higher CR ionization rates (\xi_{\mathrm{CR}}) than the Milky Way level results into a factor of about 2 and 3 mildly-increased \CI  abundance and about 1/2 and 1/30 strongly-decreased CO abundance, respectively (see their Fig.~3), in a 10~pc GMC with a mean gas density \left<n_{\mathrm{H}} \right>= 760   \mathrm{cm^{-3}}, resembling Milky Way and typical SF galaxies' ISM conditions.$
$Our SB galaxies probably have a \xi_{\mathrm{CR}} around or slightly above 10, but not reaching 100 given their mild \Umean \sim 20-30 compared to the \Umean \gtrsim 50 in extreme SB galaxies, e.g., local ULIRGs and high-redshift hyperluminous IR-bright (HyLIRG) and submm galaxies (\citealt{Daddi2015,Silverman2018,Liudz2021a}).$
$In Sect.~\ref{sec: Excitation Analysis}, we show that the mildly-increased [\CI/CO] abundance ratio from a CRDR and temperature/density-driven excitation can lead to the factor of 2 increase in \RCICO  when going from SF to SB disks.$
$\subsection{\RCICO versus Metallicity}$
$\label{subsec: metallicity}$
$Our current sample covers a relatively small range in metallicity for a metallicity--line ratio study. Given their stellar masses and metallicity maps (e.g., \citealt{Kreckel2019,Kreckel2020,Williams2022}), our targets probe a near-solar metallicity. NGC~3627 has a well-measured$
$metallicity gradient of Z = 8.53 + 0.06 \times[r/R_{25}] from \citet{Kreckel2019} \footnote{\citet{Kreckel2019} used a distance of 10.6 \pm 0.9 \; \mathrm{Mpc} for NGC~3627. We do not directly use this metallicity gradient, but use the metallicity maps from \citet{Williams2022} where the same new distance as in this work is adopted.}, but the metallicity of individual \ionizedhydrogen  regions scatter between \sim 8.45--8.65.$
$\citet{Williams2022} produced the 2D spatial distributions of gas-phase metallicity in PHANGS-MUSE galaxies, including NGC~3627 and NGC~4321, by applying the Gaussian Process Regression to map the smooth, higher-order metallicity variation from the individual, sparse \ionizedhydrogen  regions detected in PHANGS-MUSE (\citealt{PHANGSMUSE, Santoro2021}).$
$This method is significantly superior to a naïve nearest neighbor interpolation method. We refer the reader to \citet{Williams2022} for the technical details and validation demonstration.$
$In Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs metallicity} we present the trend between \RCICO  and metallicity in NGC~3627 and NGC~4321.$
$Due to our limited metallicity range, only a very weak decreasing trend can be seen.$
$A similar trend has been reported by \citet{Bolatto2000b}, who observed CO(1--0) and \Remark{CI10} in the Region N27 of the Small Magellanic Cloud and combined with literature data to present a correlation between \RCICO  and metallicity over \sim 0.2 \text{--} 2   Z_{\odot}.$
$We overlay the \citet{Bolatto2000b} empirical fitting \footnote{$
$We adopt the equation from \citep[][Fig.~2 caption]{Bolatto2000b}, with a typo-correction in the brackets so that the equations are:$
$\log ( F_{\Remark{CI10}} / F_{\Remark{CO10}} ) = -0.47   \left[12 + \log \mathrm{(O/H)} \right]+ 5.0 and \log ( F_{\Remark{CI10}} / F_{\Remark{CO10}} ) = -0.82   \left[12 + \log \mathrm{(O/H)} \right]+ 8.2, respectively, where F is the line flux in \mathrm{erg   s^{-1}   cm^{-2}   sr^{-1}}.$
$}$
$as well as a theoretical PDR model prediction line from \citet{Bolatto1999} in Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs metallicity}.$
$Although our data covers only a small metallicity range, it is encouraging to see the overall good agreement with the observationally-driven trend in \citet{Bolatto2000b}.$
$More detailed understanding of the deviation from PDR models will likely need more \CI  mapping in lower-metallicity galaxies.$

$\section{Estimation of abundance ratios under representative ISM conditions}$
$\label{sec: Excitation Analysis}$
$The observed \RCICO  depends on not only the \CI  and CO abundances (\COabundance  and \CIabundance ), but also the ISM conditions that determine the excitation (level population) and radiative transfer of the C atoms and CO molecules --- i.e., the gas kinetic temperature \Tkin, volume density of H_2 (\nHtwo; as the primary collision partners of C and CO), turbulent line width \dv, and the species' column densities \COcolumndensity and \CIcolumndensity.$
$The column density divided by the line width (N/\dv) further determines the optical depth \tau of each line.$
$In this work, having only a CO(2--1) and a \Remark{CI10} line is insufficient to numerically solve all the \Tkin, \nHtwo, \COcolumndensity/\dv, \COabundance  and \CIabundance . Therefore, we assume several \textit{representative ISM conditions} where \Tkin, \dv and \COabundance  are fixed to reasonable values, then solve the \COcolumndensity and \CIcolumndensity. We assume that \CI  and CO are spatially mixed at our resolution, i.e., they have the same filling factor. This is a relatively strong assumption and is likely not the real case, because although we see spatial co-localization at our \sim 200~pc resolutions, the spectral profiles of CO and \CI show discrepancies (Appendix~\ref{appendix: all regions}), indicating different underlying distributions at smaller scales. With the assumption of the same filling factor (and 3D distribution), the column density ratio \CIcolumndensity/\COcolumndensity equals the [\CI/CO] abundance ratio.$
$We perform both LTE and non-LTE calculations.$
$LTE assumes that all transitions are thermalized locally, and the level population follows Boltzmann statistics, so that each transition's excitation temperature T_{\mathrm{ex}} as newcommandined by the level population equals \Tkin (e.g., \citealt{Spitzer1998Book,Tielens2010Book,Draine2011Book}). The LTE assumption facilitates the computation as we do not need to solve the level population and thus \nHtwo is not used.$
$However, LTE is not easily reached in typical ISM conditions. Subthermalized lines need non-LTE calculations. The commonly adopted non-LTE approach is the Large Velocity Gradient (LVG; \citealt{Scoville1974,Goldreich1974}), where an escape fraction is used to facilitate the local radiation intensity calculation hence the detailed balance of radiative and collisional (de-)excitations.$
$We use RADEX (\citealt{RADEX}) to compute the non-LTE \CI  and CO line fluxes for each fixed parameter set (\Tkin, \nHtwo, \COcolumndensity, \CIcolumndensity, \dv), then study how [\CI/CO] determines the line flux ratio \RCICO.$
$We assume the following 7 representative ISM conditions:$
$\textit{(1)} inner Galactic GMCs,$

$Conditions \textit{(1)}--\textit{(3)} correspond to the "SF disk" in Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO}, and condition \textit{(4)} represents the "SB disk".$
$The last three conditions are for the "nuclei".$
$Under each ISM condition, we set a fixed \Tkin (in units of K), \dv (in units of km~s^{-1}), \COabundance , and \Sigmol (in units of \Mspc2).$
$The adopted values are shown at the top of each panel in Figs.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO} and \ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO}.$
$Our choice of \Tkin considered multi-line measurements in the literature, e.g., \citet{Heyer2015} for Galactic GMC ISM condition, and \citet{Teng2022} for NGC~3627 nucleus, as well as typical values in simulations (e.g., \citealt{Offner2014,Glover2015,Glover2016,Clark2019,HuChiaYu2021a}).$
$Our \dv is based on the observed line width in the highest-resolution ALMA data, i.e., from the original PHANGS-ALMA 1" data (\citealt{Leroy2021phangs}) or from \citet{Salak2019} and \citet{Izumi2020} for NGC~1808 and NGC~7469, respectively. The observed line width should at least new an upper limit, if not directly probing the turbulent \dv.$
$The \COabundance  is more like a fiducial value and does not obviously affect later [\CI/CO] results.$
$We also take a fiducial \Sigmol which matches the observed CO(1--0) line brightness temperature and a CO-to-H_2 conversion factor \alphaCO \sim 4 \text{--} 0.8 \; \mathrm{M_{\odot}   (K   km   s^{-1})^{-1}} depending on the assumed conditions (e.g., \citealt{Bolatto2013}; and our paper~II).$
$This \Sigmol directly converts to an N_{\mathrm{H_2}} if assuming that 36\% of the mass is helium. Then N_{\mathrm{H_2}} and \COabundance  together indicate a \COcolumndensity . Only with these assumptions can we unambiguously link an abundance ratio [\CI/CO] (i.e., \CIcolumndensity/\COcolumndensity) to a line flux ratio \RCICO .$
$Additionally, with the same filling factor assumption, \RCICOis also equivalent to the ratio of the CO-to-H_2 and \CI -to-H_2 conversion factors, i.e., \RCICO = \alphaCO/\alphaCI, because they trace the same molecular gas at our resolution.$
$In a companion paper (paper II; Liu et al. 2022 in prep.), we study the behaviors of \alphaCO and \alphaCI in more details, also under both LTE and non-LTE conditions.$

$    \label{fig: LTE RCICO}$
$\end{figure*}$
$We determine the LTE solution of [\CI/CO] in Fig.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}.$
$To illustrate the complexity of this problem and the degeneracy of the \Tkin, \COcolumndensity/\dv and [\CI/CO] parameters, we show how \RCICO (y-axis) varies with \RNCINCO (x-axis) and \COcolumndensity  (color bar) in the upper panels, and how \RCICO (contour) can be pinpointed by determining the \Sigmol (right y-axis).$
$At the top of each column the key parameters of the aforementioned representative ISM conditions are shown as text. The assumed \Tkin and \dv generally increase from panels (1) to (7) mimicking real conditions. Observational-driven \Remark{ICO10} ranges and the assumed \Sigmol for these ISM environments are also listed, and can be converted one into the other via \alphaCO. We also list the chosen \COabundance  for clarity.$
$As shown in the upper panels, \RCICO increases with both \RNCINCO and \COcolumndensity  under low-\Tkin conditions. However, a maximum \RCICO is reached in the high \CI  column density regime, where an increasing abundance ratio will no longer increase \RCICO. The line ratio saturates at about 0.5 when \Tkin \sim 15~K, or at about 1 for \Tkin \sim 100~K. The observed line ratios (horizontal dashed lines) are all lower than the saturation limit of \RCICO _{\mathrm{max}} \sim 0.7 \text{--} 0.9, and corresponds to a range of \COcolumndensity or \Sigmol. This range is very wide in the low-\Tkin conditions, with \log \COcolumndensity / \mathrm{cm^{-2}} \sim 17 - 19, but is very narrow at \Tkin \sim 100~K, that is, \RCICO can be determined from [\CI/CO] without much dependence on \COcolumndensity.$
$In the lower panels, the contours of \RCICO = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 are shown in the plane of CO column density \COcolumndensity versus \CI/CO abundance ratio.$
$For a fixed \RCICO , a higher \RNCINCO corresponds to a lower \COcolumndensity in the low-\Tkin regime, but \RCICO  becomes insensitive to \COcolumndensity at a high \Tkin. In the latter case, \RNCINCO alone determines \RCICO .$
$By matching to the expected \Sigmol for each ISM condition, we can obtain an unambiguous \RNCINCO from the observed \RCICO  as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}.$
$In this way, we determine the \RNCINCO to be around 0.1--0.2 for conditions \textit{(1)} and \textit{(2)}, and \sim 0.4 for conditions \textit{(3)} and \textit{(5)}.$
$The SB disk (condition \textit{4}) and AGN environments (conditions \textit{6}/\textit{7}) have \RNCINCO \sim 2 and \sim 1 \text{--} 10, respectively.$
$The strongly enhanced \CI/CO abundance ratios in SB disk and AGN environments are clear signatures of CRDR and XDR, respectively.$
$The NGC~4321 centre is a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER, e.g., \citealt{GarciaBurillo2005}), and given our assumptions it requires \RNCINCO \sim 0.4 in order to explain the observed low line ratio.$
$The gradually increasing \CI/CO abundance ratios in the nuclei of NGC~4321, NGC~3627, NGC~1808 and NGC~7469 agree well with the increasing power of AGN activities, e.g., their X-ray luminosities (Table~\ref{table: targets}).$
$Our assumptions for the Galactic cloud ISM condition are mainly based on \citet{Heyer2009}, \citet{Heyer2015} and \cite{RomanDuval2010}. The obtained [\CI/CO]~\sim 0.1 also agrees well with previous studies using \CI  and CO isotopologues (see Sect.~\ref{subsec: intro RCICO}.$
$For example, \citet{Ikeda1999} reported \RNCINCO \sim 0.05 \textnormal{--} 0.2 for the Orion cloud;$
$\citet{Oka2001} found \RNCINCO = 0.064 \pm 0.035 but a peak of \RNCINCO \sim 0.15 in the DR 15 \HII  region and two IR dark clouds;$
$\citet{Kramer2004} found \RNCINCO \sim 0.11 \textnormal{--} 0.12 in the massive SF region W3;$
$\citet{Genzel1988} found \RNCINCO \sim 0.2 for the massive SF region W51;$
$\citet{Zmuidzinas1988} reported \RNCINCO \sim 0.05 \textnormal{--} 0.15 in several dense clouds.$
$Recently, \citet{Izumi2021} derived an overall \RNCINCO \sim 0.1 in the massive SF region RCW38 at A_V \sim 10 \textnormal{--} 100, consistent with the Orion cloud, but also saw high [\CI/CO] \sim 0.2 \textnormal{--} 0.6 in some even lower column density regions.$
$Accurate determination of all the ISM properties instead of simple assumptions as in this work requires comprehensive, multi-J CO isotopologue observations (e.g., \citealt{Teng2022}).$
$Our representative ISM conditions only new a qualitative diagnostic to understand how to infer the \CI/CO abundance ratio from the observed \RCICO  quantity.$
$Their properties may not be very accurate, and are subject to change with future multi-tracer/CO isotopologue studies.$

$\subsection{Non-LTE results}$
$\label{subsec: non-LTE}$
$We perform the non-LTE calculations using the RADEX code (\citealt{vanderTak2007})$
$with the Large Velocity Gradient (LVG; i.e., expanding sphere) escape probability (\citealt{Scoville1974,Goldreich1974}).$
$Comparing to LTE, the volume density of H_2 is now an additional property that plays a role. The excitation temperature of each line no longer equals \Tkin.$
$We compute the non-LTE line ratios in a grid of ( \Tkin,   \dv,   \COabundance,   \RNCINCO,   \COcolumndensity,   \nHtwo ) parameter sets, then study the line and abundance ratios similarly as in the previous section.$
$In Fig.~\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} we show the non-LTE version of Fig.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}.$
$The non-LTE result does not qualitatively differ from that of LTE.$
$The most obvious difference is that at high temperature (\Tkin > 50~K, given our other assumed conditions), the required [\CI/CO] is lower by \times 2 for the same observed \RCICO, whereas at low temperature (\Tkin \sim 15~K) a \lesssim 2 \times [\CI/CO] is expected for the observed line ratio.$
$As listed in the title of each panel, we assume \log \nHtwo / \mathrm{cm^{-3}} = 2.5 to 3.0 for our conditions (1) to (7).$
$This is based on the fact that low-J CO and \CI  trace the bulk of molecular gas with \log \nHtwo / \mathrm{cm^{-3}} \sim 2--3 (e.g., \citealt{Leroy2017,Liudz2021a}), with a typical value \nHtwo \sim 300   \mathrm{cm^{-3}} widely adopted/found for Galactic and nearby galaxy GMCs (e.g., \citealt{Koda2012,Pety2017}, see also simulations of \citealt{Glover2012b}), whereas a smaller portion of their emission is from the dense gas with \log \nHtwo / \mathrm{cm^{-3}} \sim 4--6 (e.g., \citealt{Gao2004a}).$
$The fraction of the dense gas is expected to increase in more starbursting environment (\citealt{Gao2004b}), so does the mean gas density (\citealt{Liudz2021a}). Therefore, a \log \nHtwo / \mathrm{cm^{-3}} of 3.0 is perhaps a reasonable assumption, or at least a lower limit for our galaxy centres. A 10 \times higher density does not qualitatively change Fig.~\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} except for shifting the expected \RNCINCO to be 50\% higher in the \Tkin > 50~K conditions (making Fig.~\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} more like Fig.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}).$
$Therefore, our non-LTE result strongly confirms the LTE result in the previous section, that the intrinsic \CI/CO abundance has to vary significantly from about 0.1--0.2 to about 1--3, in order to explain the observed line ratios from Galactic GMCs (hundred pc scales) and NGC~3627/4321 SF disk GMCs to NGC~1808/7469 SB disk/AGN (r \lesssim 250~pc) environments.$
$\vspace{2ex}$
$\section{Discussion}$
$\label{sec: Discussion}$
$From this study we see that the line ratio \RCICO increases from 0.1 to 0.2 and > 0.5 from the SF disk to the SB disk and the vicinity (few hundred pc) of X-ray luminous AGN. Although we may be limited by our sample,$
$we suggest that this trend can be extended to general cases at both local and high redshift, because the \CI/CO abundance ratio enhancement is well-predicted by the CRDR and XDR theories.$
$\citet{Papadopoulos2010c} and \citet{Papadopoulos2011} pointed out the key role of CRDR in local (U)LIRGs. With UV photons alone, cold gas in starbursting environments can still be well shielded, hence as cold as \sim 10~K. However, with CRs produced from O, B star clusters and supernova remnants, the gas can be uniformly illuminated and heated up.$
$The extremely starbursty local ULIRGs have a CR density (\xi_{\mathrm{CR}}) 10^{3}--10^{4} times that of the Milky Way (\citealt{Papadopoulos2010c}), and thus will naturally dissociate more CO into \CI .$
$\citet{Bisbas2017} and \citet{Papadopoulos2018} conducted simulations of molecular gas at tens of pc scale with varying CR strength, and found that when \xi_{\mathrm{CR}} is \sim 1 \textnormal{--} 100   \times Galactic value, the gas temperature in the dense gas remains largely unaffected (\sim 10~K).$
$However, when \xi_{\mathrm{CR}} reaches \sim 1000   \times Galactic value as in (U)LIRGs, the gas temperature increases to 30--50~K. The \citet{Bisbas2017} simulation also shows that the \CI  and \ionizedcarbon  fractional abundances at \log A_V \sim 0.5 increase by one and three orders of magnitude, respectively, and the CO fractional abundance decreases correspondingly by over two orders of magnitude, with an increasing \xi_{\mathrm{CR}} from the Galactic value to 100   \times of that.$
$These results are in line with our calculations in Sect.~\ref{subsec: LTE}.$
$Meanwhile, the AGN-driven XDR chemistry and molecule/atom excitation have been firstly modeled in great detail by \citet{Maloney1996}, \citet{Meijerink2005} and \citet{Meijerink2007}. In XDRs, photo-ionization becomes the dominant heating source instead of photo-electric emission from dust grains in PDRs, thus more molecules are dissociated and/or ionized. \citet{Meijerink2005}'s Model~1 shows that CO molecules are fully dissociated when N_{\mathrm{H}} < 10^{23}   \mathrm{cm^{-2}}, then the fractional abundance is gradually increased by six orders of magnitudes from N_{\mathrm{H}} = 10^{23}   \mathrm{cm^{-2}} to 10^{24}   \mathrm{cm^{-2}}. By contrast, the \CI  and \ionizedcarbon  abundances are about constant until reaching the densest part (N_{\mathrm{H}} > 10^{24.5}   \mathrm{cm^{-2}}). Unlike in PDRs, there is no clear \ionizedcarbon /\CI /CO stratification in XDRs (\citealt{Meijerink2007,Wolfire2022}). Their Model~2 with a 100 \times higher energy deposition rate shows that the CO distribution contracts to the highest gas density spots, and the total cumulative [\CI/CO] is increased by about 0.2~dex, reaching \RNCINCO \sim 1.6.$
$This value agrees well with our calculations shown in Figs.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO} and \ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} (the ISM condition 7).$
$Therefore, both in theoretical and observational views, it is clear that the \RCICO line ratio is a good indicator of the starburst's CRDR and AGN's XDR.$
$If a \RCICO line ratio (to be specific, \Remark{ICI10}/\Remark{ICO21}) reaches 0.2--0.5, then the CRDR plays a crucial role and the abundance ratio [\CI/CO] could be \sim 1.$
$If it exceeds 0.5--1.0, then it may only be enhanced by an XDR, e.g., caused by an X-ray luminous AGN, which boosts the abundance ratio [\CI/CO] to \gtrsim 1--2.$
$\vspace{2ex}$
$\section{Conclusion}$
$\label{sec: Conclusion}$
$We presented new beam- and uv-coverage-matched \Remark{CI10} and CO(2--1) maps in the galactocentric radius r \lesssim 7~kpc SF disk of NGC~3627 at \sim 190~pc resolution, and in the r \lesssim 3~kpc disk of NGC~4321 at \sim 270~pc resolution.$
$They are among the largest \CI  mosaic mappings available in nearby galaxies.$
$We combined the imaging of \Remark{CI10} and CO(2--1) in two nearby, more starbursty and AGN-hosting galaxies, i.e., NGC~1808 central \sim1~kpc, and NGC~7469 central \sim1.5~kpc at 140--160~pc resolutions.$
$Together, we studied the spatial distributions of \CI  and CO, and their line ratio \RCICO as functions of various galaxy resolved properties, including CO brightness (Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO}), ISRF \Umean (Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}), and metallicity (Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs metallicity}).$
$In order to obtain the underlying intrinsic [\CI/CO] abundance ratio from the observed line ratio \RCICO, we assumed 7 representative ISM conditions and did both LTE and non-LTE calculations.$
$\vspace{1ex}$
$We summarize our findings as below:$
$\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0ex,topsep=1ex,leftmargin=4ex]$
$    \item The majority of the molecular gas in the SF disks of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321 has a uniform \Remark{RCI10CO21} = 0.10 \pm 0.05.$
$    \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO21} exhibit very similar spatial distributions at our 140--270~pc resolution.$
$    \item The majority of the molecular gas in the SB disk of NGC~1808 has \Remark{RCI10CO21} = 0.20 \pm 0.05.$
$    This elevated line ratio compared to the SF disk is likely caused by a \sim 3 \text{--} 5 \times increased [\CI/CO] abundance ratio, based on our LTE and non-LTE calculations and parameter assumptions (Figs.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO} and \ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO}).$
$    \item The centres (r \lesssim 250~pc) of NGC~4321, NGC~3627, NGC~1808 and NGC~7469 show a strongly increasing trend in \Remark{RCI10CO21}, from 0.05 to 0.5, as a function of I_{\Remark{CO21}} --- i.e., \Remark{RCI10CO21} \approx 0.035   (I_{\Remark{CO21}}/[100\;\Kkms])^{0.8}.$
$    The inferred [\CI/CO] abundance ratio from our non-LTE calculation changes from \sim 0.2 to \sim 3, in line with the increasing X-ray luminosity of the centres/AGNs.$
$    \item The observed \RCICO versus ISRF trend is fairly flat, i.e., \RCICO  is insensitive to ISRF intensity changes, similar to the PDR model prediction calculated with PDRToolbox (although our resolution is much coarser than the physical scale of PDR models; Sect.~\ref{subsection: ISRF}).$
$    \item We find a \RCICO versus metallicity trend consistent with previous observations that covered lower-metallicity environments (\sim 0.2   \mathrm{Z_{\odot}}; \citealt{Bolatto2000b}), within the metallicity range (\sim 0.7 \text{--} 1   \mathrm{Z_{\odot}}) of our sample (Sect.~\ref{subsec: metallicity}).$
$    \item Our inferred [\CI/CO] abundance ratios agree well with the CRDR and XDR's theoretical studies.$
$    Given the drastically changed \RCICO , we propose that the \CI  to CO line ratio can be a promising indicator of CRDR (starbursting) and XDR (AGN). For instance, an observed line flux ratio of$
$    \Remark{RCI10CO21} \sim 0.2 \textnormal{--} 0.5 and \gtrsim 0.5 effectively indicates CRDR and XDR, respectively.$
$    \item We do not find ubiquitous "CO-dark", \CI -bright gas at the outer r\sim 1 \text{--} 3~kpc disks of NGC~3627 and NGC4321, nor systematic enhancement in \RCICO  at CO-faintest sightlines via stacking, mainly due to the incompleteness of our data.$
$    Nevertheless, a few sightlines, e.g., Region~22 in NGC~3627 show high \RCICO ~\sim 0.5 which do not fully comply with the noise behavior seen in our CASA simulations.$

$We present new neutral atomic carbon [C~\textsc{i}]~( ^3P_1~\to~ ^3P_0) mapping observations within the inner \sim 7~kpc and \sim 4~kpc of the disks of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321 at a spatial resolution of 190~pc and 270~pc, respectively, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) Atacama Compact Array (ACA).$
$We combine these with the CO(2--1) data from PHANGS-ALMA, and literature [C~\textsc{i}] and CO data for two other starburst and/or active galactic nucleus (AGN) galaxies (NGC~1808, NGC~7469), to study: \textit{a)} the spatial distributions of C~\textsc{i} and CO emission; \textit{b)} the observed line ratio \RCICO = I_{\mathrm{[C{\normalfont\textsc{i}}]}(1\textnormal{--}0)} / I_{\mathrm{CO}(2\textnormal{--}1)} as a function of various galactic properties; and \textit{c)} the abundance ratio of [C~\textsc{i}/CO].$
$We find excellent spatial correspondence between C~\textsc{i} and CO emission and nearly uniform \RCICO \sim 0.1 across the majority of the star-forming disks of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321.$
$However, \RCICO strongly varies from \sim 0.05 at the centre of NGC~4321 to > 0.2 \text{--} 0.5 in NGC~1808's starbursting centre and NGC~7469's centre with an X-ray-luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN).$
$Meanwhile, \RCICOdoes not obviously vary with \Umean, similar to the prediction of photodissociation dominated region (PDR) models.$
$We also find a mildly decreasing \RCICOwith an increasing metallicity over 0.7\text{--}0.85 \mathrm{Z_{\odot}}, consistent with the literature.$
$Assuming various typical ISM conditions representing giant molecular clouds, active star-forming regions and strong starbursting environments, we calculate the local-thermodynamic-equilibrium radiative transfer and estimate the [C~\textsc{i}/CO] abundance ratio to be \sim 0.1 across the disks of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321, similar to previous large-scale findings in Galactic studies.$
$However, this abundance ratio likely has a substantial increase to \sim 1 and \gtrsim 1--5 in NGC~1808's starburst and NGC~7469's strong AGN environments, respectively, in line with the expectations for cosmic-ray dominated region (CRDR) and X-ray dominated region (XDR) chemistry.$
$Finally, we do not find a robust evidence for a generally CO-dark, C~\textsc{i}-bright gas in the disk areas we probed.$

$\section{Introduction}$
$\label{subsec: intro RCICO}$
$\subsection{Neutral atomic carbon in the interstellar medium}$
$Neutral atomic carbon (C^0 or \neutralcarbon) is an important phase of carbon in the interstellar medium (ISM) besides ionized carbon (C^+ or \ionizedcarbon) and carbon monoxide (CO).$
$Its ^{3}P state is split into three fine-structure levels. The^{3}P_{1} \to  ^{3}P_{0} transition line at 492.16065~GHz,$
$hereafter \Remark{CI10}$
$, has an upper energy level of E_u = 23.620~K and a critical density of n_{\mathrm{crit}} \sim 1.0 \times 10^{3} \;\mathrm{cm^{-3}} (at a temperature of 50~K) \footnote{n_{\mathrm{crit}} \equiv A / \gamma, where A is the Einstein A coefficient for the transition and \gamma the rate of collisional de-excitation with hydrogen molecules, with values from \cite{Schroder1991} as compiled in the Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database (\citealt{Schoier2005}), \url{https://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~moldata/}},$
$and the^{3}P_{2} \to  ^{3}P_{1} transition line at 809.34197~GHz has E_u = 62.462~K and n_{\mathrm{crit}} \sim 3.4 \times 10^{3} \;\mathrm{cm^{-3}}.$
$Therefore, they are easily excited in the cold ISM environment.$
$Given the high abundance of carbon in the ISM, \neutralcarbon, CO and \ionizedcarbon  are the most powerful cold ISM tracers, and are the most widely used tools to probe cold ISM properties and hence galaxy evolution at cosmological distances.$
$The interstellar \neutralcarbon  is produced from$
$the photodissociation of CO molecules by UV photons and the recombination of \ionizedcarbon , both happening in photodissociation regions (PDRs; \citealt{Langer1976,deJong1980,Tielens1985a,Tielens1985b,vanDishoeck1986,vanDishoeck1988,Sternberg1989,Sternberg1995,Hollenbach1991,Hollenbach1999,Kaufman1999,Wolfire2010,Madden2020,Bisbas2021}, also see reviews by \citealt{Genzel1989,Jaffe1985,Hollenbach1997,Wolfire2022}).$
$In the simple plane-parallel (i.e., 1-D) PDR model, \neutralcarbon  exists in a layer where UV photons can penetrate through the molecular gas but cannot maintain a high carbon ionizing rate.$
$Such a layer is suggested to have an intermediate gas surface density (N_{\mathrm{H_2}} \sim 1 \textnormal{--} 4 \times 10^{20} \;\mathrm{cm^{-2}}), fairly cold temperature (10 to a few tens K), and moderate visual extinction (A_V \sim 1 - 4).$
$CO molecules dominate the more shielded interior of this layer and \ionizedcarbon  dominates the exterior.$
$Hydrogen molecules are gradually photodissociated to atoms across this layer (A_V \sim 0.1 - 4).$
$This plane-parallel scenario qualitatively explains the layered structure of the Orion Bar PDR in our Galaxy on sub-pc scales (e.g.,  \citealt{Genzel1989,Tielens1993,Tauber1994,Hogerheijde1995b,Hollenbach1999,Goicoechea2016}), and the \rho~Ophiuchi~A PDR in a recent study with an unprecedented resolution of 360~AU (\citealt{Yamagishi2021}), where the interplay between individual young, massive (O, B) stars and the ISM can be directly observed.$
$However, such simple models cannot fully explain molecular clouds. Plenty of observations in Galactic molecular clouds, \ionizedhydrogen  regions and star-formation complexes have revealed a widespread \neutralcarbon  distribution over most areas of molecular clouds on scales of a few to ten pc, and a relatively high \neutralcarbon  fractional abundance even at a large A_V depth > 10~mag (\citealt{Phillips1980,Phillips1981,Wootten1982,Keene1985,Keene1987,Jaffe1985,Zmuidzinas1986,Zmuidzinas1988,Genzel1988,Frerking1989,Plume1994,Plume1999,Gerin1998a,Tatematsu1999,Ikeda1999,Ikeda2002,Yamamoto2001,Zhang2001,Kamegai2003,Oka2004,Izumi2021}).$
$This observational evidence actually requires PDRs to be clumpy  (\citealt{Stutzki1988,Genzel1988,Burton1990,Meixner1993,Spaans1997,Kramer2004,Kramer2008,Pineda2008,Sun2008}), with a volume filling factor much less than unity (e.g., \sim 0.1 - 0.3; \citealt{Stutzki1988}), so that$
$UV photons can penetrate through most of the cloud, except for the densest clumps.$
$Therefore, the spatial co-existence of \neutralcarbon  and low rotational transition (low-J) CO lines can be well explained by such an inter-clump medium inside the molecular clouds.$
$Alternatively, cosmic rays (CRs) have also been proposed to be the reason for the \neutralcarbon -CO association as they can penetrate much deeper than UV photons into clouds, and thus more uniformly dissociate CO molecules into \neutralcarbon  inside clouds (\citealt{Field1969,Padovani2009,Papadopoulos2010c,Ivlev2015,Papadopoulos2018}).$
$\subsection{Variations of the \CI/\CO line ratio (\RCICO) in the literature}$
$Although the spatial distributions of \CI  and low-J CO emission resemble each other surprisingly well from molecular clouds to Galactic scales (e.g., across the Galactic plane; \citealt{Wright1991,Bennett1994,Oka2005,Burton2015}) and in external galaxies with spatially resolved observations (e.g., \citealt{Schilke1993,White1994b,Harrison1995,Israel1995,Israel2001,Israel2003,Zhang2014,Krips2016,Cicone2018,Crocker2019,Jiao2019,Miyamoto2018,Miyamoto2021,Salak2019,Izumi2020,Saito2020,Michiyama2020,Michiyama2021}),$
$their line intensity ratio, \Remark{RCI10CO10} = \Remark{ICI10} / \Remark{ICO10} \footnote{The line intensity I has brightness temperature units \mathrm{K km s^{-1}}.}, does vary according to local ISM conditions --- \CI  and CO fractional abundance (i.e., metallicity), excitation condition (e.g., excitation temperature T_{\mathrm{ex}} and optical depth \tau), and UV and/or CR radiation field.$
$At individual molecular cloud scales, \Remark{RCI10CO10} (or column density ratio) seems to vary from \gtrsim 0.5 (or \gtrsim 0.2 for column density ratio) to <0.1 with an increasing N_{\mathrm{H2}} and A_V, e.g., from cloud surface or PDR front to the interior \citep[e.g.][]{Frerking1982,Genzel1988,Oka2004,Kramer2004,Kramer2008,Mookerjea2006,Sun2008,Yamagishi2021}.$
$At sub-galactic scales, when individual clouds are smoothed out, \Remark{RCI10CO10} is found to lie in a narrower range of \sim 0.1 \text{--} 0.3. For example, across the Galactic plane, the ratio is found to change only slightly within a galactocentric radius of 3--7~kpc (\sim 0.08 \text{--} 0.12, overall mean = 0.105 \pm 0.004; \citealt{Oka2005});$
$whereas in the starburst galaxies like M~82 and NGC~253, \Remark{RCI10CO10} or the [\CI]/CO abundance ratio is a factor of 3--5 higher than the Galactic value (\citealt{Schilke1993,White1994b,Krips2016}).$
$Recent high-resolution (hundred pc scales) \Remark{CI10} mapping studies in the nearby spiral galaxy M~83 (\citealt{Miyamoto2021}) and starburst galaxy IRAS~F18293-3413 (\citealt{Saito2020}) reported tightly-correlated \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO10} emission, with scaling relations at hundred parsecs equivalent to$
$\Remark{RCI10CO10} = 0.14 \times (L^{\prime}_{\Remark{CO10}}/10^{6.0} [\Remark{Kkmspc2}])^{-0.13}$
$and$
$\Remark{RCI10CO10} = 0.21 \times (L^{\prime}_{\Remark{CO10}}/10^{6.8} [\Remark{Kkmspc2}])^{+0.54},$
$respectively.$
$The discrepant power-law indices reflects different trends in individual galaxies that are not fully understood.$
$Meanwhile, in the central \lesssim 100~pc of NGC~7469 close to the X-ray-luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN), \RCICO  is found to be substantially enhanced by a factor of >10 (reaching \Remark{RCI10CO10} \approx 1; \citealt{Izumi2020}; see also the Circinus Galaxy's AGN with \Remark{RCI10CO32} \approx 0.9 in \citealt{Izumi2018}).$
$Furthermore, in the low-metallicity Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) environments, a factor of 1.5 - 3 \times higher \RCICO  values have been found (\citealt{Bolatto2000b,Bolatto2000c}; see also other low-metallicity galaxies: \citealt{Bolatto2000a,Hunt2017}).$
$These studies indicate that \RCICO  is sensitive to ISM conditions among and within galaxies.$
$However, previous extragalactic studies are mainly focused on starburst galaxies and bright galaxy centres. How \RCICO  behaves across the disks and spiral arms of typical star-forming galaxies is much less explored. Whether \CI  can trace the so-called CO-dark molecular gas at a low gas density or metallicity is also still in question.$
$Understanding \RCICO  variation and quantifying the \CI  and \CO  excitation in extragalactic environments is now particularly important given the rapidly growing numbers and diverse galactic environments of \CI  line observations at cosmological distances (e.g., \citealt{Weiss2003,Weiss2005,Pety2004,Wagg2006,Walter2011,Danielson2011,AlaghbandZadeh2013,Gullberg2016,Bothwell2017,Popping2017,Yang2017,Emonts2018,Valentino2018,Valentino2020,Bourne2019,Nesvadba2019,Dannerbauer2019,Jin2019,Brisbin2019,Boogaard2020,Cortzen2020,Harrington2021,Dunne2021,Lee2021}).$
$\subsection{What drives \RCICO? --- the need for high-resolution mapping across wide galactic environments}$
$High-resolution mapping of \CI  and CO from disks and spiral arms of nearby galaxies is indispensable for understanding and quantifying the ISM \CI  and CO physics. In particular, the following questions will be answered only with such observations:$
$Do \CI  and low-J CO have the same spatial distributions across galaxy disks?$
$Does the \RCICO  line ratio vary significantly across galaxy disks?$
$How does the \RCICO  line ratio vary among different local galaxies?$
$How can the observed \RCICO  line ratio be reliably converted to the \CI  and CO column density ratio (i.e., solving their radiation transfer equations and level population statistics and obtaining optical depths and excitation temperature)?$
$Currently, high-resolution (hundreds of parsec scale) imaging/mapping of \CI  in nearby galaxies relies on radio telescopes at high altitudes, e.g., the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE, 10-m single-dish), Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX, 12-m single-dish), and is limited to the available weather conditions corresponding to the high frequency of \CI  lines. Therefore, only a handful of galaxies have been imaged/mapped.$
$These include NGC~6240 by \citet{Cicone2018}, Circinus Galaxy by \citet{Izumi2018}, NGC~613 by \citet{Miyamoto2018}, NGC~1808 by \citet{Salak2019}, NGC~7469 by \citet{Izumi2020}, IRAS~F18293-3413 by \citet{Saito2020}, NGC~6052 by \citet[][\CI  undetected]{Michiyama2020}, 36 (U)LIRGs by \citet{Michiyama2021}, M~83 by \citet[][mapped the centre and northern part with ASTE]{Miyamoto2021}, Arp~220 by \citet{Ueda2022}, and NGC~1068 by \citet{Saito2022a,Saito2022b}.$
$Nevertheless, all of these observations, except for M~83, targeted the centres of starburst, IR-luminous and/or AGN host galaxies. M~83 is the only typical star-forming main sequence galaxy having a high-quality \CI  mapping. However, its map is still limited to a quarter of its inner \sim3~kpc disk.$
$In this work, we present two new \CI  mapping observations with the ALMA Atacama Compact Array (or Morita Array; 7-m dish, hereafter ACA or 7m) in nearby spiral galaxies NGC~3627 and NGC~4321.$
$Our observations aimed at detecting \CI  in the disks, and thus are much larger-area and deeper than previous \CI  maps.$
$By further adding a starburst and an AGN-host galaxy from the literature into our analysis, we present a comprehensive study of the \Remark{RCI10CO21} line ratio (hereafter \RCICO; ratios of other \CI /CO transitions will be explicitly written otherwise) in nearby star-forming disk and starburst and AGN environments.$
$In order to quantify the \CI  and CO abundance ratio,$
$we have further calculated the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE radiative transfer of \CI  and CO under several \textit{representative ISM conditions}.$
$The results from this study could thus be one of the most comprehensive local benchmarks for understanding the \CI  and CO line ratio and abundance variations.$
$The paper, as the first one of our series of papers, is organized as follows.$
$Sect.~\ref{sec: Observations} describes the sample selection, observations and data reduction.$
$Sect.~\ref{sec: Results} presents the spatial distribution and variation of \RCICO.$
$Sect.~\ref{sec: Excitation Analysis} presents the analysis of \CI  and CO excitation and radiative transfer and thus the abundance (species column density) ratio.$
$In Sect.~\ref{sec: Discussion} we discuss various topics relating to the [\CI/CO] abundance variation, CRDR, XDR, and CO-dark gas.$
$Finally we conclude in Sect.~\ref{sec: Conclusion}.$
$Our companion paper~II (D. Liu et al. in prep.) presents the detailed radiative transfer calculation and \CI  and CO conversion factors, and is related to the abundance calculation in this paper.$

$\section{Targets and observations}$
$\label{sec: Observations}$
$\subsection{Target selection}$
$\label{subsection: Target Selection}$
$Our targets, NGC~3627 and NGC~4321, are selected from a joint sample of the PHANGS-ALMA CO(2--1) (\citealt{Leroy2021phangs}), PHANGS-HST (\citealt{PHANGSHST}), and PHANGS-MUSE (\citealt{PHANGSMUSE}) surveys, with CO line intensities and systemic velocities best suitable for ALMA Band 8 \CI  mapping.$
$The PHANGS-ALMA sample consists of 90 nearby star-forming galaxies initially selected at distances of 2 \lesssim d / \mathrm{Mpc} \lesssim 23, with a stellar mass \log (M_{\star}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}) > 9.75, and which are not too inclined and visible to ALMA. They represent the typical star-forming main sequence galaxies in the local Universe.$
$The PHANGS-HST sample \citep{PHANGSHST} is a subsample of 38 PHANGS-ALMA galaxies, providing high-resolution stellar properties.$
$The PHANGS-MUSE large program \citep{PHANGSMUSE} targeted a subsample of 19 PHANGS-ALMA galaxies suitable for VLT/MUSE optical integral field unit (IFU) observations, achieving similar spatial coverage as in PHANGS-ALMA and providing rich nebular emission lines, attenuation, stellar age and metallicity and H~\textsc{ii} region information (e.g., \citealt{Kreckel2019, Kreckel2020, Pessa2021, Santoro2021, Williams2022}).$
$For the legacy value, we selected our sample from the joint ALMA+MUSE+HST sample pool, considered CO surface brightness, mapping area, \CI  line frequency and the transmission in the ALMA Band 8.$
$In this work, we present the new \CI  data of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321.$
$Because of the ALMA Band 8 sensitivity and the expected fainter \CI  line intensity than CO, the \CI  mapping areas are smaller than their CO(2--1) maps, but they are still the largest (\sim1'-2.35') and deepest (rms~\sim0.04~K per \sim5~km~s^{-1}) \CI  mapping with ALMA.$
$Furthermore, in order to study the \CI  and CO in different galactic environments, we selected two starbursting and/or AGN-host galaxies from the literature whose ALMA \Remark{CI10} and CO(2--1) data are available in the archive: NGC~1808 \citep{Salak2019} and NGC~7469 \citep{Izumi2020}.$
$NGC~1808 has ALMA mosaic observations covering its \sim 1~kpc starburst ring, and NGC~7469 has ALMA single-pointing observations covering its inner \sim 3~kpc area.$
$\subsection{New ALMA ACA Band 8 observations}$
$\label{subsection: ALMA Band 8 Observation}$
$Our \CI  observations for NGC~3627 were taken under the ALMA project 2018.1.01290.S (PI: D. Liu) during June 3rd to Sept. 29th, 2019 with ACA-only at Band~8. The total on-source integration time was 30.8~hours. A mosaic with 149 pointings was used to map an area of 94" \times 136" at a position angle of -27^\circ, which covers the galaxy centre, bar and the majority of the spiral arms, and is about 1/3 of the full PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) map area.$
$The achieved line sensitivity per 5 \kms is 45--55~mK (107--130~\mathrm{mJy/beam}) across the \Remark{CI10} line frequencies with a beam of 3.46".$
$The \CI  mapping for NGC~4321 were taken under the ALMA project 2019.1.01635.S (PI: D. Liu; NGC~1365 is also partially observed for this project) during Dec. 3rd, 2019 to July 1st, 2021, also with ACA-only at Band~8. The on-source integration time reached 16.1~hours for the mapping of an area of 55" \times 42" with 23 pointings using the 7m array. The achieved line sensitivity is similar to that of NGC~3627.$
$More detailed information is newd in Table~\ref{table: targets}.$
$ACA (7m) was chosen to new a matched and slightly coarser synthesized beam (\sim 3"-4") than the PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) data. In comparison, the main 12m ALMA array in compact C43-1/2 configurations will result in a \sim 0.4"-0.7" beam and significantly miss large scale (>4-6") emission without ACA.$
$No total power observations were requested in our presented observation, therefore we matched the uv ranges of the raw CO(2--1) and \Remark{CI10} visibility data during our data reduction.$
$We verified that missing flux will not substantially (\sim 30\%) bias our analysis using three methods as detailed in Appendix~\ref{appendix: missing flux}. This includes a CASA simulation of visibilities mimicking our ACA mosaic observations in NGC~3627, from which we find a missing flux as small as 7\% in \CI-bright pixels and up to \sim 50\% in the faintest pixels (and mostly < 30\%).$
$Our data reduction follows the PHANGS-ALMA imaging and post-processing pipeline \citep[][]{Leroy2021pipeline}, including imaging and deconvolution, mosaicking, broad and strict/signal mask generation, and moment map creation.$
$The additional steps in this study are: (a) uv-clipping in the CO(2--1) data to match the uv sampling range of \Remark{CI10}; and (b) making a joint mask of the individual CO(2--1) and \Remark{CI10} masks then extracting the moment maps (in the joint broad mask) and line ratios maps (in the joint strict mask).$
$More technical details are newd in Appendix~\ref{appendix: data reduction}.$
$Our \Remark{CI10} and CO(2--1) line intensity maps, the line ratio maps and \textit{HST} images for the two PHANGS galaxies, NGC~3627 and NGC~4321, are presented in Figs.~\ref{fig: NGC3627 line ratio map} and \ref{fig: NGC4321 line ratio map}, respectively.$
$Our data cubes and moment maps are also made publicly available at$
$the PHANGS-ALMA CADC public repository \footnote{\url{https://www.canfar.net/storage/list/phangs/RELEASES/DZLIU_etal_2022}}.$

$\label{subsection: additional targets}$
$The NGC~1808 ALMA \Remark{CI10}, \Remark{CO10} and \Remark{CO21} observations are presented in \citet{Salak2019} and all are interferometry plus total power, i.e., 12m+7m+tp, thus having no missing flux issue.$
$To study the \CI /\CO  line ratio consistently with our main targets, we only used the \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO21} data.$
$We re-reduced the raw data under ALMA project 2017.1.00984.S (PI: D. Salak) with the observatory calibration pipeline, then imaged, primary-beam-corrected and short-spacing-corrected using the PHANGS-ALMA pipeline in the same way as for our main targets (Appendix~\ref{appendix: data reduction}).$
$Note that in this step we re-reduced and imaged the total power data with the PHANGS-ALMA singledish pipeline (\citealt{Herrera2020,Leroy2021pipeline}) and did the short-spacing correction with the PHANGS-ALMA pipeline right after the primary beam correction.$
$The properties of the final \CO -\CI  beam-matched data cubes are listed in Table~\ref{table: targets}.$
$The NGC~7469 ALMA data are presented in \citet{Izumi2020} and we used the archival raw data of \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO21} under ALMA project 2017.1.00078.S (PI: T. Izumi). These are single pointings toward the centre. \Remark{CI10} is observed with ACA 7m and \Remark{CO21} with the 12m array, both without total power. We re-reduced the data following the same procedure as for NGC~3627 and NGC~4321 with the PHANGS-ALMA pipeline.$
$Our re-reduced \Remark{CI10} and CO(2--1) line intensity and ratio maps for these additional galaxies are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig: other line ratio maps}.$

$\subsection{Spatial distributions}$
$In Figs.~\ref{fig: NGC3627 line ratio map}, \ref{fig: NGC4321 line ratio map} and \ref{fig: other line ratio maps}, we present the beam-matched \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO21} integrated line intensity maps and their ratio maps.$
$The \CI/\CO  line ratio map is computed only for pixels within the joint strict mask area of the two lines, as described in Appendix~\ref{appendix: data reduction}, representing high-confidence signals.$
$In NGC~3627 (Fig.~\ref{fig: NGC3627 line ratio map}), we visually marked 23 regions based on the \CI  and CO commonly-detected (\mathrm{S/N}>3), strict-mask areas for later analysis. Region IDs are sorted by their \Remark{CI10} brightness.$
$Region 1 corresponds to the galaxy centre, Regions 2 and 3 are the southern and northern bar ends, Region 4 is an offset peak next to the galaxy centre, and other regions are mostly on the spiral arms. Most of these regions show a similar \RCICO \sim 0.1, except for, e.g., Regions 20 and 22 which exhibit a somewhat higher ratio of \RCICO \sim 0.5. The edge of Region 4 also shows an enhancement of \CI  yet it is hard to tell whether this is physical or simply caused by edge effects, e.g., as seen in our simulations (Appendix~\ref{appendix: simulation}).$
$We also examined the integrated spectra of each region in Appendix~\ref{appendix: all regions}.$
$The \CI  and CO line profiles are not always well-matched in width and shape. In the galaxy centre (Region 1) and at bright bar-ends (Regions 2, 3, 5), \CI  and CO have similar line widths but \CI  has a lower intensity than CO, whereas in some fainter regions (9, 10, 13, 14), \CI  is narrower than CO and relatively weaker. In Regions 4, 20 and 22 where \RCICO is high, \CI  and CO have similar line widths but the \CI  intensity is enhanced.$
$In NGC~4321 (Fig.~\ref{fig: NGC4321 line ratio map}), we mapped a smaller area due to its fainter CO brightness than NGC~3627. There are no regions with \Remark{CO21} integrated intensities >100  \Kkms outside our selected area in NGC~4321, whereas in comparison the NGC~3627 bar ends have \Remark{CO21} integrated intensities \gtrsim 300  \Kkms. The \CI  mapping in NGC~4321 has a similar depth as in NGC~3627.$
$We marked 7 regions in NGC~4321 to guide the visual inspection. A clear \RCICO  newcommandicit can be seen in the galaxy centre (Region 1), with \RCICO \sim 0.06, nearly a factor of two smaller than its inner disk which has similar \RCICO \sim 0.1 as seen in the NGC~3627 disk. Some \CI  enhancement can be found at the edges or slightly outside these regions, where CO and \CI  are both faint (\Remark{ICO21} \sim 30-100  \Kkms) and the edge effect of interferometric missing flux might play a role (see Appendix~\ref{appendix: simulation}).$
$The \RCICO  spatial distributions of the other two starburst/AGN galaxies (Fig.~\ref{fig: other line ratio maps}) show in general more enhanced \RCICO  than in the NGC~3627 and NGC~4321 disks.$
$Large variations from the centres to outer areas can be seen, especially at the the S/N threshold of \sim 3 \text{--} 5 (see contours).$
$To quantify the spatial co-localization of the \CI  and CO emission, we use the \incode{JACoP} tool \citep{JACoP} \footnote{\url{https://imagej.net/plugins/jacop}}$
$in the \incode{ImageJ} software \citep{ImageJ} to measure the commonly used co-localization indicators, namely the Pearson's coefficient (PC; equal to 0 and 1 for null and 100\% localization, respectively) and Manders' coefficients (M1 and M2; which measure the overlap between two images and are equal to one for perfect overlap). We turn on the option of using Costes' automatic threshold \citep{Costes2004} which automatically set a pixel value threshold for each image to minimize the contribution of noise for the comparison \citep{JACoP}.$
$For the \CI  and CO emission in our galaxies, we find \mathrm{PC/M1/M2} values all very close to 1, that is, nearly 100\% co-localization (\mathrm{PC/M1/M2} = 0.934/0.985/0.990 for NGC~3627, 0.816/0.986/0.964 for NGC~4321, 0.978/0.890/0.906 for NGC~1808, and 0.935/0.999/0.998 for NGC~7469).$
$Overall, the spatial comparison of the \CI  and CO intensities demonstrates that the two species are well-correlated when observed at hundred parsec scales.$
$Meanwhile, we do see certain spectral differences in the line profiles as shown in Appendix~\ref{appendix: all regions}. This may suggest that variations exist at smaller scales than our resolution, which could be the sign of different evolutionary stages \citep[e.g.][]{Kruijssen2014} and would be interesting for higher-resolution follow-ups, e.g., with the main ALMA 12m array.$

$\subsection{\RCICO versus CO surface brightness and gas surface density}$
$In Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO} we show the scatter points of \CI  and CO line brightnesses and the \RCICO  line ratios.$
$Systematic differences in \RCICO can be found among these galaxies and within their galactic environments. We discuss these environments separately as follows.$
$\subsubsection{Star-forming and starburst disk environments}$
$The majority of molecular gas in the 3--7~kpc star-forming disks of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321 exhibits a tight distribution of \RCICO around 0.1 (within about \pm50\%). The distribution is fairly flat over an order of magnitude in \Remark{ICO21}. We denote this as the "SF disk" regime.$
$The ratio rises to about 0.2 within a galactocentric radius of few hundred parsec to \sim 1~kpc starburst areas in NGC~1808 and NGC~7469, which we newcommandine as the "SB disk" regime.$
$The nearly flat "SB disk" distribution is consistent with earlier studies. \citet{Salak2019} found that in NGC~1808 \Remark{ICI10} is proportional to \Remark{ICO21}^{ +1.05}. They also studied CO(1--0), finding that \Remark{ICI10} \propto \Remark{ICO10}^{ +1.46}, i.e., with a steeper slope.$
$\citet{Saito2020} found a similar slope between \Remark{ICI10} and \Remark{ICO10}: \Remark{ICI10} \propto \Remark{ICO10}^{ +1.54} in IRAS~F18293-3413 (whose CO(2--1) data is insufficient for such a study as previously mentioned).$
$This correlation slope is likely to change with different CO transitions due to the CO excitation's dependence on the CO luminosity or star formation rate themselves (e.g., \citealt{Daddi2015,Liudz2021a}).$
$For higher-J CO transitions, \citet{Michiyama2021} studied \CI  and CO(4--3) lines in 36 (U)LIRGs, finding \Remark{ICI10} \propto \Remark{ICO43}^{ +0.97}.$
$The upward tails seen at the CO-faint-end in the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO} are mostly due to the detection limits in each galaxy. The color shading indicates the 5-\sigma limit for each galaxy, assuming a typical line width of 10~km~s^{-1}. Region~22 of NGC~3627 and the outer pixels in the two starburst/AGN galaxies make the tips of the blue and gray faint-end tails, respectively. But most of these features should still be spurious. We performed CASA simulations following the real observations of NGC~3627 to verify what we would get if \RCICO  were constant across the galaxies (Appendix~\ref{appendix: simulation})$
$We find that noise can indeed boost a simulated \RCICO  of 0.2 to a measurement as high as 0.5 in a NGC~3627-like large mosaic, or even higher to >1 in single-pointing ALMA data without total power or sufficient short spacing. However, the faint-end tail from the simulation is not very similar to that of NGC~3627, raising some questions about the nature of the high-\RCICO  in Region~22.$
$Furthermore, we also did stacking experiments using the CO line profile as the prior to measure the \CI  line fluxes in bins of CO line brightnesses or galactocentric radii. We find no systematically higher \RCICO  at fainter CO pixels or at the outer radii.$
$\subsubsection{Galaxy centre environments}$
$Most interestingly, the \lesssim 250~pc centres of all four galaxies show dramatically different \RCICO. It varies by a factor of ten from \sim 0.05 in the centre of NGC~4321  to \sim 0.1 in the centre of NGC~3627, then to \sim 0.15--0.2 at the centre of NGC~1808, and to \sim 0.2--0.5 in the nucleus of NGC~7469.$
$This "nuclei" trend has a slope of about 0.8, i.e., \Remark{ICI10} \approx 0.035 \; \Remark{ICO21}^{ +0.8}, and corresponds to a \Sigmol range of about 10^{3} to 10^{4} \; \Mspc2 if adopting an \alphaCO = 4.3  \mathrm{M_{\odot} \; (K   km   s^{-1}   pc^2)^{-1}} (\citealt{Bolatto2013}) and a CO excitation R_{21} = 0.65 (\citealt{Leroy2021c}).$
$The reasons for the nuclei showing this trend likely include both the effect of varying [\CI/CO] abundance ratio and the excitation and radiative transfer. They are determined by the actual ISM conditions in each environment, i.e., the gas kinetic temperature, \CI  and CO column densities (\CIcolumndensity and \COcolumndensity), line widths (\Delta{v}), and \mathrm{H_2} volume density (\nHtwo), etc.$
$They will be analyzed in Sect.~\ref{sec: Excitation Analysis}.$
$\subsubsection{Histogram and curve-of-growth of the line ratio distributions}$
$Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio histogram} shows the histogram and cumulative distribution functions of \RCICO (left panel) and the mean \RCICO and the 16-th to 84-th percentiles in bins of CO line intensity (right panel) in our galaxies.$
$The histogram is computed as the sum of CO line intensity in each bin of \RCICO, representing the amount of gas at each \RCICO.$
$The NGC~4321 histogram is lower than others, showing that it has the least total molecular gas mass among the four galaxies within mapped areas. The NGC~3627 histogram has a peak about 0.5~dex higher than that of NGC~4321, but their peak locations are consistently at \log \RCICO \sim -1, same conclusion as our previous scatter plots show.$
$The two SB galaxies NGC~1808 and NGC~7469, despite having much smaller observed areas (\sim 1--2~kpc), have more than an order of magnitude higher peaks hence total molecular gas masses.$
$The locations of their histogram peaks also shift to a systematically higher \RCICO.$
$It is clearly seen that both SF and SB disks lack a high-\RCICO (\log \RCICO > -0.35) gas component which dominates the gas in the strong AGN host galaxy NGC~7469.$
$The curve-of-growth in the left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio histogram} further shows the cumulative CO brightness in bins of \RCICO, and reflects the fact that the majority of gas in our galactic disks has a narrow distribution of \RCICO (see also last few rows in Table~\ref{table: targets}).$
$In NGC~3627, NGC~4321 and NGC~1808, the higher- and lower-\RCICO gas outside \pm 0.1~dex around the mean \RCICO only sums up to <5--10\% of their total gas masses.$
$In the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio histogram}, we illustrate how the mean \RCICO changes with different gas surface density, as well as the scatter of the data point distribution. The 2D pixels are binned by CO brightness, and the mean and 16\%/50\%/84\%-th percentiles of the \RCICO are computed for each bin.$
$It sketches out the mean trends in Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO} (right panel), and also reveals that$
$a) the scatter of \RCICO is the largest (\pm 0.20~dex) in the starburst disk of NGC~7469 compared to other galaxies;$
$b) the scatter is the smallest (\pm 0.06~dex) in the star-forming disks of NGC~4321 and NGC~3627 where \Sigmol \sim 100 \text{--} 500 \; \Mspc2;$
$c) the scatters are very similarly (\pm 0.10~dex) at a relatively high \Sigmol \sim 1000 \; \Mspc2 in all our galaxies except for NGC~4321's centre.$

$    Line ratio versus mean ISRF intensity \Umean measured from SED fitting to the near- to far-IR (\textit{Spitzer}, \textit{Herschel}) data.$
$    \textit{Left four panels} are the \Umean maps of NGC~3627, NGC~4321, NGC~1808 and NGC~7469, and as described in Sect.~\ref{subsection: ISRF} are obtained from the works done by J. Chastenet et al. (in prep.) as a continued effort of \citet{Chastenet2021}.$
$    \textit{Right panel} shows the scatter plot of \RCICO versus \Umean at a spatial resolution of \sim 18" in the manually-selected apertures shown in the left panels.$
$    We computed a beam-weighted mean \RCICO and a centre pixel \RCICO for each aperture, displayed as the solid and open symbols, respectively.$
$    Error bars are the corresponding beam-weighted mean or central pixel \RCICO  uncertainties in each region.$
$    The region diameter (\sim 18") corresponds to the coarsest resolution of the \textit{Herschel} data used in the SED fitting.$
$    The gray dotted line shows \RCICO = 0.07   U^{0.25} as a guiding line.$
$    The colored dotted contours (labeled 0.1--0.5) are the model contours of \RCICO computed from the PDR Toolbox (using the latest \incode{wk2020} model and solar metallicity; \citealt{Kaufman2006}). We convert G_0 from the model contour to the x-axis U by multiplying with a factor of 0.88 (\citealt{Draine2007}).$
$    The right y-axis indicates the PDR model's \nHtwo, whose range is manually adjusted so that the model contours roughly match the left x-axis.$
$    The PDR model contours show little dependence of \RCICO on U in the horizontal direction but a strong correlation with \nHtwo as seen by the vertical gradient.$
$\label{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}$
$}\vspace{1ex}$
$\end{figure*}$
$Here we study how \RCICO  correlates with the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) intensity (U; in units of Milky Way mean ISRF; \citealt{Habing1968}), which is a measure of the UV radiation field strength impacting the ISM. Since \CI  originates from PDRs, its abundance should be highly related to the PDR properties, thus whether or how \RCICO  correlates with the ISRF that illuminates the PDR is a key question.$
$The ISRF intensity U is usually measured by the re-radiated dust emission, as the original UV photons are highly attenuated by dust in the ISM. \citet[][hereafter DL07]{DL07} developed a series of dust grain models and synthesized SED templates that can describe nearby galaxies' observed dust SEDs. A number of studies (e.g., \citealt{Draine2007,Galliano2011,Dale2012,Aniano2012,Aniano2020,Daddi2015,Chastenet2017,Liudz2021a,Chastenet2021}) have used the DL07 models to fit the dust SEDs of galaxies near and far.$
$For our study, we adopt the mass-averaged ISRF \Umean maps from an ongoing effort by J. Chastenet et al. (in prep.) which is a continuation of the work published for other galaxies by \citet{Chastenet2017,Chastenet2021} with the same method.$
$In this method, the \textit{Herschel} far-infrared, \textit{Spitzer} and/or \textit{WISE} near-infrared images \footnote{For the two (U)LIRGs, the WISE maps are saturated, so their inferred ISRF intensity U should be considered with a large uncertainty.} are first PSF-matched to a common resolution \sim 18" (\textit{Herschel} SPIRE 250\mum), then SED fitting is performed using the DL07 models at each pixel.$
$Each dust SED is fitted by two dust components, one in the ambient ISM with a constant ISRF intensity U_{\mathrm{min}}, and the other in regions with higher U with a power law distributed ISRF from U_{\mathrm{min}} up to U_{\mathrm{max}} = 10^{7}.$
$The fitting then gives the best-fit U_{\mathrm{min}} and the power-law index \gamma of the U distribution.$
$The mean ISRF intensity \Umean is calculated as the dust mass-weighted mean of the ambient and power-law ISRF intensities (in DL07, U_{\rm PDR} \ge 10^2 is considered to be associated with the PDR), and better represents the overall ISRF than U_{\mathrm{min}}.$
$Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF} presents the \Umean maps and the \RCICO  versus \Umean scatter plot. Since the spatial resolution of the \Umean maps is 18", we calculate a weighted \RCICO in each circular aperture shown in Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF} whose diameter equals the \Umean map resolution, with weighting following the 2D Gaussian beam.$
$In addition, we also show the central pixel value for each region in Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}.$
$We restrict the analysis to regions where both \Umean and \RCICO  are measured.$
$A weak correlation between \RCICO  and \Umean is seen from the SF to SB disks, with a large scatter. For reference, we plot a \RCICO = 0.07   U^{0.25} line to indicate this weak trend. The lowest-\Umean data point in NGC~3627 (mainly Region~22) and the centre of NGC~7469 do not follow this trend, possibly indicating other \CI  enhancement mechanisms than \Umean.$
$We use the popular PDR modelling software, PDR Toolbox (version 2.2.9; \citealt{Kaufman2006,Pound2008,pdrtoolbox}) \footnote{\url{https://dustem.astro.umd.edu/}; \url{https://github.com/mpound/pdrtpy}.}$
$to compute the theoretical \RCICO in uniform grids of ISRF intensity in the \citet{Habing1968} G_0 unit and H nucleus density n_{\mathrm{H}} (both in log space). We adopt the latest \incode{wk2020} model set and a solar metallicity (\mathrm{[O/H_2]} = 3.2 \times 10^{-4}, \mathrm{[C/H_2]} = 1.6 \times 10^{-4}).$
$The ISRF intensity grid can be directly scaled to U by multiplying a factor 0.88 (\citealt{Draine2007}), corresponding to the x-axis of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}.$
$The n_{\mathrm{H}} grid is not directly linked to the left y-axis of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}, but because the model contours show fairly flat \RCICO versus U trends, we can match the model contours and indicate the n_{\mathrm{H}} grid in the right y-axis of Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}.$
$The PDR modelling predicts generally flat \RCICO versus U trends similar to the distribution of the observed data points, although our U are diluted values at a much larger physical scale than in the PDR models.$
$However, in PDR models, \RCICO  changes moderately with n_{\mathrm{H}}, and a relatively high n_{\mathrm{H}} \sim 10^{3.5\text{--}3.7}   \mathrm{cm^{-3}} is needed to reproduce an \RCICO \sim 0.1--0.2, or equivalently \sim 1.0--1.9 for the ratio of \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO21} fluxes in \mathrm{erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} sr^{-1}} units used by the PDR Toolbox \footnote{See \url{https://github.com/mpound/pdrtpy-nb/blob/master/notebooks/PDRT_Example_Model_Plotting.ipynb}.$
$We scale the ratio of intensities in \mathrm{erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} sr^{-1}} to the ratio of intensities in \mathrm{K km s^{-1}} by a factor of (\nu_{\mathrm{CI10}}/\nu_{\mathrm{CO21}})^{-3} = 9.73, where \nu is the rest-frame frequency of the lines. We caution that the old version of \incode{PDRToolbox} \incode{v2.1.1} does not include the \incode{CI_609/CO_21} line ratio, but has \incode{CI_609/CO_43} and \incode{CO_43/CO_21} ratios. However, we tested that the multiplication of \incode{CI_609/CO_43} and \incode{CO_43/CO_21} does not produce the same result as the direct \incode{CI_609/CO_21} ratio in the new \incode{PDRToolbox} \incode{v2.2.9}. We use the new version for this work.$
$}.$
$Furthermore, the PDR model needs a \sim0.5~dex lower n_{\mathrm{H}} to explain the 2\times elevated \RCICO  in SB disks, which seems somewhat counterintuitive.$
$This apparent tension is likely caused by the observations probing a much coarser resolution that consists of a large number of PDRs with different n_{\mathrm{H}} and U (e.g., increasing U from 10 to 400 can increase \RCICO from 0.2 to 0.5 based on our PDR Toolbox modelling). It may also relate to an abundance variation driven by non-PDR mechanisms ---$
$X-ray dominated region (XDR; \citealt{Maloney1996,Meijerink2005,Meijerink2007}; see also review by \citealt{Wolfire2022}) and Cosmic Ray Dominated Region (CRDR; \citealt{Papadopoulos2010c,Papadopoulos2011,Papadopoulos2018,Bisbas2015,Bisbas2017}) are well-known to play an important role in starbursting and AGN environments, respectively.$

$As pointed out by \citet{Papadopoulos2011} and later works, ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with IR luminosities L_{\mathrm{IR, 8-1000\mu\mathrm{m}}} \ge 10^{12}   \Lsun and corresponding \mathrm{SFRs} > 1000   \Msyr have cosmic-ray (CR) energy densities \sim 10^{3} \text{--} 10^{4}\times larger than the Milky Way. In our sample, the two SB galaxies are not as intensively star-forming as ULIRGs, but their SFRs are still a factor of 2 to 20 higher than our SF galaxies. More importantly, the SB disks have considerably higher (e.g., one to two orders of magnitude) SFR surface densities than the SF disks, plausibly leading to a factor of a few tens to hundreds higher CR intensities. The CRs emitted from OB star clusters and supernova remnants can penetrate deeply into the ISM, and thus nearly uniformly illuminate the ISM and effectively dissociate CO into \CI .$
$A detailed simulation by \citet{Bisbas2017} showed that 10\times and 100\times higher CR ionization rates (\xi_{\mathrm{CR}}) than the Milky Way level results into a factor of about 2 and 3 mildly-increased \CI  abundance and about 1/2 and 1/30 strongly-decreased CO abundance, respectively (see their Fig.~3), in a 10~pc GMC with a mean gas density \left<n_{\mathrm{H}} \right>= 760   \mathrm{cm^{-3}}, resembling Milky Way and typical SF galaxies' ISM conditions.$
$Our SB galaxies probably have a \xi_{\mathrm{CR}} around or slightly above 10, but not reaching 100 given their mild \Umean \sim 20-30 compared to the \Umean \gtrsim 50 in extreme SB galaxies, e.g., local ULIRGs and high-redshift hyperluminous IR-bright (HyLIRG) and submm galaxies (\citealt{Daddi2015,Silverman2018,Liudz2021a}).$
$In Sect.~\ref{sec: Excitation Analysis}, we show that the mildly-increased [\CI/CO] abundance ratio from a CRDR and temperature/density-driven excitation can lead to the factor of 2 increase in \RCICO  when going from SF to SB disks.$
$\subsection{\RCICO versus Metallicity}$
$\label{subsec: metallicity}$
$Our current sample covers a relatively small range in metallicity for a metallicity--line ratio study. Given their stellar masses and metallicity maps (e.g., \citealt{Kreckel2019,Kreckel2020,Williams2022}), our targets probe a near-solar metallicity. NGC~3627 has a well-measured$
$metallicity gradient of Z = 8.53 + 0.06 \times[r/R_{25}] from \citet{Kreckel2019} \footnote{\citet{Kreckel2019} used a distance of 10.6 \pm 0.9 \; \mathrm{Mpc} for NGC~3627. We do not directly use this metallicity gradient, but use the metallicity maps from \citet{Williams2022} where the same new distance as in this work is adopted.}, but the metallicity of individual \ionizedhydrogen  regions scatter between \sim 8.45--8.65.$
$\citet{Williams2022} produced the 2D spatial distributions of gas-phase metallicity in PHANGS-MUSE galaxies, including NGC~3627 and NGC~4321, by applying the Gaussian Process Regression to map the smooth, higher-order metallicity variation from the individual, sparse \ionizedhydrogen  regions detected in PHANGS-MUSE (\citealt{PHANGSMUSE, Santoro2021}).$
$This method is significantly superior to a naïve nearest neighbor interpolation method. We refer the reader to \citet{Williams2022} for the technical details and validation demonstration.$
$In Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs metallicity} we present the trend between \RCICO  and metallicity in NGC~3627 and NGC~4321.$
$Due to our limited metallicity range, only a very weak decreasing trend can be seen.$
$A similar trend has been reported by \citet{Bolatto2000b}, who observed CO(1--0) and \Remark{CI10} in the Region N27 of the Small Magellanic Cloud and combined with literature data to present a correlation between \RCICO  and metallicity over \sim 0.2 \text{--} 2   Z_{\odot}.$
$We overlay the \citet{Bolatto2000b} empirical fitting \footnote{$
$We adopt the equation from \citep[][Fig.~2 caption]{Bolatto2000b}, with a typo-correction in the brackets so that the equations are:$
$\log ( F_{\Remark{CI10}} / F_{\Remark{CO10}} ) = -0.47   \left[12 + \log \mathrm{(O/H)} \right]+ 5.0 and \log ( F_{\Remark{CI10}} / F_{\Remark{CO10}} ) = -0.82   \left[12 + \log \mathrm{(O/H)} \right]+ 8.2, respectively, where F is the line flux in \mathrm{erg   s^{-1}   cm^{-2}   sr^{-1}}.$
$}$
$as well as a theoretical PDR model prediction line from \citet{Bolatto1999} in Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs metallicity}.$
$Although our data covers only a small metallicity range, it is encouraging to see the overall good agreement with the observationally-driven trend in \citet{Bolatto2000b}.$
$More detailed understanding of the deviation from PDR models will likely need more \CI  mapping in lower-metallicity galaxies.$

$\section{Estimation of abundance ratios under representative ISM conditions}$
$\label{sec: Excitation Analysis}$
$The observed \RCICO  depends on not only the \CI  and CO abundances (\COabundance  and \CIabundance ), but also the ISM conditions that determine the excitation (level population) and radiative transfer of the C atoms and CO molecules --- i.e., the gas kinetic temperature \Tkin, volume density of H_2 (\nHtwo; as the primary collision partners of C and CO), turbulent line width \dv, and the species' column densities \COcolumndensity and \CIcolumndensity.$
$The column density divided by the line width (N/\dv) further determines the optical depth \tau of each line.$
$In this work, having only a CO(2--1) and a \Remark{CI10} line is insufficient to numerically solve all the \Tkin, \nHtwo, \COcolumndensity/\dv, \COabundance  and \CIabundance . Therefore, we assume several \textit{representative ISM conditions} where \Tkin, \dv and \COabundance  are fixed to reasonable values, then solve the \COcolumndensity and \CIcolumndensity. We assume that \CI  and CO are spatially mixed at our resolution, i.e., they have the same filling factor. This is a relatively strong assumption and is likely not the real case, because although we see spatial co-localization at our \sim 200~pc resolutions, the spectral profiles of CO and \CI show discrepancies (Appendix~\ref{appendix: all regions}), indicating different underlying distributions at smaller scales. With the assumption of the same filling factor (and 3D distribution), the column density ratio \CIcolumndensity/\COcolumndensity equals the [\CI/CO] abundance ratio.$
$We perform both LTE and non-LTE calculations.$
$LTE assumes that all transitions are thermalized locally, and the level population follows Boltzmann statistics, so that each transition's excitation temperature T_{\mathrm{ex}} as newcommandined by the level population equals \Tkin (e.g., \citealt{Spitzer1998Book,Tielens2010Book,Draine2011Book}). The LTE assumption facilitates the computation as we do not need to solve the level population and thus \nHtwo is not used.$
$However, LTE is not easily reached in typical ISM conditions. Subthermalized lines need non-LTE calculations. The commonly adopted non-LTE approach is the Large Velocity Gradient (LVG; \citealt{Scoville1974,Goldreich1974}), where an escape fraction is used to facilitate the local radiation intensity calculation hence the detailed balance of radiative and collisional (de-)excitations.$
$We use RADEX (\citealt{RADEX}) to compute the non-LTE \CI  and CO line fluxes for each fixed parameter set (\Tkin, \nHtwo, \COcolumndensity, \CIcolumndensity, \dv), then study how [\CI/CO] determines the line flux ratio \RCICO.$
$We assume the following 7 representative ISM conditions:$
$\textit{(1)} inner Galactic GMCs,$
$\textit{(2)} NGC~3627/4321 disk GMCs,$
$\textit{(3)} NGC~3627 bar-end environments,$
$\textit{(4)} NGC~1808/7469 SB disk,$
$\textit{(5)} NGC~4321 centre,$
$\textit{(6)} NGC~3627 centre,$
$and \textit{(7)} NGC~7469 centre.$
$Conditions \textit{(1)}--\textit{(3)} correspond to the "SF disk" in Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO}, and condition \textit{(4)} represents the "SB disk".$
$The last three conditions are for the "nuclei".$
$Under each ISM condition, we set a fixed \Tkin (in units of K), \dv (in units of km~s^{-1}), \COabundance , and \Sigmol (in units of \Mspc2).$
$The adopted values are shown at the top of each panel in Figs.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO} and \ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO}.$
$Our choice of \Tkin considered multi-line measurements in the literature, e.g., \citet{Heyer2015} for Galactic GMC ISM condition, and \citet{Teng2022} for NGC~3627 nucleus, as well as typical values in simulations (e.g., \citealt{Offner2014,Glover2015,Glover2016,Clark2019,HuChiaYu2021a}).$
$Our \dv is based on the observed line width in the highest-resolution ALMA data, i.e., from the original PHANGS-ALMA 1" data (\citealt{Leroy2021phangs}) or from \citet{Salak2019} and \citet{Izumi2020} for NGC~1808 and NGC~7469, respectively. The observed line width should at least new an upper limit, if not directly probing the turbulent \dv.$
$The \COabundance  is more like a fiducial value and does not obviously affect later [\CI/CO] results.$
$We also take a fiducial \Sigmol which matches the observed CO(1--0) line brightness temperature and a CO-to-H_2 conversion factor \alphaCO \sim 4 \text{--} 0.8 \; \mathrm{M_{\odot}   (K   km   s^{-1})^{-1}} depending on the assumed conditions (e.g., \citealt{Bolatto2013}; and our paper~II).$
$This \Sigmol directly converts to an N_{\mathrm{H_2}} if assuming that 36\% of the mass is helium. Then N_{\mathrm{H_2}} and \COabundance  together indicate a \COcolumndensity . Only with these assumptions can we unambiguously link an abundance ratio [\CI/CO] (i.e., \CIcolumndensity/\COcolumndensity) to a line flux ratio \RCICO .$
$Additionally, with the same filling factor assumption, \RCICOis also equivalent to the ratio of the CO-to-H_2 and \CI -to-H_2 conversion factors, i.e., \RCICO = \alphaCO/\alphaCI, because they trace the same molecular gas at our resolution.$
$In a companion paper (paper II; Liu et al. 2022 in prep.), we study the behaviors of \alphaCO and \alphaCI in more details, also under both LTE and non-LTE conditions.$

$We determine the LTE solution of [\CI/CO] in Fig.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}.$
$To illustrate the complexity of this problem and the degeneracy of the \Tkin, \COcolumndensity/\dv and [\CI/CO] parameters, we show how \RCICO (y-axis) varies with \RNCINCO (x-axis) and \COcolumndensity  (color bar) in the upper panels, and how \RCICO (contour) can be pinpointed by determining the \Sigmol (right y-axis).$
$At the top of each column the key parameters of the aforementioned representative ISM conditions are shown as text. The assumed \Tkin and \dv generally increase from panels (1) to (7) mimicking real conditions. Observational-driven \Remark{ICO10} ranges and the assumed \Sigmol for these ISM environments are also listed, and can be converted one into the other via \alphaCO. We also list the chosen \COabundance  for clarity.$
$As shown in the upper panels, \RCICO increases with both \RNCINCO and \COcolumndensity  under low-\Tkin conditions. However, a maximum \RCICO is reached in the high \CI  column density regime, where an increasing abundance ratio will no longer increase \RCICO. The line ratio saturates at about 0.5 when \Tkin \sim 15~K, or at about 1 for \Tkin \sim 100~K. The observed line ratios (horizontal dashed lines) are all lower than the saturation limit of \RCICO _{\mathrm{max}} \sim 0.7 \text{--} 0.9, and corresponds to a range of \COcolumndensity or \Sigmol. This range is very wide in the low-\Tkin conditions, with \log \COcolumndensity / \mathrm{cm^{-2}} \sim 17 - 19, but is very narrow at \Tkin \sim 100~K, that is, \RCICO can be determined from [\CI/CO] without much dependence on \COcolumndensity.$
$In the lower panels, the contours of \RCICO = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 are shown in the plane of CO column density \COcolumndensity versus \CI/CO abundance ratio.$
$For a fixed \RCICO , a higher \RNCINCO corresponds to a lower \COcolumndensity in the low-\Tkin regime, but \RCICO  becomes insensitive to \COcolumndensity at a high \Tkin. In the latter case, \RNCINCO alone determines \RCICO .$
$By matching to the expected \Sigmol for each ISM condition, we can obtain an unambiguous \RNCINCO from the observed \RCICO  as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}.$
$In this way, we determine the \RNCINCO to be around 0.1--0.2 for conditions \textit{(1)} and \textit{(2)}, and \sim 0.4 for conditions \textit{(3)} and \textit{(5)}.$
$The SB disk (condition \textit{4}) and AGN environments (conditions \textit{6}/\textit{7}) have \RNCINCO \sim 2 and \sim 1 \text{--} 10, respectively.$
$The strongly enhanced \CI/CO abundance ratios in SB disk and AGN environments are clear signatures of CRDR and XDR, respectively.$
$The NGC~4321 centre is a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER, e.g., \citealt{GarciaBurillo2005}), and given our assumptions it requires \RNCINCO \sim 0.4 in order to explain the observed low line ratio.$
$The gradually increasing \CI/CO abundance ratios in the nuclei of NGC~4321, NGC~3627, NGC~1808 and NGC~7469 agree well with the increasing power of AGN activities, e.g., their X-ray luminosities (Table~\ref{table: targets}).$
$Our assumptions for the Galactic cloud ISM condition are mainly based on \citet{Heyer2009}, \citet{Heyer2015} and \cite{RomanDuval2010}. The obtained [\CI/CO]~\sim 0.1 also agrees well with previous studies using \CI  and CO isotopologues (see Sect.~\ref{subsec: intro RCICO}.$
$For example, \citet{Ikeda1999} reported \RNCINCO \sim 0.05 \textnormal{--} 0.2 for the Orion cloud;$
$\citet{Oka2001} found \RNCINCO = 0.064 \pm 0.035 but a peak of \RNCINCO \sim 0.15 in the DR 15 \HII  region and two IR dark clouds;$
$\citet{Kramer2004} found \RNCINCO \sim 0.11 \textnormal{--} 0.12 in the massive SF region W3;$
$\citet{Genzel1988} found \RNCINCO \sim 0.2 for the massive SF region W51;$
$\citet{Zmuidzinas1988} reported \RNCINCO \sim 0.05 \textnormal{--} 0.15 in several dense clouds.$
$Recently, \citet{Izumi2021} derived an overall \RNCINCO \sim 0.1 in the massive SF region RCW38 at A_V \sim 10 \textnormal{--} 100, consistent with the Orion cloud, but also saw high [\CI/CO] \sim 0.2 \textnormal{--} 0.6 in some even lower column density regions.$
$Accurate determination of all the ISM properties instead of simple assumptions as in this work requires comprehensive, multi-J CO isotopologue observations (e.g., \citealt{Teng2022}).$
$Our representative ISM conditions only new a qualitative diagnostic to understand how to infer the \CI/CO abundance ratio from the observed \RCICO  quantity.$
$Their properties may not be very accurate, and are subject to change with future multi-tracer/CO isotopologue studies.$

$\subsection{Non-LTE results}$
$\label{subsec: non-LTE}$
$We perform the non-LTE calculations using the RADEX code (\citealt{vanderTak2007})$
$with the Large Velocity Gradient (LVG; i.e., expanding sphere) escape probability (\citealt{Scoville1974,Goldreich1974}).$
$Comparing to LTE, the volume density of H_2 is now an additional property that plays a role. The excitation temperature of each line no longer equals \Tkin.$
$We compute the non-LTE line ratios in a grid of ( \Tkin,   \dv,   \COabundance,   \RNCINCO,   \COcolumndensity,   \nHtwo ) parameter sets, then study the line and abundance ratios similarly as in the previous section.$
$In Fig.~\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} we show the non-LTE version of Fig.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}.$
$The non-LTE result does not qualitatively differ from that of LTE.$
$The most obvious difference is that at high temperature (\Tkin > 50~K, given our other assumed conditions), the required [\CI/CO] is lower by \times 2 for the same observed \RCICO, whereas at low temperature (\Tkin \sim 15~K) a \lesssim 2 \times [\CI/CO] is expected for the observed line ratio.$
$As listed in the title of each panel, we assume \log \nHtwo / \mathrm{cm^{-3}} = 2.5 to 3.0 for our conditions (1) to (7).$
$This is based on the fact that low-J CO and \CI  trace the bulk of molecular gas with \log \nHtwo / \mathrm{cm^{-3}} \sim 2--3 (e.g., \citealt{Leroy2017,Liudz2021a}), with a typical value \nHtwo \sim 300   \mathrm{cm^{-3}} widely adopted/found for Galactic and nearby galaxy GMCs (e.g., \citealt{Koda2012,Pety2017}, see also simulations of \citealt{Glover2012b}), whereas a smaller portion of their emission is from the dense gas with \log \nHtwo / \mathrm{cm^{-3}} \sim 4--6 (e.g., \citealt{Gao2004a}).$
$The fraction of the dense gas is expected to increase in more starbursting environment (\citealt{Gao2004b}), so does the mean gas density (\citealt{Liudz2021a}). Therefore, a \log \nHtwo / \mathrm{cm^{-3}} of 3.0 is perhaps a reasonable assumption, or at least a lower limit for our galaxy centres. A 10 \times higher density does not qualitatively change Fig.~\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} except for shifting the expected \RNCINCO to be 50\% higher in the \Tkin > 50~K conditions (making Fig.~\ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} more like Fig.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO}).$
$Therefore, our non-LTE result strongly confirms the LTE result in the previous section, that the intrinsic \CI/CO abundance has to vary significantly from about 0.1--0.2 to about 1--3, in order to explain the observed line ratios from Galactic GMCs (hundred pc scales) and NGC~3627/4321 SF disk GMCs to NGC~1808/7469 SB disk/AGN (r \lesssim 250~pc) environments.$
$\vspace{2ex}$
$\section{Discussion}$
$\label{sec: Discussion}$
$From this study we see that the line ratio \RCICO increases from 0.1 to 0.2 and > 0.5 from the SF disk to the SB disk and the vicinity (few hundred pc) of X-ray luminous AGN. Although we may be limited by our sample,$
$we suggest that this trend can be extended to general cases at both local and high redshift, because the \CI/CO abundance ratio enhancement is well-predicted by the CRDR and XDR theories.$
$\citet{Papadopoulos2010c} and \citet{Papadopoulos2011} pointed out the key role of CRDR in local (U)LIRGs. With UV photons alone, cold gas in starbursting environments can still be well shielded, hence as cold as \sim 10~K. However, with CRs produced from O, B star clusters and supernova remnants, the gas can be uniformly illuminated and heated up.$
$The extremely starbursty local ULIRGs have a CR density (\xi_{\mathrm{CR}}) 10^{3}--10^{4} times that of the Milky Way (\citealt{Papadopoulos2010c}), and thus will naturally dissociate more CO into \CI .$
$\citet{Bisbas2017} and \citet{Papadopoulos2018} conducted simulations of molecular gas at tens of pc scale with varying CR strength, and found that when \xi_{\mathrm{CR}} is \sim 1 \textnormal{--} 100   \times Galactic value, the gas temperature in the dense gas remains largely unaffected (\sim 10~K).$
$However, when \xi_{\mathrm{CR}} reaches \sim 1000   \times Galactic value as in (U)LIRGs, the gas temperature increases to 30--50~K. The \citet{Bisbas2017} simulation also shows that the \CI  and \ionizedcarbon  fractional abundances at \log A_V \sim 0.5 increase by one and three orders of magnitude, respectively, and the CO fractional abundance decreases correspondingly by over two orders of magnitude, with an increasing \xi_{\mathrm{CR}} from the Galactic value to 100   \times of that.$
$These results are in line with our calculations in Sect.~\ref{subsec: LTE}.$
$Meanwhile, the AGN-driven XDR chemistry and molecule/atom excitation have been firstly modeled in great detail by \citet{Maloney1996}, \citet{Meijerink2005} and \citet{Meijerink2007}. In XDRs, photo-ionization becomes the dominant heating source instead of photo-electric emission from dust grains in PDRs, thus more molecules are dissociated and/or ionized. \citet{Meijerink2005}'s Model~1 shows that CO molecules are fully dissociated when N_{\mathrm{H}} < 10^{23}   \mathrm{cm^{-2}}, then the fractional abundance is gradually increased by six orders of magnitudes from N_{\mathrm{H}} = 10^{23}   \mathrm{cm^{-2}} to 10^{24}   \mathrm{cm^{-2}}. By contrast, the \CI  and \ionizedcarbon  abundances are about constant until reaching the densest part (N_{\mathrm{H}} > 10^{24.5}   \mathrm{cm^{-2}}). Unlike in PDRs, there is no clear \ionizedcarbon /\CI /CO stratification in XDRs (\citealt{Meijerink2007,Wolfire2022}). Their Model~2 with a 100 \times higher energy deposition rate shows that the CO distribution contracts to the highest gas density spots, and the total cumulative [\CI/CO] is increased by about 0.2~dex, reaching \RNCINCO \sim 1.6.$
$This value agrees well with our calculations shown in Figs.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO} and \ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO} (the ISM condition 7).$
$Therefore, both in theoretical and observational views, it is clear that the \RCICO line ratio is a good indicator of the starburst's CRDR and AGN's XDR.$
$If a \RCICO line ratio (to be specific, \Remark{ICI10}/\Remark{ICO21}) reaches 0.2--0.5, then the CRDR plays a crucial role and the abundance ratio [\CI/CO] could be \sim 1.$
$If it exceeds 0.5--1.0, then it may only be enhanced by an XDR, e.g., caused by an X-ray luminous AGN, which boosts the abundance ratio [\CI/CO] to \gtrsim 1--2.$

$\section{Conclusion}$
$\label{sec: Conclusion}$
$We presented new beam- and uv-coverage-matched \Remark{CI10} and CO(2--1) maps in the galactocentric radius r \lesssim 7~kpc SF disk of NGC~3627 at \sim 190~pc resolution, and in the r \lesssim 3~kpc disk of NGC~4321 at \sim 270~pc resolution.$
$They are among the largest \CI  mosaic mappings available in nearby galaxies.$
$We combined the imaging of \Remark{CI10} and CO(2--1) in two nearby, more starbursty and AGN-hosting galaxies, i.e., NGC~1808 central \sim1~kpc, and NGC~7469 central \sim1.5~kpc at 140--160~pc resolutions.$
$Together, we studied the spatial distributions of \CI  and CO, and their line ratio \RCICO as functions of various galaxy resolved properties, including CO brightness (Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO}), ISRF \Umean (Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs ISRF}), and metallicity (Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs metallicity}).$
$In order to obtain the underlying intrinsic [\CI/CO] abundance ratio from the observed line ratio \RCICO, we assumed 7 representative ISM conditions and did both LTE and non-LTE calculations.$
$\vspace{1ex}$
$We summarize our findings as below:$
$\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0ex,topsep=1ex,leftmargin=4ex]$
$    \item The majority of the molecular gas in the SF disks of NGC~3627 and NGC~4321 has a uniform \Remark{RCI10CO21} = 0.10 \pm 0.05.$
$    \Remark{CI10} and \Remark{CO21} exhibit very similar spatial distributions at our 140--270~pc resolution.$
$    \item The majority of the molecular gas in the SB disk of NGC~1808 has \Remark{RCI10CO21} = 0.20 \pm 0.05.$
$    This elevated line ratio compared to the SF disk is likely caused by a \sim 3 \text{--} 5 \times increased [\CI/CO] abundance ratio, based on our LTE and non-LTE calculations and parameter assumptions (Figs.~\ref{fig: LTE RCICO} and \ref{fig: NonLTE RCICO}).$
$    \item The centres (r \lesssim 250~pc) of NGC~4321, NGC~3627, NGC~1808 and NGC~7469 show a strongly increasing trend in \Remark{RCI10CO21}, from 0.05 to 0.5, as a function of I_{\Remark{CO21}} --- i.e., \Remark{RCI10CO21} \approx 0.035   (I_{\Remark{CO21}}/[100\;\Kkms])^{0.8}.$
$    The inferred [\CI/CO] abundance ratio from our non-LTE calculation changes from \sim 0.2 to \sim 3, in line with the increasing X-ray luminosity of the centres/AGNs.$
$    \item The observed \RCICO versus ISRF trend is fairly flat, i.e., \RCICO  is insensitive to ISRF intensity changes, similar to the PDR model prediction calculated with PDRToolbox (although our resolution is much coarser than the physical scale of PDR models; Sect.~\ref{subsection: ISRF}).$
$    \item We find a \RCICO versus metallicity trend consistent with previous observations that covered lower-metallicity environments (\sim 0.2   \mathrm{Z_{\odot}}; \citealt{Bolatto2000b}), within the metallicity range (\sim 0.7 \text{--} 1   \mathrm{Z_{\odot}}) of our sample (Sect.~\ref{subsec: metallicity}).$
$    \item Our inferred [\CI/CO] abundance ratios agree well with the CRDR and XDR's theoretical studies.$
$    Given the drastically changed \RCICO , we propose that the \CI  to CO line ratio can be a promising indicator of CRDR (starbursting) and XDR (AGN). For instance, an observed line flux ratio of$
$    \Remark{RCI10CO21} \sim 0.2 \textnormal{--} 0.5 and \gtrsim 0.5 effectively indicates CRDR and XDR, respectively.$
$    \item We do not find ubiquitous "CO-dark", \CI -bright gas at the outer r\sim 1 \text{--} 3~kpc disks of NGC~3627 and NGC4321, nor systematic enhancement in \RCICO  at CO-faintest sightlines via stacking, mainly due to the incompleteness of our data.$
$    Nevertheless, a few sightlines, e.g., Region~22 in NGC~3627 show high \RCICO ~\sim 0.5 which do not fully comply with the noise behavior seen in our CASA simulations.$

$\section{Data reduction, imaging and moment map generation}$
$\label{appendix: data reduction}$
$After downloading the raw data, i.e., 12m+7m for \Remark{CO21} and 7m for \Remark{CI10}, respectively, we ran the observatory calibration pipeline ("scriptForPI") to reduce the data.$
$As shown in \citet{Leroy2021pipeline}, the observatory calibration produces well-calibrated visibility data without further manual flagging.$
$We then split out the visibility data and proceeded to the imaging step.$
$In order to match the spatial resolution of \Remark{CO21} and \Remark{CI10}, we carefully matched their uv ranges.$
$We flagged the \Remark{CO21} visibility data outside the uv range of 19--68~m (\sim15--52k\lambda) so as to match the uv range of the \Remark{CI10} data (minimum to 80\% percentile: 8.9--32~m, or \sim15--52k\lambda).$
$Given that the \Remark{CI10} uv plane distribution is elliptic, while the uv range selection in \incode{CASA} is circular, our chosen thresholds are adjusted to make the final \Remark{CO21} synthesized beam similar to that of \Remark{CI10}.$
$Note that in a later step we also convolved both image cubes to the exact same rounded beam (3.46") before generating the moment maps.$
$The \textit{PHANGS-ALMA imaging \& post-processing pipeline} \footnote{\url{https://github.com/akleroy/phangs_imaging_scripts}; version 2.0.} developed by \citet{Leroy2021pipeline} is used for creating line cubes and moment maps. The code is suitable for general nearby galaxy strong line mapping interferometric and total power mosaic data. In brief, the visibility data are carefully transformed into the user-given channel width and frequency range corresponding to the line plus line-free channels, then continuum is subtracted by fitting an order of zero polynomial. Then, two stages of imaging ("cleaning") are performed: first a multi-scale cleaning down to \sim4\sigma, then a single-scale cleaning down to \sim1\sigma. At each stage, \incode{CASA}'s \incode{tclean} task is iteratively called so as to force many major cycles, which has proven to improve the accuracy of the deconvolution. Before and during the second stage cleaning, a clean mask is computed at each iteration according to the outcome of previous iteration by finding all >2\sigma pixels associated with >4\sigma peaks in a watershed algorithm (\citealt{Rosolowsky2006,Rosolowsky2021}). In this way the cleaning can include as much signal as possible and ensure a signal-free residual.$
$Then the image cubes are corrected for the primary beam attenuation, converted to Kelvin units, and convolved to a common beam, which is the coarser beam of \Remark{CO21} and \Remark{CI10}. Because of our uv range flagging before imaging, the directly \incode{tclean}-imaged beam sizes are already close. This convolution further precisely matches \Remark{CO21} and \Remark{CI10} image cube beams.$
$Next, moment maps are generated with modules in the PHANGS-ALMA pipeline, consistently for CO and \CI . This process includes firstly constructing noise and mask cubes from the image cubes, then combining the masks (i.e., where science signal should present), then computing moment 0 -- line integrated intensity, moment 1 -- line peak velocity, and moment 2 -- line width. The mask cubes are the key in producing moment maps. Here two masks are built: a "broad mask" which contains as much plausible science signal as possible, and a "strict mask" which is optimized for high-confidence signal. The strict mask is made by finding peaks that have >4\sigma over two consecutive channels then expanding down to 2\sigma also with the watershed algorithm. Then the broad mask is obtained by aggregating strict masks made from image cubes convolved to coarser resolutions (\sim30" in this work as well as in \citealt{Leroy2021pipeline}).$
$To make consistent moment maps for CO and \CI , we aggregate their masks together as a joint mask, for broad and strict masks, respectively, then their final moment maps are computed within the joint mask.$
$The resulting \Remark{CO21} and \Remark{CI10} line intensity maps are then used for our next line ratio analysis. The line velocity and line width maps are not further analyzed, but are consistent with the products from the PHANGS-ALMA survey's data release as well as in \citet{Lang2020}. Given that the PHANGS-ALMA 12m+7m+tp \Remark{CO21} has the full spatial information and are deeper, their line velocity and line width maps are more useful for kinematic studies than ours produced from this work.$
$\section{Assessing the missing flux in the NGC~3627 \CI  data}$
$\label{appendix: missing flux}$
$We assess the level of missing flux in the NGC~3627 \CI  data in three ways:$
$(a) comparing with the \textit{Herschel} SPIRE FTS \Remark{CI10} observation in this galaxy,$
$(b) comparing the uv-trimmed CO(2-1) moment-0 map with the PHANGS-ALMA short-spacing corrected (12m+7m+tp) moment-0 map,$
$and (c) performing CASA simulation and comparing with the "true" moment-0 from the skymodel and the derived product from the simulated visibilities.$
$Method (a):$
$NGC~3627 has been observed with the \textit{Herschel} SPIRE (\citealt{Griffin2010}) Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS; \citealt{Naylor2010}) in mapping mode with nearly Nyquist sampling.$
$\cite{Liudz2015} reduced the archival data and extracted the line fluxes for each groups of pointings. \Remark{CI10} is detected with \SNR\sim4-5 at three sightlines from the galaxy centre to the southern bar end, with R.A. and Dec. coordinates (J2000) 170.061905, +12.991336, 170.066361 +12.987091, and 170.071243 +12.981615, respectively. The \Remark{CI10} luminosities are 1.44 \pm 0.31, 2.01 \pm 0.48, and 1.71 \pm 0.40 \times 10^{7} \; \mathrm{K km s^{-1} pc^{2}}, respectively, where the errors are purely from the RMS of line-free FTS spectra. By convolving our \Remark{CI10} line cube to the FTS beam of \sim39" then extracting the moment maps, we measure a \Remark{CI10} line luminosity of 0.52, 0.33 and 0.29 \times 10^{7} \; \mathrm{K km s^{-1} pc^{2}} at the above three positions, respectively, which means a missing flux of 36-75\% at the galaxy centre and 68-88\% at the southern bar end (at a 95\% confidence level).$
$Method (b):$
$We made ratio maps of our uv-trimmed CO(2-1) moment-0 map, and that of the original PHANGS-ALMA short-spacing-corrected (12m+7m+tp) CO(2-1) data but convolved to the corresponding resolution before making the moment maps. The ratio maps are made at two resolutions: the FTS 39" beam, and our working resolution of 3.46". The former leads to a missing flux of 26\%, 31\% and 36\% from the galaxy centre to the southern bar end. Note that the above \textit{Herschel} FTS analysis indicates in general a higher missing flux, but the FTS measurements are of low \SNR and errors purely from the RMS of the spectra can not fully account for other errors like pointing, spectral response, off-axis spaxel calibration, etc.$
$The latter ratio map shows that the missing flux at our working resolution and within the strict mask varies from \sim60\% to as low as 6\% at the brightest pixels. This is consistent with our next method based on simulation.$
$Method (c):$
$We performed detailed simulations of 7m-only \Remark{CI10} and 12m+7m \Remark{CO21} observations with the \incode{CASA} \incode{simobserve} task. We use the PHANGS-ALMA 12m+7m CO(2-1) clean model cube (one of the output products of \incode{CASA} \incode{tclean} runs) as the input \incode{skymodel} for \Remark{CO21}, and that scaled by a factor of 0.2 in Kelvin units for \Remark{CI10} (representing a constant \RCICO=0.2).$
$Note that we do not use the short-spacing-corrected PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) cube because it has a finite beam size of \sim1", and simulation based on that may result in more extended emissions. On the contrary, the clean model cube has an infinite resolution, and because both "multiscale" and "singlescale" cleaning are used in the PHANGS-ALMA imaging, the clean model contains point as well as extended sources.$
$We also set the actual observing dates and integration times as the real observations.$
$Then we run \incode{CASA} \incode{simobserve} to simulate the visibilities of each observing block, concatenate them together, and process them into image cubes and moment maps in the same way as described in Appendix~\ref{appendix: data reduction}. Meanwhile, by convolving the input \incode{skymodel} with a 2D Gaussian beam corresponding to our working resolution, and integrating over the spectral axis, we obtain a "true" \incode{skymodel} moment-0 map which can be directly compared to the imaged moment-0 maps from the simulation. Their ratio map shows a missing flux of \sim50\% to \sim7\% in the strict mask, and more specifically, 24\%, 58\%, 85\% and 96\% pixels selected in our method as for real data have a missing flux < 20\%, < 30\%, < 40\% and < 50\%, respectively.$
$Fig.~\ref{fig: missing flux} illustrates the results from methods (b) (upper panels) and (c) (lower panels). Left panels show the \Remark{CO21} moment-0 maps, analyzed at the same working resolution as our main analysis in Appendix~\ref{appendix: data reduction}. The simulated data show a fainter emission because we used the clean mode cube as the \incode{skymodel}, which was made by cleaning the PHANGS-ALMA 12m+7m data down to 1~\sigma within the clean mask voxels. This will indeed lose some fluxes. However, the right panels show that the two methods lead to consistent missing flux results.$
$Note that in the last panel of Fig.~\ref{fig: missing flux}, some regions appear black in the simulation-based analysis because we require line ratios to be analyzed in the strict mask, while these regions are not in it anymore. This is because the \incode{skymodel} loses some fluxes as mentioned above, thus the strict mask is smaller, and also because in the simulation we assumed a constant \RCICO which may lead to fainter \CI  than real data along faint sightlines, e.g., Region 22,  thus further shrinking the strict mask where both lines need to have sufficient \SNR.$
$Bearing these in mind, we conclude that methods (b) and (c) have consistent results on the missing flux, and method (a) is less accurate due to the unconsidered uncertainties.$
$These checks show that the overall missing flux in NGC~3627 is 31\% based on the full- and trimmed-uv \Remark{CO21} analysis, or \sim36-88\% based on the more-uncertain \textit{Herschel} data. At the pixel level, it varies from 7\% to \sim50\% from bright to faint sightlines at our working resolution of 3.46".$
$These values are as expected given our ACA-only observation setup.$
$We emphasize again that by applying the uv-matching in our data reduction, our \CI /\CO  line ratio study is not obviously affected by the missing flux issue, except perhaps in the faintest pixels or "cloud edges".$

$\section{Assessing noise-induced \CI  enhancement with simulation}$
$\label{appendix: simulation}$
$In Appendix~\ref{appendix: missing flux} we described our simulation. We also use it to assess how the noise can induce artificial [\CI/CO] line ratio variation.$
$In Fig.~\ref{fig: sim line ratio image} we show the line ratio map from the simulation with a constant \RCICO=0.2, and in Fig.~\ref{fig: sim line ratio scatter} we show the scatter plots with simulation results similar to Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO}. Interestingly, we see certain \CI/CO variations, especially \CI  "enhancement" at the edge of galaxy centre's gas clump (region~1), and the edge of the northern spiral arm (Region 14). Nevertheless, the trend is very different from the real data, i.e., Fig.~\ref{fig: line ratio vs CO}.$
$First, galaxy centre has a much weaker [\CI/CO] in the real data, whereas in the simulation it is inverted.$
$Second, the scatter is much larger in real data, with a tail of \CI  enhanced regions which is not seen in the simulation.$
$Third, from the bottom panels of Fig.~\ref{fig: sim line ratio scatter}, where \SNR is shown, we see that \RCICO is biased to be lower in low-\SNR situation. Thus the high \CI  in real data is unlikely to be a bias of low \SNR.$

$\section{Data reduction, imaging and moment map generation}$
$\label{appendix: data reduction}$
$After downloading the raw data, i.e., 12m+7m for \Remark{CO21} and 7m for \Remark{CI10}, respectively, we ran the observatory calibration pipeline ("scriptForPI") to reduce the data.$
$As shown in \citet{Leroy2021pipeline}, the observatory calibration produces well-calibrated visibility data without further manual flagging.$
$We then split out the visibility data and proceeded to the imaging step.$
$In order to match the spatial resolution of \Remark{CO21} and \Remark{CI10}, we carefully matched their uv ranges.$
$We flagged the \Remark{CO21} visibility data outside the uv range of 19--68~m (\sim15--52k\lambda) so as to match the uv range of the \Remark{CI10} data (minimum to 80\% percentile: 8.9--32~m, or \sim15--52k\lambda).$
$Given that the \Remark{CI10} uv plane distribution is elliptic, while the uv range selection in \incode{CASA} is circular, our chosen thresholds are adjusted to make the final \Remark{CO21} synthesized beam similar to that of \Remark{CI10}.$
$Note that in a later step we also convolved both image cubes to the exact same rounded beam (3.46") before generating the moment maps.$
$The \textit{PHANGS-ALMA imaging \& post-processing pipeline} \footnote{\url{https://github.com/akleroy/phangs_imaging_scripts}; version 2.0.} developed by \citet{Leroy2021pipeline} is used for creating line cubes and moment maps. The code is suitable for general nearby galaxy strong line mapping interferometric and total power mosaic data. In brief, the visibility data are carefully transformed into the user-given channel width and frequency range corresponding to the line plus line-free channels, then continuum is subtracted by fitting an order of zero polynomial. Then, two stages of imaging ("cleaning") are performed: first a multi-scale cleaning down to \sim4\sigma, then a single-scale cleaning down to \sim1\sigma. At each stage, \incode{CASA}'s \incode{tclean} task is iteratively called so as to force many major cycles, which has proven to improve the accuracy of the deconvolution. Before and during the second stage cleaning, a clean mask is computed at each iteration according to the outcome of previous iteration by finding all >2\sigma pixels associated with >4\sigma peaks in a watershed algorithm (\citealt{Rosolowsky2006,Rosolowsky2021}). In this way the cleaning can include as much signal as possible and ensure a signal-free residual.$
$Then the image cubes are corrected for the primary beam attenuation, converted to Kelvin units, and convolved to a common beam, which is the coarser beam of \Remark{CO21} and \Remark{CI10}. Because of our uv range flagging before imaging, the directly \incode{tclean}-imaged beam sizes are already close. This convolution further precisely matches \Remark{CO21} and \Remark{CI10} image cube beams.$
$Next, moment maps are generated with modules in the PHANGS-ALMA pipeline, consistently for CO and \CI . This process includes firstly constructing noise and mask cubes from the image cubes, then combining the masks (i.e., where science signal should present), then computing moment 0 -- line integrated intensity, moment 1 -- line peak velocity, and moment 2 -- line width. The mask cubes are the key in producing moment maps. Here two masks are built: a "broad mask" which contains as much plausible science signal as possible, and a "strict mask" which is optimized for high-confidence signal. The strict mask is made by finding peaks that have >4\sigma over two consecutive channels then expanding down to 2\sigma also with the watershed algorithm. Then the broad mask is obtained by aggregating strict masks made from image cubes convolved to coarser resolutions (\sim30" in this work as well as in \citealt{Leroy2021pipeline}).$
$To make consistent moment maps for CO and \CI , we aggregate their masks together as a joint mask, for broad and strict masks, respectively, then their final moment maps are computed within the joint mask.$
$The resulting \Remark{CO21} and \Remark{CI10} line intensity maps are then used for our next line ratio analysis. The line velocity and line width maps are not further analyzed, but are consistent with the products from the PHANGS-ALMA survey's data release as well as in \citet{Lang2020}. Given that the PHANGS-ALMA 12m+7m+tp \Remark{CO21} has the full spatial information and are deeper, their line velocity and line width maps are more useful for kinematic studies than ours produced from this work.$
$\section{Assessing the missing flux in the NGC~3627 \CI  data}$
$\label{appendix: missing flux}$
$We assess the level of missing flux in the NGC~3627 \CI  data in three ways:$
$(a) comparing with the \textit{Herschel} SPIRE FTS \Remark{CI10} observation in this galaxy,$
$(b) comparing the uv-trimmed CO(2-1) moment-0 map with the PHANGS-ALMA short-spacing corrected (12m+7m+tp) moment-0 map,$
$and (c) performing CASA simulation and comparing with the "true" moment-0 from the skymodel and the derived product from the simulated visibilities.$
$Method (a):$
$NGC~3627 has been observed with the \textit{Herschel} SPIRE (\citealt{Griffin2010}) Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS; \citealt{Naylor2010}) in mapping mode with nearly Nyquist sampling.$
$\cite{Liudz2015} reduced the archival data and extracted the line fluxes for each groups of pointings. \Remark{CI10} is detected with \SNR\sim4-5 at three sightlines from the galaxy centre to the southern bar end, with R.A. and Dec. coordinates (J2000) 170.061905, +12.991336, 170.066361 +12.987091, and 170.071243 +12.981615, respectively. The \Remark{CI10} luminosities are 1.44 \pm 0.31, 2.01 \pm 0.48, and 1.71 \pm 0.40 \times 10^{7} \; \mathrm{K km s^{-1} pc^{2}}, respectively, where the errors are purely from the RMS of line-free FTS spectra. By convolving our \Remark{CI10} line cube to the FTS beam of \sim39" then extracting the moment maps, we measure a \Remark{CI10} line luminosity of 0.52, 0.33 and 0.29 \times 10^{7} \; \mathrm{K km s^{-1} pc^{2}} at the above three positions, respectively, which means a missing flux of 36-75\% at the galaxy centre and 68-88\% at the southern bar end (at a 95\% confidence level).$
$Method (b):$
$We made ratio maps of our uv-trimmed CO(2-1) moment-0 map, and that of the original PHANGS-ALMA short-spacing-corrected (12m+7m+tp) CO(2-1) data but convolved to the corresponding resolution before making the moment maps. The ratio maps are made at two resolutions: the FTS 39" beam, and our working resolution of 3.46". The former leads to a missing flux of 26\%, 31\% and 36\% from the galaxy centre to the southern bar end. Note that the above \textit{Herschel} FTS analysis indicates in general a higher missing flux, but the FTS measurements are of low \SNR and errors purely from the RMS of the spectra can not fully account for other errors like pointing, spectral response, off-axis spaxel calibration, etc.$
$The latter ratio map shows that the missing flux at our working resolution and within the strict mask varies from \sim60\% to as low as 6\% at the brightest pixels. This is consistent with our next method based on simulation.$
$Method (c):$
$We performed detailed simulations of 7m-only \Remark{CI10} and 12m+7m \Remark{CO21} observations with the \incode{CASA} \incode{simobserve} task. We use the PHANGS-ALMA 12m+7m CO(2-1) clean model cube (one of the output products of \incode{CASA} \incode{tclean} runs) as the input \incode{skymodel} for \Remark{CO21}, and that scaled by a factor of 0.2 in Kelvin units for \Remark{CI10} (representing a constant \RCICO=0.2).$
$Note that we do not use the short-spacing-corrected PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) cube because it has a finite beam size of \sim1", and simulation based on that may result in more extended emissions. On the contrary, the clean model cube has an infinite resolution, and because both "multiscale" and "singlescale" cleaning are used in the PHANGS-ALMA imaging, the clean model contains point as well as extended sources.$
$We also set the actual observing dates and integration times as the real observations.$
$Then we run \incode{CASA} \incode{simobserve} to simulate the visibilities of each observing block, concatenate them together, and process them into image cubes and moment maps in the same way as described in Appendix~\ref{appendix: data reduction}. Meanwhile, by convolving the input \incode{skymodel} with a 2D Gaussian beam corresponding to our working resolution, and integrating over the spectral axis, we obtain a "true" \incode{skymodel} moment-0 map which can be directly compared to the imaged moment-0 maps from the simulation. Their ratio map shows a missing flux of \sim50\% to \sim7\% in the strict mask, and more specifically, 24\%, 58\%, 85\% and 96\% pixels selected in our method as for real data have a missing flux < 20\%, < 30\%, < 40\% and < 50\%, respectively.$
$Fig.~\ref{fig: missing flux} illustrates the results from methods (b) (upper panels) and (c) (lower panels). Left panels show the \Remark{CO21} moment-0 maps, analyzed at the same working resolution as our main analysis in Appendix~\ref{appendix: data reduction}. The simulated data show a fainter emission because we used the clean mode cube as the \incode{skymodel}, which was made by cleaning the PHANGS-ALMA 12m+7m data down to 1~\sigma within the clean mask voxels. This will indeed lose some fluxes. However, the right panels show that the two methods lead to consistent missing flux results.$

$Bearing these in mind, we conclude that methods (b) and (c) have consistent results on the missing flux, and method (a) is less accurate due to the unconsidered uncertainties.$
$These checks show that the overall missing flux in NGC~3627 is 31\% based on the full- and trimmed-uv \Remark{CO21} analysis, or \sim36-88\% based on the more-uncertain \textit{Herschel} data. At the pixel level, it varies from 7\% to \sim50\% from bright to faint sightlines at our working resolution of 3.46".$
$These values are as expected given our ACA-only observation setup.$
$We emphasize again that by applying the uv-matching in our data reduction, our \CI /\CO  line ratio study is not obviously affected by the missing flux issue, except perhaps in the faintest pixels or "cloud edges".$

**Abstract:** We present new neutral atomic carbon [ C $i$ ] ( $ ^3P_1 \to  ^3P_0$ ) mapping observations within the inner $\sim 7$ kpc and $\sim 4$ kpc of the disks of NGC 3627 and NGC 4321 at a spatial resolution of 190 pc and 270 pc, respectively, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) Atacama Compact Array (ACA).We combine these with the CO(2--1) data from PHANGS-ALMA, and literature [ C $i$ ] and CO data for two other starburst and/or active galactic nucleus (AGN) galaxies (NGC 1808, NGC 7469), to study: $_a)_$ the spatial distributions of C $i$ and CO emission; $_b)_$ the observed line ratio $\RCICO = I_{\mathrm{[C{\normalfonti}]}(1\textnormal{--}0)} / I_{\mathrm{CO}(2\textnormal{--}1)}$ as a function of various galactic properties; and $_c)_$ the abundance ratio of [ C $i$ /CO ] .We find excellent spatial correspondence between C $i$ and CO emission and nearly uniform $\RCICO \sim 0.1$ across the majority of the star-forming disks of NGC 3627 and NGC 4321.However, $\RCICO$ strongly varies from $\sim 0.05$ at the centre of NGC 4321 to $> 0.2 \text{--} 0.5$ in NGC 1808's starbursting centre and NGC 7469's centre with an X-ray-luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN).Meanwhile, $\RCICO $ does not obviously vary with $\Umean$ , similar to the prediction of photodissociation dominated region (PDR) models.We also find a mildly decreasing $\RCICO $ with an increasing metallicity over $0.7\text{--}0.85 \mathrm{Z_{\odot}}$ , consistent with the literature.Assuming various typical ISM conditions representing giant molecular clouds, active star-forming regions and strong starbursting environments, we calculate the local-thermodynamic-equilibrium radiative transfer and estimate the [ C $i$ /CO ] abundance ratio to be $\sim 0.1$ across the disks of NGC 3627 and NGC 4321, similar to previous large-scale findings in Galactic studies.However, this abundance ratio likely has a substantial increase to $\sim 1$ and $\gtrsim 1$ --5 in NGC 1808's starburst and NGC 7469's strong AGN environments, respectively, in line with the expectations for cosmic-ray dominated region (CRDR) and X-ray dominated region (XDR) chemistry.Finally, we do not find a robust evidence for a generally CO-dark, C $i$ -bright gas in the disk areas we probed.

Typical line widths of 10 km s$^{-1}$(NGC 3627 and NGC 4321) and 30 km s$^{-1}$(NGC 1808 and NGC 7469) in sigma are used to calculate the thresholds together with the channel rms in Table \ref{table: targets}.
        For NGC 3627 and NGC 4321, their ($uv$-matched) CO(2--1) $5 \sigma$ thresholds are out of the plotting range.

        The red line with a slope of 0.8 in logarithm ($0.035   (I_{$\Remark${CO21}}/[100 $\Kkms$])^{0.8}$) visually guides the trend of increasing $\RCICO$ in the central regions of these galaxies (see boxes in Figs. \ref{fig: NGC3627 line ratio map} to \ref{fig: other line ratio maps}, sizes $\sim 300$--500 pc).

**Figure 13. -** _Left_: $\Remark{ICI10}$ versus $\Remark{ICO21}$ in the four galaxies we studied: NGC 3627, NGC 4321, NGC 1808 and NGC 7469. $\Remark{ICI10}$ and $\Remark{ICO21}$ integrated fluxes are moment-0 intensities extracted from their beam and pixel size matched data cubes. Only data points with propagated moment-0 $\SNR \ge 5$ are shown.
        The blue (with crossed hatch), green (with horizontal line hatch), gray (with dotted hatch) and light gray shadings indicate the $5 \sigma$ thresholds for the four galaxies, respectively. Typical line widths of 10 km s$^{-1}$(NGC 3627 and NGC 4321) and 30 km s$^{-1}$(NGC 1808 and NGC 7469) in sigma are used to calculate the thresholds together with the channel rms in Table \ref{table: targets}.
        For NGC 3627 and NGC 4321, their ($uv$-matched) CO(2--1) $5 \sigma$ thresholds are out of the plotting range.
        Top axis shows the simply-converted H$_2$ surface density using a constant $\alphaCO = 4.3$ and CO excitation (i.e., CO(2--1) to CO(1--0) line ratio) $R_{21} = 0.65$.

**Figure 8. -** 
        Observed/calculated $\RCICO$ as a function of CO column density $\CO$columndensity  and [$\CI$/CO] abundance (column density) ratio $\RNCINCO$ for 7 representative ISM conditions, based on LTE calculations.
        _Upper panels_: Curved lines are $\RCICO$ versus $\RNCINCO$ for different $\CO$columndensity  as indicated by the color. Dashed means CO(2--1) optically thick and $\Remark{CI10}$ optically thin, dotted means both are both optically thin, and solid line means both optically thick.
        Horizontal thick line is the observed $\RCICO$ value.
        _Lower panels_: Black contours are $\RCICO = 0.05,   0.10,   0.20$ and $0.50$ in the CO column density versus $\CI$/CO abundance ratio plane.
        Vertical color shading indicates the final $\RNCINCO$ that can match both the observed $\RCICO $ and the assumed $\Sigmol$ value noted at the top of each panel.
