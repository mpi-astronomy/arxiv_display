**Abstract:** New extragalactic measurements of the cloud population-averaged star formation efficiency per free-fall time $\rm \epsilon_{\rm ff}$ from PHANGS show little sign of a theoretically predicted dependence on the gas virial level and weak variation with cloud-scale gas velocity dispersion.We explore ways to bring theory into consistency with the observations, in particular highlighting systematic variations in internal density structure that must happen together with an increase in virial parameter typical towards denser galaxy centers.To introduce these variations into conventional turbulence-regulated star formation models, we adopt three adjustments, together motivated by the expectation that the background host galaxy has an influence on the cloud-scale: we incorporate self-gravity and an internal density distribution that contains a broad power-law (PL) component and resembles the structure observed in local resolved clouds, we allow that the internal gas kinematics include motion in the background potential and let this regulate the onset of self-gravitation, and we assume that the distribution of gas densities is in a steady-state for only a fraction of a cloud free-fall time.  In practice, these changes significantly reduce the efficiencies predicted in multi-free-fall (MFF) scenarios compared to purely lognormal (LN) probability density functions (PDFs) and ties efficiency variations to variations in the slope of the PL $\alpha$ .We fit the model to PHANGS measurements of $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ to identify the PL slopes that yield an optimal match.  These slopes vary systematically with galactic environment in the sense that gas that sits furthest from virial balance contains fractionally more gas at high density.  We relate this to the equilibrium response of gas in the presence of the galactic gravitational potential, which forces more gas to high density than characteristic of fully self-gravitating clouds.Viewing the efficiency variations as originating with time evolution in the power-law slope, our findings would alternatively imply coordination of the cloud evolutionary stage within environment.With this `galaxy regulation' behavior included, our preferred `self-gravitating' sgMFF models function similarly to the original, roughly `virialized cloud' single-free-fall models.  However, outside the environment of disks with their characteristic regulation, the flexible MFF models may be better suited.

**Figure 7. -** Diagnostics of the hybrid LN+PL density PDFs that match different MFF (and SFF) SF models to the $\rm \epsilon_{\rm ff}$ values measured in PHANGS, from left to right: the slope of the PL component of the PDF $\alpha$, the dense gas fraction $f_{\rm d}$ measured above a fixed density threshold (see text) and the self-gravitating fraction $f_{\rm sg}$ measured above the critical density $s_{\rm crit}$. The top row shows results for PDFs in the fiducial broad PL, shortened duration model given in Eq. (\ref{eq:finaleff}), adopting a MFF scenario. The second row shows results for PDFs in the broad PL, full duration model with $t_{\rm obs}=t_{\rm stop}$ in Eq. (\ref{eq:finaleff}) also in the MFF scenario.  The bottom two rows show MFF (third row) or SFF (fourth row) predictions adopting hybrid smooth-PDFs in the Burkhart formulation, with $s_{\rm t}=s_{\rm crit}$ advocated by \cite{burkmocz}.  All SF models shown here have assumed $\epsilon_{\rm core}=0.5$, $\phi_t=1$, $b=0.87$ and $c_s=0.3$ km s$^{-1}$ and the critical density given in Eq. (\ref{eq:scritKM05}).
As indicated by the color bar in the top right panel, points are color-coded by galactocentric radius (increasing outward, from red to purple). Symbol style denotes relative gas surface density; in all radial bins, regions sitting below the 30$^{th}$ percentile are marked with diamonds, regions between the 30$^{th}$ and 70$^{th}$ are marked with a circle, and regions above the 70$^{th}$ percentile are marked with a cross.  The gray points in the bottom row repeat the measurements from the top row.  The horizontal gray line (band) in the top left panel shows the mean (full spread) of the PL slopes $\alpha$ observed in local clouds \citep{Kainulainen14}.  The gray band in the middle panels illustrates the relation between dense gas fraction and gas surface density fitted by \cite{neumann23}. The width of the band represents the full spread in the fitted data (roughly 3 times the scatter about the fit line).

**Figure 4. -** The time-average $\rm \epsilon_{\rm ff}$ measured in 1.5-kpc wide hexagonal apertures sampling throughout 67 nearby galaxies targeted by PHANGS, as measured by \cite{leroy24}.  Measurements are plotted against the average cloud-scale velocity dispersion $\langle\sigma_{\rm mol}^{\rm cloud}\rangle$ in each aperture (\citealt{leroy24}; see \citealt{sun22,sun23} for details). Representative values for the $z\sim1$ clumps examined by \cite{dz23} are indicated by the thick gray point and bar, which depict the mean and rms of clump velocity dispersions, respectively, at the 11\% efficiency estimated for these clumps \citep{dz23}.
Colored lines illustrate basic predictions from turbulence-regulated SF models in single-free-fall (SFF) and multi-free-fall  (MFF) scenarios: \cite{KM05}(KM05, SFF; blue), \cite{PN11}(PN11, SFF; purple, scaled down by a factor of 10) and \cite{FK12}(FK12, MFF; red, scaled down by a factor of 100).  Each model is shown at three values of the virial parameter $\alpha_{\rm vir}=2.9$, $\alpha_{\rm vir}=5.3$ and $\alpha_{\rm vir}=9.7$, the 16$^{\rm th}$, 50$^{\rm th}$ and 84$^{\rm th}$ percentiles of the plotted regions, respectively.  The linewidth of the trends increases with increasing virial parameter.
All models adopt $\epsilon_{\rm core} =0.5$, $b=0.87$, $\phi_t=1.9$ and gas sound speed $c_s = 0.3   {\rm km   s^{-1}}$(see main text for definitions of these quantities) and, for comparison purposes, the same definition for the critical density, given by Eq. (\ref{eq:scritKM05}), estimated using the appropriate virial parameter for each line.

**Figure 3. -** 
 Variation in the PL slope $\alpha$ calculated with the shortened duration model given in Eq. (\ref{eq:finaleff}) as a function of the cloud-scale virial parameter $\alpha_{\rm vir}$.  Symbol shapes and colors are as in Figure \ref{fig:results1}.
 The horizontal gray line (band) shows the mean (full spread) of the PL slopes $\alpha$ observed in local clouds \citep{Kainulainen14}. The reference line given by Eq. (\ref{eq:approximatealpha}) with $\mathcal{R}_\alpha=0.23\pm0.06$ is shown in black. Combining the systematic variation of dense gas fraction with virial state implied here together with variations in the critical density (depending on $\alpha_{\rm vir}$) produces star formation efficiencies that match the PHANGS observations in Fig. \ref{fig:PHANGSsfe}(see also Fig. \ref{fig:PHANGSsfeMODEL} and the discussion in $\S$\ref{sec:discussionMFFvKM05}).
