**Abstract:** The tomographic approach to analyse the 3 $\times$ 2pt signal involves dividing the observed galaxy sample into a configuration of redshift bins. We present a simulation-based method to explore the optimum tomographic binning strategy for _Euclid_ , focusing on the expected configuration of its first major data release (DR1). To do this, we 1) simulate a _Euclid_ -like observation and generate mock shear catalogues from multiple realisations of the 3 $\times$ 2pt fields on the sky, and 2) measure the 3 $\times$ 2pt Pseudo- $C_{\ell}$ power spectra for a given tomographic configuration and derive the constraints that they place on the standard dark energy equation of state parameters $(w_{0},w_{a})$ . For a simulation including Gaussian-distributed photometric redshift uncertainty and shape noise under a $\Lambda$ CDM cosmology, we find that bins equipopulated with galaxies yield the best constraints on $(w_{0},w_{a})$ for an analysis of the full 3 $\times$ 2pt signal, or the angular clustering component only. For the cosmic shear component, the optimum $(w_{0},w_{a})$ constraints are achieved by bins equally spaced in fiducial comoving distance. However, the advantage with respect to alternative binning choices is only a few percent in the size of the $1 \sigma (w_{0},w_{a})$ contour, and we conclude that the cosmic shear is relatively insensitive to the binning methodology. We find that the information gain extracted on $(w_{0},w_{a})$ for any 3 $\times$ 2pt component starts to saturate at $\gtrsim$ 7--8 bins. Any marginal gains resulting from a greater number of bins is likely to be limited by additional uncertainties present in a real measurement, and the increasing demand for accuracy of the covariance matrix. Finally, we consider a $5\%$ contamination from catastrophic photometric redshift outliers and find that, if these errors are not mitigated in the analysis, the bias induced in the 3 $\times$ 2pt signal for 10 equipopulated bins results in dark energy constraints that are inconsistent with the fiducial $\Lambda$ CDM cosmology at $>5 \sigma$ .

**Figure 3. -** The areas enclosed by the $1 \sigma$(Blue) and $2 \sigma$ contours in the $(w_{0}, w_{a})$ plane, for different numbers of redshift bins used in a tomographic analysis of the cosmic shear signal measured from 400 realisations of our simulation. We show in circular markers joined with solid lines the areas measured for the equipopulated binning choice; in square markers joined with dashed lines the equal comoving distance bins; and in triangular markers joined with dotted lines the equal redshift width binning choice. Since the cosmic shear component alone is relatively weakly constraining, the 1 bin measurement does not yield a closed contour in $(w_{0}, w_{a})$ within the ranges of the parameter grid. Hence, the data point for this case represents a lower bound of the true value, which we represent by using a vertical arrow. (*fig:w0wa_NONOISE_1x2ptE*)

We vary the number of redshift bins used for each of the equipopulated, equally spaced in fiducial comoving distance, and equal redshift width binning strategies. (*fig:w0wa_NOISE_3x2pt*)

**Figure 2. -** Illustration of the method used to simulate a mock weak lensing survey. 2D maps of the correlated 3$\times$2pt fields are generated at finely-sampled points in redshift. These 2D maps are used to approximate the full 3D cosmological information of the 3$\times$2pt signal. From the overdensity fields, we Poisson sample a galaxy population that traces the underlying $n(z)$ distribution. We then assign the correlated weak lensing observables to each galaxy from the shear field values at the galaxy's angular position on the sky at a given redshift. We show an early approximation of the _Euclid_ DR1 footprint at the bottom of the figure which we have used to create our _Euclid_-like simulations. The `observed' region is shown in yellow. (The actual _Euclid_ DR1 footprint will be significantly different to that shown here.) (*fig:nz_diagram*)
