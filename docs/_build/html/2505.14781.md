**Abstract:** Galaxy evolution is driven by spatially distributed processes with varying timescales.Integral field spectroscopy provides spatially-resolved information about these processes.Nevertheless, disentangling these processes, which are related to both the underlying stellar populations and the interstellar medium can be challenging.We present a case study on NGC 613, observed with MUSE (Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) for the TIMER (Time Inference with MUSE in Extragalactic Rings) project, a local barred galaxy, which shows several gas ionisation mechanisms and is rich in both large and inner-scale stellar structures.We develop a set of steps to overcome fundamental problems in the modelling of emission lines with multiple components, together with the characterisation of the stellar populations.That results in the disentanglement of the gas ionisation mechanisms and kinematics, along with an optimal parametrisation for star formation history recovery.Our analysis reveals evidence of gas inflows, which are associated with the bar dust lanes traced with _Hubble_ Space Telescope (HST).In addition, we show the gas kinematics in a central biconical outflow, which is aligned with a radio jet observed with Very Large Array (VLA).The emission line provides estimates of electron density, gas-phase metallicity, and the mass outflow rate, allowing us to distinguish intertwined ionisation mechanisms and to identify a part of the multiphase gas cycle in NGC 613.It traces the gas kinematics from the bar lanes to inner scale gas reservoirs, where it can eventually trigger star formation or AGN activity, as observed in the outflow.

**Figure 5. -** Ionisation mechanism classification with emission line ratios.
We present spatially resolved [$\ion${N}{II}]/H$\alpha$ and [$\ion${O}{III}]/H$\beta$ ratios, as a proxy for the ionisation sequence (top left and top right, respectively). In the bottom row, the BPT diagrams are shown, both colour-coded according to the top left panel scale.
In the BPT diagrams, the dashed line corresponds to the \citet{kauffmann2003} demarcation, the continuous to \citet{kewley2001}, the dotted line to the results from \citet{kevinschawinski2007}, and dash-dotted from \citet{kewley2006}.
The nuclear disc dimension is marked by the central ellipse into the top panels. (*fig:bpt*)

**Figure 7. -** Setting the regularisation parameter and the impact of the observation normalisation in the parametrisation. The regularisation is parametrised with regul=1/$\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the regularisation parameter. The maps are colour coded according to the ratio between the $\chi_{{\rm reg}}$ of the fit and the maximum degraded $\chi_{{\rm unr}} + \Delta\chi$ of a regularised solution, regarding the criterion outlined in \citet{press2007}. Top row: observations normalised by a scalar factor, for $\Delta$ between 0.4 and 0.05. Bottom row: normalisation with scalar field (a scalar factor for each spectrum), with $\Delta$ varying from 0.05 to 0.01. (*fig:regul*)
