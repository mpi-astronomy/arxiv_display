**Abstract:** BE Lyncis (BE Lyn) is a well-studied high-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti variable star (HADS). Recently, \citet{be_lyn_2026} analyzed a 39-year baseline of times of maximum light of BE Lyn, reporting that it is the most eccentric binary known ( $e \approx 0.9989$ ) and hosts the nearest black hole (BH) known to date. We analyze _Hipparcos_ and _Gaia_ astrometry of BE Lyn, predicting what the observed proper motion anomaly (PMA) over the 25 year baseline between the two missions would be were the companion really a $\gtrsim 17.5 M_{\odot}$ BH. We find that the predicted PMA is at least an order of magnitude larger than the observed value of $\approx 1.7 \pm 0.8$ mas yr $^{-1}$ , regardless of the assumed orientation of the orbit. We  predict the expected _Gaia_ DR3 \texttt{RUWE} for different orientations of the putative BH binary, finding that it ranges from $\approx 2.5$ -- $4.0$ , much larger than the reported value of 1.073. The observed value is instead consistent with a low-mass secondary or a single star. We find that BE Lyncis would have received a 7-parameter acceleration solution if it were a BH binary, in contradiction with its absence from the _Gaia_ DR3 non-single star catalogs. Finally, we show that the reported orbit is impossible because the luminous star would overflow its Roche lobe at periastron, irrespective of inclination. We recommend caution in interpreting light-travel time effect (LTTE) models that require very high eccentricities, face-on inclinations, or large companion masses. The observed pulsation timing variations are most likely simply a result of red noise or pulsation phase evolution.

**Figure 1. -** Predicted instantaneous proper motions for BE Lyn, assuming the best-fit orbital parameters reported by \citet{be_lyn_2026}. We adopt $\Omega = 60^{\circ}$. We show the predicted _Hipparcos_, _Gaia_ DR2, and _Gaia_ DR3 proper motions as well, with the predicted individual epoch measurements plotted with lower opacity. We zoom in on these astrometric measurements in the lower panels. In these panels, we denote the measured _Hipparcos_ proper motions with dashed lines; the shaded regions represent the corresponding uncertainties. Clearly, the observed and predicted _Hipparcos_ proper motions are quite different. We predict that we would observe a proper motion anomaly of $\Delta \mu_{\alpha*} \approx 31$ mas yr$^{-1}$ and  $\Delta \mu_{\delta} \approx 15$ mas yr$^{-1}$ over a 25-year baseline, far greater than the $1$--$2$ mas yr$^{-1}$ differences that are actually observed.
