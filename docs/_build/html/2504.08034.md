**Abstract:** A subset of galaxies have dense nuclei, and when these galaxies are accreted and tidally stripped, the nuclei can masquerade as globular clusters in the halos of large galaxies. If these nuclei contain massive central black holes, some may accrete gas and become observable as active galactic nuclei. Previous studies have found that candidate stripped nuclei rarely host luminous X-ray sources, but these studies were typically restricted to both the most massive candidate nuclei and the most luminous X-ray sources. Here we use new and archival Chandra and XMM-Newton data to search for X-ray emission in a near-complete sample of massive globular clusters and candidate stripped nuclei in the nearest accessible elliptical galaxy, NGC 5128. This sample has the unique advantage that the candidate stripped nuclei are identified dynamically via elevated mass-to-light ratios. Our central result is that 5/22 ( $23^{+11}_{-6}$ \% ) of the candidate stripped nuclei have X-ray sources down to a typical limit of $L_X \sim 5 \times 10^{36}$ erg s $^{-1}$ , a fraction lower than or comparable to that among massive clusters with normal mass-to-light ratios (16/41; $39^{+8}_{-7}$ \% ). Hence we confirm and extend the result that nearly all X-ray sources in stripped nuclei are likely to be X-ray binaries rather than active galactic nuclei. If the candidate stripped nuclei have black holes of typical masses $\sim 2 \times 10^{5} M_{\odot}$ needed to explain their elevated mass-to-light ratios, then they have typical Eddington ratios of $\lesssim 2 \times 10^{-6}$ . This suggests that it will be challenging to conduct an accretion census of wandering black holes around even nearby galaxies.

**Figure 2. -** 1--10 keV X-ray luminosity vs. $M/L_V$ for all sources, with detections shown as filled circled and non-detections (upper limits) shown as unfilled downward triangles. The similarity of the X-ray properties of the low and high-$M/L_V$ objects is evident. There are three sources with $M/L_V$ much larger than the other clusters, which have especially strong dynamical cases for being stripped nuclei. (*fig:ml_plot*)

**Figure 3. -** The 63 clusters in our sample plotted on a Digitized Sky Survey image of Cen A, with north up and east to the left. While many clusters are projected within the central 10s of kpc of the galaxy, some are in the distant outer halo, with the southernmost object at 116 kpc projected. The 30 kpc scale bar corresponds to $0.45^{\circ}$. (*fig:spat*)
