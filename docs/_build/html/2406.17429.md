**Abstract:** The blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxy I Zw 18 is one of the most metal-poor ( $Z \sim 3\%   Z_{\sun}$ ) star-forming galaxies known in the local Universe. Since its discovery, the evolutionary status of this system has been at the center of numerous debates within the astronomical community. We aim to probe and resolve the stellar populations of I Zw 18 in the near-IR using JWST/NIRCam's unprecedented imaging spatial resolution and sensitivity. Additionally, our goal is to derive the spatially resolved star formation history (SFH) of the galaxy within the last $1$ Gyr, and to provide constraints for older epochs. We used the point spread function fitting photometry package \texttt{DOLPHOT} to measure positions and fluxes of point sources in the $F115W$ and $F200W$ filters' images of I Zw 18, acquired as part of the JWST GTO ID 1233 (PI: Meixner). Furthermore, to derive I Zw 18's SFH, we applied a state-of-the-art color-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting technique ( \texttt{SFERA} 2.0), using two independent sets of stellar models: PARSEC-COLIBRI and MIST. Our analysis of I Zw 18's CMD reveal three main stellar populations: one younger than $\sim30$ Myr, mainly associated with the northwest star-forming (SF) region; an intermediate-age population ( $\sim 100 - 800$ Myr), associated with the southeast SF region; and a red and faint population, linked to the underlying halo of the galaxy, older than $1$ Gyr and possibly as old as $13.8$ Gyr. The main body of the galaxy shows a very low star formation rate (SFR) of $\sim 10^{-4} \; M_{\odot} \; {yr}^{-1}$ between $1$ and $13.8$ Gyr ago. In the last billion years, I Zw 18 shows an increasing trend, culminating in two strong bursts of SF around $\sim 10$ and $\sim100$ Myr ago. Notably, I Zw 18 Component C mimics the evolution of the main body, but with lower SFRs on average. Our results confirm that I Zw 18 is populated by stars of all ages, without any major gaps. Thus, I Zw 18 is not a truly young galaxy, but rather a system characterized by an old underlying stellar halo, in agreement with what has been found in other BCDs by similar studies. The low SF activity exhibited at epochs older than $1$ Gyr is in agreement with the "slow cooking’’ dwarf scenario proposed in the literature, and could have contributed to its low metal content. The galaxy is now experiencing its strongest episode of star formation ( $\sim 0.6   M_{\sun}   yr^{-1}$ ) mainly located in the northwest region. A recent gravitational interaction between the main body and Component C is the most likely explanation for this starburst.

**Figure 1. -** $F200W$$(\sim K)$ JWST/NIRCam image cutout displaying I Zw 18's main body (southeast) and Component C (northwest). We divided the main body of the galaxy in four different regions, going from the two inner star-forming regions (labeled R1 and R2, respectively), a middle section (R3), and the outermost region (R4). The Component C is also labeled in the image. In the bottom-left corner is shown a physical scale corresponding to $\sim 5.7$\arcsec$$($\sim 500$ pc). (*F200W_cutout*)

A population of upper MS stars younger than $30$ Myr (blue circles, left panel), AGB stars of intermediate ages between $0.1$ and $1$ Gyr (green circles, middle panel), and a population of RGB and low-mass AGB stars older than $1$ Gyr (red circles, right panel). The insert panels on the bottom-left show the respected position in the CMD of the selected bona fide stellar populations. (*fig:spatial distribution*)

**Figure 7. -** \texttt{SFERA} 2.0 results for region 1. Panels (a)-(b): recovered SFH and mass using PARSEC-COLIBRI (orange line) and MIST (blue line) isochrones. The shaded areas mark the 16-84 percentiles. Panels (c)-(d): Data (black points) vs. model CMD luminosity functions for different luminosity intervals (indicated on the upper-right). Again, the PARSEC-COLIBRI solution is in orange, while the MIST in blue. Panels (e)-(g): Observational CMD, \texttt{SFERA} 2.0 best fit model CMD and normalized residuals for each CMD cell ($data - model/\sqrt{model}$). The diagrams are color-coded according to the number of stars in each cell (see color-bar in the upper-right corner). The dark-shade masks the region of the CMD that is below our fiducial $50\%$ completeness limit. This region is excluded from the fitting procedure. (*fig:region1_results*)
