**Abstract:** Aiming to detect planetary companions to young stars with debris disks viathe radial velocity method, we observed HD114082 during April 2018 - August2022 as one of the targets of our RVSPY program (Radial Velocity Survey forPlanets around Young stars). We used the FEROS spectrograph, mounted to theMPG/ESO 2.2 m telescope in Chile, to obtain high signal-to-noise spectra andtime series of precise radial velocities (RVs). Additionally, we analyzedarchival HARPS spectra and TESS photometric data. We used the CERES, CERES++and SERVAL pipelines to derive RVs and activity indicators and ExoStriker forthe independent and combined analysis of the RVs and TESS photometry. We reportthe discovery of a warm super-Jovian companion around HD114082 based on a109.8$\pm$0.4 day signal in the combined RV data from FEROS and HARPS, and onone transit event in the TESS photometry. The best-fit model indicates a8.0$\pm$1.0 Mjup companion with a radius of 1.00$\pm$0.03 Rjup in an orbit witha semi-major axis of 0.51$\pm$0.01 au and an eccentricity of 0.4$\pm$0.04. Thecompanions orbit is in agreement with the known near edge-on debris disklocated at about 28 au. HD114082b is possibly the youngest (15$\pm$6 Myr), andone of only three younger than 100 Myr giant planetary companions for whichboth their mass and radius have been determined observationally. It is probablythe first properly model-constraining giant planet that allows distinguishingbetween hot and cold-start models. It is significantly more compatible with thecold-start model.

**Figure 7. -** 
RV time series data for HD 114082. FEROS data from RVSPY are shown as black circles. The RVs computed from the publicly available HARPS spectra are shown as gray circles. Error bars account for the suspected activity jitter (see text for details). The solid gray line shows the best-fit model (see parameters in Table \ref{tab:plan_pars}), and the vertical blue line indicates the time of the observed transit. The lower panel shows the residuals of the fit.

**Figure 8. -** 
Time series and GLS of the RVs and activity indicators derived from the FEROS spectra (left and middle panels, respectively). The right panels show the correlation with respect to the FEROS RVs for the derived key activity indicators. The type of activity indicator is given in each of the panels of the middle column. The vertical red line shows the suspected planetary period ($P$ = 109.8 d), from the model with linear trend of the combined RVs (FEROS+HARPS) and photometric (TESS) data.
