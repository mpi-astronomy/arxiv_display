**Abstract:** We present the UV-to-NIR size evolution of a sample of 161 quiescent galaxies with $M_* > 10^{10}M_\sun$ over $0.5<z<5$ . With deep multi-band NIRCam images in GOODS-South from JADES, we measure the effective radii ( $R_e$ ) of the galaxies at rest-frame 0.3, 0.5 and 1 $\micron$ . On average, we find that quiescent galaxies are 45 \% (15 \% ) more compact at rest-frame 1 $\micron$ than they are at 0.3 $\micron$ (0.5 $\micron$ ). Regardless of wavelengths, the $R_e$ of quiescent galaxies strongly evolves with redshift, and this evolution depends on stellar mass.  For lower-mass quiescent galaxies with $M_* = 10^{10}-10^{10.6}M_\sun$ , the evolution follows $R_e\propto(1+z)^{-1.1}$ , whereas it becomes steeper, following $R_e\propto(1+z)^{-1.7}$ , for higher-mass quiescent galaxies with $M_* > 10^{10.6}M_\sun$ . To constrain the physical mechanisms driving the apparent size evolution, we study the relationship between $R_e$ and the formation redshift ( $z_{\rm{form}}$ ) of quiescent galaxies. For lower-mass quiescent galaxies, this relationship is broadly consistent with $R_e\propto(1+z_{\rm{form}})^{-1}$ , in line with the expectation of the progenitor effect. For higher-mass quiescent galaxies, the relationship between $R_e$ and $z_{\rm{form}}$ depends on stellar age. Older quiescent galaxies have a steeper relationship between $R_e$ and $z_{\rm{form}}$ than that expected from the progenitor effect alone, suggesting that mergers and/or post-quenching continuous gas accretion drive additional size growth in very massive systems. We find that the $z>3$ quiescent galaxies in our sample are very compact, with mass surface densities $\Sigma_e \gtrsim 10^{10} M_\sun/\rm{kpc}^2$ , and their $R_e$ are possibly even smaller than anticipated from the size evolution measured for lower-redshift quiescent galaxies. Finally, we take a close look at the structure of GS-9209, one of the earliest confirmed massive quiescent galaxies at $z_{\rm{spec}} \sim 4.7$ . From UV to NIR, GS-9209 becomes increasingly compact, and its light profile becomes more spheroidal, showing that the color gradient is already present in this earliest massive quiescent galaxy.

**Figure 12. -** Rest-frame size evolution of massive quiescent galaxies. The corresponding best-fit parameters can be found in Table \ref{tab:size_evo}. ** Top:** The left panel shows the best-fit size evolution at rest-frame 0.3$\micron$(blue), 0.5$\micron$(green) and 1$\micron$(red), respectively. The shaded regions mark the $1\sigma$ uncertainties of the best-fit relations. The filled squares with error bars are median $R_e$ and their uncertainties in individual redshift bins (Section \ref{sec:size_evo}). The right panel shows the 1-, 2- and 3-$\sigma$ contours of the $R_e$-z relations based on our bootstrap Monte Carlo method (Section \ref{sec:size_evo}). ** Bottom:** Differing from the top-left panel, here we plot individual quiescent galaxies to the size-evolution diagram. Like previous figures, GS-9209 is marked with the orange square. (*fig:size_evo*)

**Figure 4. -** Rest-frame 1$\micron$ sizes of the $z>3$ quiescent galaxies from different methods. The $x$-axis shows the fiducial measurements in this work (Section \ref{sec:galfit}). The $y$-axis shows the measurements from alternative methods detailed in Section \ref{sec:test_re_zgt3}, including using (1) a different morphological fitting tool {\sc Lenstronomy}(black circles), (2) {\sc Galfit} but fixing Sérsic index $n=1$(blue squares) or $n=4$(red squares) during the fit and (3) a nonparametric method with the Richardson–Lucy deconvolution (orange triangles). The main purpose here is to compare the sizes from different methodologies, we thus do not estimate uncertainties for the $y$-axis. The dashed line marks the one-to-one relation, and the dotted lines mark the 2 times above/below the one-to-one relation. For the vast majority of the $z>3$ quiescent galaxies, the relative difference in sizes from different methods is $<50\%$.  (*fig:size_zgt3*)
