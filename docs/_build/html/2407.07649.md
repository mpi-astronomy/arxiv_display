**Abstract:** ${Current ALMA surveys often underestimate protoplanetary disk sizes as many disks have extended low surface-brightness regions that fall below ALMA's detection limits. To effectively capture faint millimeter continuum emission in these outer regions, increased sensitivity is required.}$ In order to gain insights on the ${connection between disk structure and}$ planet formation, we aim to uncover ${continuum}$ emission in the outer regions of the disk around TW Hya. ${Additionally, we aim to investigate the evolution of this disk by studying its dust properties.}$ We present Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of TW Hya at 0.65 mm with $\sim$ 0.5 arcsecond angular resolution, together with high angular resolution archival ${observations}$ at 0.87 mm, 1.3 mm, 2.1 mm and 3.1 mm. We constrain the outer disk emission ${with both image-plane retrieval, and visibility-plane modeling with non-parametric and parametric fitting tools.}$ Our results confirm emission in the outer disk regions of TW Hya (60 au $\leq$ R $\leq$ 110 au) at 0.65 mm, 0.87 mm and 1.3 mm. ${With image-plane retrieval}$ , we resolve the new continuum gap and ring, namely D79 and B86, at 0.87 mm and 1.3 mm. ${With visibility-plane modeling}$ , we also detect this substructure at 0.65 mm, and it is consistent in location with the outer ring proposed by \citealp{ilee}{at the 1$\sigma$ level} . ${Furthermore, it}$ has a high spectral index of 3.7, which may indicate dust grain sizes $\ll$ 1 mm. It may be a dust trap or a traffic jam, that has a flux density of $\sim$ 60 mJy and a mass (1.59 $M_\oplus$ ) that accounts for up to 2 \% of the dust disk at 0.65 mm. We confirm the existence of a faint ring in the outer regions of TW Hya at multiple millimeter wavelengths. ${With visibility-plane modeling, we are able to set constrains that are 3 times better than the resolution of our Band 8 observations.}$
