**Figure 7. -** Kiel and colour-magnitude diagrams for each of the MMR subgroups. *Top panel:* Surface gravity *\emph{vs*} effective temperature [$\log(g)$*\emph{vs*}$T_{\rm{eff}}$] for the five MMR subgroups, in the same colours as Fig. \ref{fig:abund_lvplot}, in the shape of 2D kernel density plots with their respective scatter markers. In grey we display the Solar group parameters for comparison. Isochrones for the maximum, median, and minimum ages (according to Table \ref{tab:mmr_subgs_ages}) are also displayed as dashed, straight, and dotted lines, respectively. All isochrones shown are in terms of the median values of [Fe/H] shown in Table \ref{tab:mmr_subgs}. The stars  shown  have a distribution of metallicities that are not shown in the isochrones. *Bottom panel*: Equivalent CMD of the top panel. The CMD uses *JHK$_s$* absolute magnitudes from 2MASS, which were used by unidam to estimate the ages. (*fig:logg_teff_kde*)

**Figure 1. -** Median eccentricities ($\langle e \rangle$) shown as a 1D Gaussian kernel densities for all the MMR subgroups (6 to 10). Medians for each distribution displayed in dashed lines with the same colours as the corresponding distributions. Most of the stars peak at $\langle e \rangle < 0.2$, except for groups 9 and 10 that have $\langle e \rangle$ slightly higher than 2. This is in agreement with \citet[][see their Fig. 3]{Sales2009} and \citet[][see their Fig. 9]{Kordopatis2015}. (*fig:appendix_eccentricities*)
