**Abstract:** In this study, we report conclusive evidence for an ancient star cluster that has been accreted by the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). By leveraging observations from the _Hubble_ Space Telescope ( _HST_ ), we investigate the chrono-dynamical structure of a sample of seven old star clusters within the LMC in a self-consistent way. The multi-epoch nature of the dataset allowed the determination of high-precision proper motions for the clusters. Employing an isochrone-fitting methodology, we additionally infer from the deep high-resolution _HST_ data homogeneous and robust estimates for their distances, ages and metallicities. Supplementing these data with literature line-of-sight velocities, we investigate the full 3-dimensional dynamics of the clusters within the frame of the LMC. With respect to the other clusters in our sample, NGC 1841 depicts a peculiar case. Its position in the age-metallicity plane, that makes it about 1 Gyr younger  than the other metal-poor LMC clusters, but also its dynamical properties with a radial orbit almost perpendicular to the LMC disc plane, clearly advocates for a different origin. We thus conclude that NGC 1841 has likely been accreted by the LMC from a smaller galaxy. The other clusters in our sample show disc-like kinematics, with the case of NGC 2210 being peculiar, based on its inclined orbit. Their coherent age-metallicity relation closely resembles that of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus globular clusters, thus suggesting a similar early evolution for the two dwarf galaxies.  We do not find clear-cut chrono-kinematic evidence that NGC 2005 has been accreted by the LMC as suggested by a previous study based on its chemical abundance pattern. Regardless of its nature, its very old age illustrates that peculiar chemical evolutions already emerge at very early times.

**Figure 5. -** Outline of the clusters' velocities and positions within the LMC. In each panel, NGC 1841 is highlighted with triangle symbol. Panel (a) shows the tangential velocity V$_{\phi}$ as a function of the radial distance from the LMC centre R. Also shown are model circular velocities resulting from a pure NFW profile (orange solid line) and a model composed of a dark matter halo and a stellar disc and bar (green dashed line). The size of the stellar bar is indicated by the vertical dashed line. The radial velocity V$_{R}$ as a function of R is presented in panel (b). Panel (c) illustrates the out-of-plane velocity V$_{Z}$ as a function of R and panel (d) shows the vertical distance from the plane Z as a function of R.
