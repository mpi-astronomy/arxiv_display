**Abstract:** It is established that there exists a direct link between the formation history of star cluster populations and their host galaxies, however, our lacking understanding of star cluster assembly prohibits us to make full use of their ability to trace galaxy evolution. In this work we introduce a new variation of the $\num{2020}$ version of the semi-analytical galaxy formation model " ${\lgalaxies}$ " that includes the formation of star clusters above $10^{4}   \textrm{M}_{\odot}$ and probes different physical assumptions that affect their evolution over cosmic time. We use properties of different galaxy components and localised star formation to determine the bound fraction of star formation in disks. After randomly sampling masses from an environmentally-dependent star cluster initial mass function, we assign to each object a half-mass radius, metallicity, and distance from the galaxy centre. We consider up to $2000$ individual star clusters per galaxy and evolve their properties over time taking into account stellar evolution, two-body relaxation, tidal shocks, dynamical friction, and a re-positioning during galaxy mergers. Our simulation successfully reproduces several observational quantities, such as the empirical relationship between the absolute $V$ -band magnitude of the brightest young star clusters and the host galaxy star formation rate, the mass function of young star clusters, or mean metallicities of the star cluster distributions versus galaxy masses. The simulation reveals great complexity in the $z=0$ star cluster population resulting from differential destruction channels and origins, including _in-situ_ populations in the disk, a major merger-induced heated component in the halo, and accreted star clusters. Model variations point out the importance of e.g. the shape of the star cluster initial mass function or the relationship between the sound speed of cold gas and the star formation rate. Our new model provides new avenues to trace individual star clusters and test cluster-related physics within a cosmological set-up in a computationally efficient manner.

        Bound fraction of star formation, evaluated for $Q_{\mathrm{eff}} = 0.5$, as a function of epicyclic frequency and cold gas surface density.
        Blue solid and dashed black contours give the smoothed distribution (with standard deviation of $1   \textrm{dex}$) of all annuli of all galaxies with $Q_{\mathrm{eff}} < 2$ after running {$\lgalaxies$} tree-files 0-9 and 40-79 on the Millennium and Millennium-II simulations, respectively.
        Contour lines are smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with standard deviation of $0.5   \textrm{dex}$.
        The location of the solar neighbourhood (see \Cref{fig:annuli_frequencies_surface_density_toomre} for details) is marked with a white cross.

**Figure 4. -** 
        Epicyclic frequency, cold gas surface mass density, and the Toomre stability parameter as a function of galactocentric distance for disk- (blue) and bulge-dominated (red) galaxies, defined as having a bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio of $B/T < 0.2$ and $B/T \geq 0.9$, respectively.
        We add for comparison the value of the solar neighbourhood: we calculate $\kappa_{\mathrm{D} ,  \odot} \approx 0.046   \textrm{Myr}^{-1}$, as derived from the Oort constants $A = 15.6   \textrm{km}   \textrm{s}^{-1}   \textrm{kpc}^{-1}$ and $B = -15.8   \textrm{km}   \textrm{s}^{-1}   \textrm{kpc}^{-1}$ taken from \citet{guo2023a}; $\Sigma_{\mathrm{g} ,  \odot} \approx 13   \textrm{M}_{\odot}   \textrm{pc}^{-2}$ from \citet{flynn2006b}; and $Q_{\mathrm{eff} ,  \odot} \approx 1.7$\citep[][with $Q_{\mathrm{s} ,  \odot} \approx 2.7$ and $Q_{\mathrm{g} ,  \odot} \approx 1.5$]{binney2008a}, a typical value for disks \citep[e.g.][]{rafikov2001b,leroy2008a,feng2014a,westfall2014a}.

**Figure 5. -** 
        Absolute $V$-band magnitude of the youngest and most massive star cluster versus the galaxy-averaged star formation rate.
        The galaxy sample is limited to disk-dominated galaxies that have a bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio of $B/T < 0.2$.
        We compare our results to various observations of nearby disk-dominated galaxies (see main text for details).
        For both the simulated data and the observations, we set an age cut of $\tau_{\mathrm{c}} \leq 0.3   \textrm{Gyr}$ on the star clusters.
        _Panel A:_ Full observational and simulated data samples.
        For the simulated data, we show the 1-, 2-, and 3-$\sigma$ intervals.
        _Panel B:_ Same as in the first panel but colour-coding all data point by the host galaxy's stellar mass.
        If no stellar mass estimate is available for observational data points, we show them with gray symbols.
        _Panel C:_ Same as the central panel but colour-coding the data points by the cluster formation efficiency, which is a combination of the bound fraction of star formation and the "cruel cradle effect" \citep{kruijssen2012b,kruijssen2012d} that takes the interaction of a proto-star cluster with its natal environment and nearby giant molecular clouds into account.
        Note that the two outliers, NGC{ }1705 and NGC{ }5238, are starburst galaxies and that their massive star clusters were previously classified as nuclear star clusters \citep{pechetti2020a,hoyer2021a}.
        Nuclear star clusters often exhibit complex formation histories \citep[e.g.][]{spengler2017a,kacharov2018a,fahrion2021a} and cannot easily be compared to our simulated star clusters.
