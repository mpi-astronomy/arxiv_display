**Abstract:** Fast $\gamma$ -ray variability in blazars remains a central puzzle in high-energy astrophysics, challenging standard shock acceleration models. Blazars, a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with jets pointed close to our line of sight, offer a unique view into jet dynamics. Blazar $\gamma$ -ray light curves exhibit rapid, high-amplitude flares that point to promising alternative dissipation mechanisms such as magnetic reconnection. This study uses three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) and resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (ResRMHD) simulations with the PLUTO code to explore magnetic reconnection in turbulent, magnetized plasma columns. Focusing on current-driven kink instabilities, we identify the formation of current sheets due to magnetic reconnection, leading to plasmoid formation. We develop a novel technique combining hierarchical structure analysis and reconnection diagnostics to identify reconnecting current sheets. A statistical analysis of their geometry and orientation reveals a smaller subset that aligns closely with the jet axis, consistent with the jet-in-jet model. These structures can generate relativistically moving plasmoids with significant Doppler boosting, offering a plausible mechanism for the fast flares superimposed on slowly varying blazar light curves. These findings provide new insights into the plasma dynamics of relativistic jets and strengthen the case for magnetic reconnection as a key mechanism in blazar $\gamma$ -ray variability.

For both the case the column 1 represents XZ- and XY- slice plot of current density profile overplotted with identified current sheets ($S_{Ad}   \cap   S_{L}$) from _Astrodendro+LoRD_ method (represented in cyan colour).

**Figure 5. -** Three-dimensional visualization of magnetic field lines (colored using a blue-hot color scale in the unit of $B_0$) overlaid with isosurfaces of fluid density (orange-red color scale in the unit of $\rho_0$) at four different time steps for the simulation run **Res0g5p1**. The snapshots correspond to: (a) $t = 123   t_0$, (b) $t = 153   t_0$, (c) $t = 183   t_0$, and (d) $t = 213   t_0$. These time steps capture the evolution of the magnetic field and the development of kink instability within the jet. (*fig:Res0g5p1_MF_evolution*)
