 model spectrum (black). The model represents $T_{\mathrm{eff}} = \SI{1400}{K}$, $\log{g} = \SI{4.5}{dex}$, and $f_{\mathrm{sed}} = 2$, and has been smoothed to a resolving power of $R=25$. Reduction 2 is used for the SPHERE/IFS spectrum. The atmospheric model reproduces the companion's spectra well, although we find a slight excess in $L^\prime$ that might hint at disequilibrium chemistry from 3--\SI{4}{\mu m}.
