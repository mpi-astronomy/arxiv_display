**Abstract:**            We present the first high-resolution ($\sim$ 0.14") Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 dust continuum and CO molecular line emission observations of the quadruple system HD 34700. In particular, HD 34700AaAb is a spectroscopic binary ($M_{\rm{bin}}=4\,M_\odot$) surrounded by two low-mass companions at large separations. Its circumbinary disk is highly substructured, featuring numerous spiral arms and a large cavity observed in infrared (IR) scattered light. We analyzed the CO line channel and intensity moment maps. By fitting a Keplerian model to the line channel emission, we identified the residual motions and conducted a line spectra analysis. We resolved an asymmetric continuum crescent on top of a dust ring at 0.39" (138 au), colocated with the IR ring. The CO molecule line emissions trace a smaller cavity in gas, whose edge aligns with the inner rim of the ring detected in H$\alpha$ emission at 0.20" (65 au). The $^{12}$CO line emission and kinematics trace highly non-Keplerian motions ($\sim0.1\Delta\upsilon_{\rm kep}$), and these CO spiral features align well with the spiral structures in scattered light. The $^{12}$CO line spectra analysis reveals a streamer above the southeastern disk plane, likely falling onto the disk. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O kinematics largely follow the disk's underlying Keplerian rotation, while $^{13}$CO exhibits tentative signs of anticyclonic vortex flows at the continuum crescent location. Our multimolecular line study suggests that the circumbinary disk of HD 34700A is highly perturbed in its upper layers, possibly warped and influenced by infalling material. While late-stage infall may account for the IR spirals and the formation of the vortex through Rossby wave instability, an embedded massive companion within the cavity may also contribute to these features.

intensity maps for the same cubes, respectively. The brightness temperature was computed using the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation. The white contour in the peak intensity maps encloses 5$\sigma$ of the root-mean-square (RMS) noise of each line. The location of the spectroscopic binary is highlighted with the star. The beam size is shown in the lower left corner for the ALMA observations. (*fig:overview*)

**Figure 7. -** Gas kinematics for the CO molecular lines. Centroid LoS Gaussian moment maps for the data (left columns), Keplerian model (center columns), and data-model residuals (right columns), for the \twCO(top) and \thCO(middle) data, using high-resolution cubes. The geometry of \twCO  and \thCO  models was fixed to the \thCO  disk, which is less perturbed and has a higher S/N than \eiCO . For \eiCO(bottom), we employ the fiducial cube. The respective beam sizes are shown in the lower left corners. In \twCO -residuals, we overplotted the IR contours from Fig. \ref{fig:overview}(a). All panels share the same scale, color bars, and are masked at 4$\sigma$ of their peak intensity map. The innermost beam size is masked in as it was excluded from the fit. (*fig:CO_residuals*)

**Figure 6. -** Line spectra diagnostics. Selected \twCO(black) and \thCO(blue) spectra normalized to their peak extracted at disk locations marked in the center map. The map shows the reduced-$\chi^2$ values (Eq. \ref{eq:chi2}) from the Gaussian moment map fit to the line profile (see accurate fit in panel 1), masked at $5\sigma$. High uncertainties indicate non-Gaussian-shaped line profiles. The line profiles are split by the $v_\mathrm{LSRK}$ into regions that are either blue- or redshifted to the systemic velocity. Pixels 6-9 that exhibit secondary components in their spectra that are tracing an "exodisk" line component (cyan vertical lines), in addition to the underlying rotating disk component (purple lines). The black contours show the IR scattered light as in Fig. \ref{fig:overview} (a) and the dotted lines highlight the disk's minor and major axes.  (*fig:line_profiles*)
