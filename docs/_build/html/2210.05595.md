**Abstract:** The size frequency distribution of exoplanet radii between 1 and 4$R_{\oplus}$is bimodal with peaks  at$\sim$1.4$R_{\oplus}$and$\sim$2.4$R_{\oplus}$, and a valley at$\sim$1.8$R_{\oplus}$. This radius valley separates two classes of planets -- usually referred to as "super-Earths"  and "mini-Neptunes" -- and its origin remains debated. One model proposes that super-Earths are the outcome of photo-evaporation or core-powered mass-loss  stripping the primordial atmospheres of the mini-Neptunes. A contrasting model interprets the radius valley as a dichotomy in the bulk compositions, where super-Earths are  rocky planets and mini-Neptunes are water-ice rich worlds. In this work, we test whether the migration model is consistent with the radius valley and how it distinguishes these views. In the migration model, planets migrate towards the disk inner edge forming a chain of planets locked in resonant configurations. After the gas disk dispersal, orbital instabilities  "break the chains" and promote  late collisions. This model broadly matches the  period-ratio and planet-multiplicity distributions of Kepler planets, and  accounts for resonant chains such as TRAPPIST-1, Kepler-223, and TOI-178. Here, by combining the outcome of planet formation simulations with compositional mass-radius relationships, and assuming complete loss of primordial H-rich atmospheres in late giant-impacts, we show that the migration model accounts for the exoplanet radius valley and the intra-system uniformity ("peas-in-a-pod") of Kepler planets. Our results suggest that planets with sizes of$\sim$1.4$R_{\oplus}$are mostly rocky, whereas  those with sizes of$\sim$2.4$R_{\oplus}$are mostly water-ice rich worlds. Our results do not support an exclusively rocky composition for the cores of mini-Neptunes.

**Figure 8. -** Architecture of planetary systems at the end of our simulations, i.e., after dynamical instabilities have taken place. The horizontal axis shows orbital period, and the y-axis planetary radius as calculate from the mass radius relationships of \cite{zengetal19}.  Planets are shown as individual dots. We only show planets with orbital periods shorter than 100 days. In all these models, more than $\sim$95\% of the resonant chains became unstable after gas disk dispersal. Models A, B, and C are shown from left to right. Points are color-coded according to the planets'
number of late giant impacts (top row of panels), masses (middle row of panels), and ice-mass fractions (right column). We neglect the effects of photo-evaporation and/or other subsequent atmospheric mass-loss in all these cases (see Appendix for simulations where the effects of photoevaporation are included). The dashed lines in the bottom panels show the exoplanet radius valley slope, calculated  as $R =10^{-0.11{\rm log}_{10}(P)+0.4}$ \citep{vaneylenetal18,guptaetal19}. The green background-contours show the kernel density distribution of the planets in our simulations (dots of the figure). (*fig:after_instabilities*)

**Figure 9. -** {\bf Left:}  Planet radius distribution. {\bf Right:} Planet size-ratio  distribution of adjacent planet pairs. These distributions are computed after dynamical instabilities and the breaking of the resonant chains. Exoplanets are shown in gray. Blue shows the outcome of our planet formation simulations. Red shows the outcome of our planet formation simulations including the effects of photo-evaporation. From top-to-bottom, the panel-rows show model A,  B, and  C. For all models, we use the mass-radius relationship of \cite{zengetal19} assuming an uncertainty of 7\% in size and an initial atmosphere-to-core mass ratio of 0.3\%. We build these histograms accounting for uncertainties in radius by generating the possible radius of each planet 100 times. (*fig:distributions*)

**Figure 11. -** Final planetary systems produced in Model-C.  Each line shows one planetary systems. The color-coding indicates the planet composition.  A black-ring around the dot indicates the presence of  atmosphere, and the full-size of the dot scales with its radius. When determining the final planet sizes, we include atmospheric stripping by photo-evaporation after the giant impact phase. Planets atmospheric masses, when present, are assumed to correspond to 0.3\% of the core mass. (*fig:final_systems*)
