**Abstract:**            We analyzed the spatially resolved and global star formation histories (SFHs) for a sample of 25 TNG50-SKIRT Atlas galaxies to assess the feasibility of reconstructing accurate SFHs from Euclid-like data. This study provides a proof of concept for extracting the spatially resolved SFHs of local galaxies with Euclid, highlighting the strengths and limitations of SFH modeling in the context of next-generation galaxy surveys. We used the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code Prospector to model both spatially resolved and global SFHs using parametric and nonparametric configurations. The input consisted of mock ultraviolet--near-infrared photometry derived from the TNG50 cosmological simulation and processed with the radiative transfer code SKIRT. We show that nonparametric SFHs provide a more effective approach to mitigating the outshining effect by recent star formation, offering improved accuracy in the determination of galaxy stellar properties. Also, we find that the nonparametric SFH model at resolved scales closely recovers the stellar mass formation times (within 0.1~dex) and the ground truth values from TNG50, with an absolute average bias of $0.03$~dex in stellar mass and $0.01$~dex in both specific star formation rate and mass-weighted age. In contrast, larger offsets are estimated for all stellar properties and formation times when using a simple $\tau$-model SFH, at both resolved and global scales, highlighting its limitations. These results emphasize the critical role of nonparametric SFHs in both global and spatially resolved analyses, as they better capture the complex evolutionary pathways of galaxies and avoid the biases inherent in simple parametric models.

**Figure 6. -** Comparisons of the spatially resolved stellar population properties for 6958 pixel bins in the 25 sample galaxies derived from spatially resolved SED fitting with a nonparametric SFH model. The depicted physical properties include the stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma_\star$), the SFR surface density ($\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$), the stellar metallicity ($Z_\star$), and the mass-weighted stellar age ($t_\mathrm{\star, mw}$). The colors indicate the average trend with the dust optical depth in the $V$ band ($\hat{\tau}_\mathrm{dust,  2}$), calculated with the {\tt LOESS} method. Each hexbin includes a minimum of five points. Contours enclose 20\%, 50\%, and 80\% of the total data. The dashed orange line represents the one-to-one relation. The Spearman’s correlation coefficient ($\rho$), measured bias (average offset $\mu$), and scatter (standard deviation $\sigma$) relative to the ground truth from TNG50 are indicated in the legend of each panel.

**Figure 8. -** Examples of SFR surface density ($\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$) maps and SFH models for ten galaxies in our TNG50-{\tt SKIRT} Atlas sample. Left panel: $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ map for each galaxy, as estimated with {\tt Prospector}. Right panel: Comparison of various global SFH models to the ground truth SFH from TNG50. Specifically, we show the global nonparametric SFH inferred from our fiducial spatially resolved run (SFH$_\mathrm{res, np}$; orange), the global parametric SFH inferred from the spatially resolved map (SFH$_\mathrm{res, \tau}$; pink), the nonparametric SFH derived from fitting the integrated photometry (SFH$_\mathrm{glob, np}$; yellow), the global parametric SFH based on a simple $\tau$-model (SFH$_\mathrm{glob, \tau}$; blue), and the true global SFH from the TNG50 resolved map (SFH$_\mathrm{res, TNG50}$; green) (*fig:fig_7*)

**Figure 11. -** Differences in the global stellar properties for the four different SFH models with respect to the ground truth global values from the TNG50 simulation. From left to right: $M_\star$, sSFR, and $t_\mathrm{\star, mw}$. The properties were derived through SED fitting under four different configurations: spatially resolved fitting with a nonparametric SFH$_\mathrm{res, np}$(orange), spatially resolved SED fitting with a simple $\tau$-model SFH$_\mathrm{res, \tau}$(pink), global fitting with a nonparametric SFH$_\mathrm{glob, np}$(yellow), and a global fitting with a simple $\tau$-model SFH$_\mathrm{glob, \tau}$(blue). Typical uncertainties for each configuration are shown in the bottom-left corner of each panel. Star-forming galaxies are indicated with stars, while quiescent galaxies with points. The bottom panels show the residual distributions of each stellar property. The measured bias (average offset) and scatter (standard deviation) are indicated in the legends of the panels. The properties inferred from the spatially resolved and integrated nonparametric SFHs are in best agreement with the ground truth values. (*fig:fig_10*)
