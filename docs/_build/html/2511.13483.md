**Abstract:** The atmospheres of warm gas giants can be readily characterized through transmission and emission spectroscopy. WASP-80 b is one such exoplanet, with an unusually low density that is in tension with the metal-rich composition expected for a planet of this mass.   We aim to derive precise constraints on WASP-80 b’s bulk metal mass fraction, atmospheric composition, and thermal structure.  We conducted a suite of retrievals using three approaches: traditional interior-only, atmosphere-only, and joint interior–atmosphere retrievals. We coupled the open-source models GASTLI and petitRADTRANS, which describe planetary structure and thermal evolution, and atmospheric chemistry and clouds, respectively. Our retrievals combine mass and age with panchromatic spectra from JWST and HST in both transmission (0.5–4 $\mu$ m) and emission (1–12 $\mu$ m) as observational constraints.   We identify two fiducial scenarios. In the first, WASP-80 b has an internal temperature consistent with its age in the absence of external heating sources, and its atmosphere is in chemical equilibrium, with an atmospheric metallicity M/H = 2.75 $^{+0.88}_{-0.56}\times$ solar, a bulk metal mass fraction $Z_{\rm planet}=0.12\pm0.02$ , and a core mass $M_{\rm core} = 3.49^{+3.49}_{-1.59}  M_{\oplus}$ . In the second scenario, WASP-80 b may be inflated by an additional heat source -- possibly induced by magnetic fields -- with an atmospheric metallicity M/H = 10.00 $^{+8.20}_{-4.75}\times$ solar, $Z_{\rm planet}=0.28\pm0.11$ , and $M_{\rm core}=31.8^{+21.3}_{-17.5}  M_{\oplus}$ . The super-solar M/H and sub-solar C/O ratios in both scenarios suggest late pebble or planetesimal accretion, while additional heating is required to reconcile the data with the more massive core predicted by the core accretion paradigm. In general, joint retrievals are inherently affected by a degeneracy between atmospheric chemistry and internal structure. Together with flexible cloud treatment and an unweighted likelihood, this leads to larger uncertainties in bulk and atmospheric compositions than previously claimed.

**Figure 14. -** Pressure-Temperature (PT) profiles of WASP-80 b as constrained by four of our joint retrievals. The shaded regions indicate the 1, 2, and 3$\sigma$ regions of the retrieval, while solid lines correspond to the mean. Black lines highlight self-consistent models from [Mollière and Bouwman (2017)](), [Acuña, et. al (2024)]() of a clear atmosphere with solar composition at $T_{\rm int}$ = 100 (dashed) and 500 K (dotted) for comparison. **Left**: The difference between JR3 and JR5 shows the effect of adding the transmission spectrum to JR3, which incorporates emission spectra plus the mass and radius. The transmission spectrum reduces significantly the uncertainties in thermal structure. **Center**: Comparing JR6 and JR5 allows us to study the effect of including the age to the retrieval. JR6 is the most-data complete of the joint retrievals, since it incorporates both transmission and emission, plus the mass and age. If the age is removed (JR5), the temperature in the deep atmosphere increases. **Right**: The comparison between JR5 and JR5$^{\ast}$ illustrates the effect of assuming equilibrium chemistry in the joint retrieval. If we relax the assumption of equilibrium chemistry in JR5 by changing to a free chemistry model (JR5$^{\ast}$), the temperature decreases in the deep interior. (*fig:ptprofile_joint*)
