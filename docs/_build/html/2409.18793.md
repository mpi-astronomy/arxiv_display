**Abstract:** Exoplanets form from circumstellar protoplanetary discs whose fundamental properties (notably their extent, composition, mass, temperature and lifetime) depend on the host star properties, such as their mass and luminosity. B-stars are among the most massive stars and their protoplanetary discs test extreme conditions for exoplanet formation. This paper investigates the frequency of giant planet companions around young B-stars (median age of 16 Myr) in the Scorpius-Centaurus association, the closest association containing a large population of B-stars. We systematically search for massive exoplanets with the high-contrast direct imaging instrument SPHERE using the data from the BEAST survey, that targets an homogeneous sample of young B-stars from the wide Sco-Cen association. We derive accurate detection limits in case of non-detections. We found evidence in previous papers for two substellar companions around 42 stars. The masses of these companions are straddling the $\sim$ 13 Jupiter mass deuterium burning limit but their mass ratio with respect to their host star is close to that of Jupiter. We derive a frequency of such massive planetary mass companions around B stars of $11_{-5}^{+7}$ \% , accounting for the survey sensitivity. The discoveries of substellar companions $\bcen$ b and $\mds$ B happened after only few stars in the survey had been observed, raising the possibility that massive Jovian planets might be common around B-stars. However our statistical analysis show that the occurrence rate of such planets is similar around B-stars and around solar-type stars of similar age, while B-star companions exhibit low mass ratios and larger semi-major axis.

**Figure 4. -** Average detection probability of a companion of given mass/sma in the BEAST intermediary survey using the cond atmospheric model. The two detected planets in this survey are also represented with the mass / sma extracted from [Janson, Gratton and Rodet (2021)]() and [Squicciarini, et. al (2021)](). Jupiter is also added to provide comparison. In the case of $\bcen$ b, no semi-major axis estimation is available, so we represented its projected separation. (*fig:sample_detmaps*)
