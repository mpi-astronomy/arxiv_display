**Abstract:** We report MIRI-JWST coronagraphic observations at 11.3 and 15.5 $\mic$ of the debris disk around the young star HD 106906. The wavelength range is sensitive to the thermal	  emission of the dust heated by the central star. The observations were made to characterize the structure of the disk through the thermal emission, to search for clues to the presence of a central void of dust particles, and to derive the mass of the dust and the temperature	  distribution. Another goal was also to constrain the size distribution of the grains. The data were reduced and calibrated  using the JWST pipeline. The  analysis was based on a forward-modeling of the images using a multiparameter radiative	  transfer model coupled to an optical code for coronagraphy processing. The disk is clearly detected at both wavelengths. The slight asymmetry is	  geometrically consistent with the asymmetry observed in the near-IR, but it is inconsistent the brightness distribution. The observed	  structure is well reproduced with a model of a disk (or belt) with a critical radius 70 au, a mildly	  inward-increasing density (index 2) and a steeper decrease outward (index -6).	This indication of a filled disk inside the critical radius is inconsistent with sculpting from an	  inner massive planet.	  The size distribution of the grains that cause the mid-IR emission is  well	  constrained by the flux ratio at the two wavelengths : 0.45 -- 10 $\mic$ and 0.65 -- 10 $\mic$ for silicate and graphite grains, respectively. The minimum size is consistent with predictions	  of blowout through radiative pressure. We derive a mass of the dust that causes the mid-IR emission of 3.3 -- 5.0 $10^{-3} \Mearth$ .	  When the larger grains (up to 1 cm) that cause the	  millimeter emission are included, we extrapolate this mass to 0.10 -- 0.16 $\Mearth$ .	  We point out to that this is fully consistent with ALMA observations of the disk	  in terms of dust mass and of its millimeter flux. We estimate the average dust temperature	  in the planetesimal belt to be 74 K, but the temperature range within the whole disk is rather wide: from 40 to 130 K.

	   	distribution. The ratio $R_f$ is deduced from the model after integration
	   	of the flux in the considered size range.
	   	$R_f$  is plotted for a selection of different size ranges, all following a distribution in $a^{-3.5}$.
     Each segment depicts a range that is plotted in blue for silicate grains and in orange for graphite grains.
     The  dots correspond to single sizes of silicate grains.
	 The two retained ranges are indicated by thicker dash-dot segments.
     The  range of ratios deduced from observations is indicated by
        shaded purple. (*fig:F7*)
