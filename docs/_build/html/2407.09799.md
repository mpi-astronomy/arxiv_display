**Abstract:** Previous studies of the chemo-kinematic properties of stars in the Galactic bulge have revealed a puzzling trend. Along the bulge minor axis,  and close to the Galactic plane, metal-rich stars display a higher line-of-sight velocity dispersion compared to metal-poor stars, while at higher latitudes metal-rich stars have lower velocity dispersions than metal-poor stars, similar to what is found in the Galactic disc. In this work, we re-examine this issue, by studying the dependence of line-of-sight velocity dispersions on metallicity and latitude in the latest APOGEE Data Release 17, confirming the results of previous works. We then analyse an $N$ -body simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy, also taking into account observational biases introduced by the APOGEE selection function. We show that the inversion in the line-of-sight velocity dispersion-latitude relation observed in the Galactic bulge -- where the velocity dispersion of metal-rich stars becomes greater than that of metal-poor stars as latitude decreases -- can be reproduced by our model.  We show that this inversion is a natural consequence of a scenario in which the bulge is  a boxy/peanut-shaped structure, whose metal-rich and metal-poor  stars mainly originate from the thin and thick disc of the Milky Way, respectively. Due to their cold kinematics, metal-rich, thin disc stars, are efficiently trapped in the boxy/peanut bulge, and, at low latitudes, show a strong barred morphology, which - given the bar orientation with respect to the Sun-Galactic centre direction  - results in high velocity dispersions which are larger than those attained by the metal-poor populations. Extremely metal-rich stars in the Galactic bulge, which have received renewed attention in the literature, do follow the same trends as those of the metal-rich populations. The  line-of-sight velocity-latitude relation observed in the Galactic bulge for metal-poor and metal-rich stars are thus both an effect of the intrinsic nature of the Galactic bulge (i.e. mostly secular) and of the angle at which we observe it from the Sun.

**Figure 4. -** Maps of the velocity dispersion maps for the bar-oriented $\sigma_{v_{Xb}}$(_left panel_) and $\sigma_{v_{Yb}}$(_right panel_) components. Each population (metal-rich, metal-intermediate and metal-poor) correspond to a column in each panel, and different height cuts are represented on each row (0 kpc < |Z| < 0.25 kpc, 0.25 kpc < |Z| < 0.5 kpc and 0.5 kpc < |Z| < 1 kpc). The axis are bar-oriented, isodensity contours are shown as colored lines, and a 1.5 kpc region around the galactic centre is shown as a dotted black circle. (*fig:xy_v*)
