**Abstract:** Dust grains in protoplanetary disks are the building blocks of planets. Investigating the dust composition and size, and their variation over time, is crucial for understanding the planet formation process. The PDS 70 disk is so far the only protoplanetary disk with concrete evidence for the presence of young planets. Mid-infrared spectra were obtained for PDS 70 by the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2007 and 2022, respectively. In this work, we investigate the dust mineralogy through a detailed decomposition of the observed mid-infrared spectra. The results show that both the dust size and crystallinity increased by a factor of about two during the two epochs of observation, indicating evident dust processing in the terrestrial planet-forming region of the PDS 70 disk. The dust size ( ${\sim} 0.8 \mu{\rm m}$ ) and crystallinity ( ${\sim} 6\%$ ) in the PDS 70 disk are similar to those of other disks, which implies that the two nascent planets, PDS 70b and PDS 70c located at radial distances of ${\sim} 22 {\rm AU}$ and ${\sim} 34 {\rm AU}$ , do not have a significant impact on the dust processing in the inner disk. The flux densities at $\lambda{\gtrsim} 16 \mu{\rm m}$ measured by JWST/MIRI are only 60 \% of those obtained by Spitzer/IRS. Based on self-consistent radiative transfer modeling, we found that such a strong variability in mid-infrared fluxes can be produced by adjustments to the dust density distribution and structure of the inner disk probably induced by planet-disk interaction.

**Figure 3. -** Comparison between model spectra (black line) and observed spectra (red line) of PDS 70. The upper panel shows the IRS spectrum, whereas the MIRI spectrum is shown in the bottom panel. For the model spectra, we also mark the contribution by the underlying continuum and dust emission from the disk surface layer, see Eq. \ref{eq:newFnu}. The vertical bars on the IRS and MIRI spectra refer to the observational uncertainties. Note that the uncertainties of the IRS spectrum are barely seen. The vertical bar shown in the upper left corner of each panel indicates the finally-converged uncertainty obtained from the iterative fitting process, see Sect. \ref{sec:fitapp}. (*fig:fluxCom*)

**Figure 5. -** Radiative transfer models of PDS 70. _ Left panel: _ dust surface densities of model A (grey line) and model B (black line). Model parameters are given in Table \ref{tab:paras}. Note that the surface densities of the outer disk for both models are identical. _ Middle panel: _ comparison of infrared spectrum between model and observation. The IRS data is indicated with the red line, whereas the blue line represents the MIRI spectrum. _ Right panel: _ comparison between the model SED and photometry from  optical to millimeter wavelengths. Data points are collected from Gregorio-Hetem et al. Gregorio-Hetem1992, Hashimoto et al. Hashimoto2012, Benisty et al. Benisty2021, and Facchini et al. Facchini2021. (*fig:surdens*)

**Figure 2. -** Mass absorption coefficients of amorphous silicates of olivine type (left panel) and pyroxene type (middle panel), and crystalline forsterite (right panel). The solid lines show the results for the grain size being $0.1 \mu{\rm m}$. The dashed lines indicate the results for $2 \mu{\rm m}$-sized dust grains. The dotted lines display the results for $5 \mu{\rm m}$-sized dust grains. The results are calculated using the theory of distribution of hollow spheres Min2005. (*fig:kappa*)
