**Abstract:** The study of the atmosphere of exoplanets orbiting white dwarfs is a largely unexplored field. With WD 0806-661 b, we present the first deep dive into the atmospheric physics and chemistry of a cold exoplanet around a white dwarf. We observed WD 0806-661 b using JWST's Mid-InfraRed Instrument Low-Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI-LRS), covering the wavelength range from 5 -- 12 $\mu \rm{m}$ , and the Imager, providing us with 12.8, 15, 18 and 21 $\mu$ m photometric measurements. We carried the data reduction of those datasets, tackling second-order effects to ensure a reliable retrieval analysis. Using the TauREx retrieval code, we inferred the pressure-temperature structure, atmospheric chemistry, mass, and radius of the planet. The spectrum of WD 0806-661 b is shaped by molecular absorption of water, ammonia, and methane, consistent with a cold Jupiter atmosphere, allowing us to retrieve their abundances. From the mixing ratio of water, ammonia and methane we derive $\rm{C/O} = 0.34 \pm 0.06$ , $\rm{C/N} = 14.4 ^{+2.5}_{-1.8}$ and $\rm{N/O} = 0.023 \pm 0.004$ and the ratio of detected metals as proxy for metallicity. We also derive upper limits for the abundance of CO and $\rm{CO_2}$ ( $1.2\cdot10^{-6} \rm{ and } 1.6\cdot10^{-7}$ respectively), which were not detected by our retrieval models. While our interpretation of WD 0806-661 b's atmosphere is mostly consistent with our theoretical understanding, some results -- such as the lack of evidence for water clouds, an apparent increase in the mixing ratio of ammonia at low pressure, or the retrieved mass at odds with the supposed age -- remain surprising and require follow-up observational and theoretical studies to be confirmed.

We clearly see the right to left gradient, and the target's signal. Right panel: line by line median for each of the two exposures and associated second order polynomial fit.   (*fig:appendixA2*)

**Figure 3. -** Top panel : MIRI fixed slit LRS spectrum of WD 661 b (black) and best fit model from TauREx (blue). The black rectangle in the top left-hand corner shows the $\lambda = [11, 24] \rm{\mu m}$ range. The red lines are the $\lambda \in \{12.8, 15, 18, 21\} \mu$m photometric points from MIRI. They are not included in the retrieval, just plotted over the best fit. The navy line at the same places corresponds to the best fit, binned to the resolution of these photometric points. The bottom left-hand panel displays the residuals between the LRS data and the best fit, for which the root-mean-standard-deviation is $1.247$ (*fig:LRS&fit*)
