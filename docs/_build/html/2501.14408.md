**Abstract:** The $\Euclid$ \/ mission is generating a vast amount of imaging data in four broadband filters at high angular resolution. This will allow the detailed study of mass, metallicity, and stellar populations across galaxies, which will constrain their formation and evolutionary pathways. Transforming the $\Euclid$ \/ imaging for large samples of galaxies into maps of physical parameters in an efficient and reliable manner is an outstanding challenge. We investigate the power and reliability of machine learning techniques to extract the distribution of physical parameters within well-resolved galaxies. We focus on estimating stellar mass surface density, mass-averaged stellar metallicity and age. We generate noise-free, synthetic high-resolution ( $100{\rm   pc} \times100 {\rm   pc}$ ) imaging data in the $\Euclid$ \/ photometric bands for a set of 1154 galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. The images are generated with the SKIRT radiative transfer code, taking into account the complex 3D distribution of stellar populations and interstellar dust attenuation. We use a machine learning framework to map the idealised mock observational data to the physical parameters on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We find that stellar mass surface density can be accurately recovered with a $\leq 0.130 {\rm  dex}$ scatter.Conversely, stellar metallicity and age estimates are, as expected, less robust, but still contain significant information which originates from underlying correlations at a sub-kpc scale between stellar mass surface density and stellar population properties. As a corollary, we show that TNG50 follows a spatially resolved mass-metallicity relation that is consistent with observations. Due to its relatively low computational and time requirements, that is a time-frame of minutes without dedicated high performance computing infrastructure once it has been trained, our method allows for fast and robust estimates of the stellar mass surface density distributions of nearby galaxies from four-filter $\Euclid$ \/ imaging data. Equivalent estimates of stellar population properties (stellar metallicity and age) are less robust but still hold value as first-order approximations across large samples.

**Figure 4. -** Predictions for $\mass$(top), $Z_{\star}$(middle), and $t_{\star}$(bottom) using the four \Euclid\/ bands as the input features for the three models: linear regression (left), random forest (middle), and deep neural network (right) as a function of their true value. Diagonal line marks the identity, the additional two dashed lines mark the limit for the catastrophic outliers (instances where the predicted value is two times larger or smaller than the true value). Running medians, with their 16$^\text{th}$ and 84$^\text{th}$ percentiles are marked with large blue points with error bars. (*fig:models_all*)

**Figure 6. -** Full disc map of galaxy TNG 539333 (O5 projection) for $\logten \left[$\mass$ /{\rm \left(M_{\odot} pc^{-2}\right)}\right]$(left), $\logten \left(Z_{\star} / {\rm Z_{\odot}}\right) $(middle), and $\logten \left(t_{\star} / {\rm Gyr}\right)$(right) as an example of a more accurate model. From top to bottom, top row shows the actual values for each property, followed by the model created by a deep neural network algorithm on four \Euclid\/ bands, and the third row shows the residuals, where points in red (blue) represent pixels where the actual values are higher (lower) than those in the model. Histograms contained in the lower right corner of the residual maps show the distribution of error prediction ($\logten$$y_i$ - $\logten$$\hat{y}_i$, where $y_i$ is the actual $i$-th value, and $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted $i$-th value of the pixel), dashed lines mark the 16$^\text{th}$ and 84$^\text{th}$ percentile of the distribution for the pixels contained within the dashed circle of a 12 kpc radius. Bottom row shows radial profiles for the true (red) and predicted (blue) values where large points mark the median, and error bars mark the 16$^\text{th}$ and 84$^\text{th}$ percentile of the distribution contained within the radial bin, as well as their residuals plotted underneath.
