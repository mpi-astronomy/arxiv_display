**Abstract:** The A1V star $\gamma$ Oph, at a distance of 29.7 pc, is known from Spitzer imaging to host a debris disk with a large radial extent and from its spectral energy distribution to host inner warm dust. We imaged $\gamma$ Oph with JWST/MIRI at 15 and 25.5 $\mu$ m, which reveal smooth and radially broad emission that extends to a radius of at least 250 au at 25.5 $\mu$ m. In contrast to JWST findings of an inner small-grain component with distinct ringed substructures in Fomalhaut and Vega, the mid-infrared radial profile combined with prior ALMA imaging suggests a radially broad steady-state collisional cascade with the same grain size distribution throughout the disk. This further suggests that the system is populated by a radially broad planetesimal belt from tens of au or less to well over 200 au, rather than a narrow planetesimal belt from which the observed dust is displaced to appear broad. The disk is also found to be asymmetric, which could be modelled by a stellocentric offset corresponding to a small eccentricity of $\sim$ 0.02. Such a disk eccentricity could be induced by a mildly eccentric $<10 M_\mathrm{Jup}$ giant planet outside 10 au, or a more eccentric companion up to stellar mass at a few au, without producing a resolvable radial gap in the disk.

**Figure 5. -** Gallery of nonparametric and parametric models fitted to the MIRI F2550W PSF-subtracted (assuming stellar SED flux) image of $\gamma$ Oph. Each group of 3 panels displays the PSF-convolved disk-only model image (i.e., stellar component not included, displayed on a logarithmic colour scale, to be compared with the top-left panel in Fig. \ref{fig:obs}), disk-only deconvolved and deprojected radial surface brightness (S.B.) and optical depth ($\tau$) profiles and the residual image (data $-$ model). "Offset" indicates that the geometric centre of the disk is offset relative to the star in the model, and is included as (two) free parameters in the model (along two spatial axes). The displacement vector of the disk centre relative to the star is indicated with blue arrows. All radial profile panels are plotted with the same vertical scaling, which span from 0 to 1.8 mJy/arcsec$^2$. For the \texttt{rave} radial profile panel (panel a), the azimuthally averaged profile of the PSF-subtracted (assuming the stellar flux of the best-fit grid point in the 4D \texttt{rave} grid) observations and the PSF-convolved best-fit disk model are overplotted, as this is the 1D quantity that \texttt{rave} directly fits to. Where multiple Gaussian components are invoked (panels e and f), the constituent Gaussian components are individually overplotted. Uncertainties are indicated with shaded regions for the main deconvolved profiles, but these are generally too narrow to be visible for the parametric models. The per-pixel RMS noise measured from the background is 0.07 mJy/arcsec$^2$. North is oriented upwards and east to the left.

The photometric data points were collected from _Hipparcos_ (Hipparcos1997, [H\og, et. al 2000](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000A&A...355L..27H)) , the [ and Mermilliod (2006)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006yCat.2168....0M) UBV catalogue, 2MASS  ([Cutri, et. al 2003](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003tmc..book.....C)) , _Gaia_ ([Gaia Collaboration, et. al 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A&A...616A...1G)) , AKARI  ([Ishihara, et. al 2010](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010A&A...514A...1I)) , WISE  ([Wright, et. al 2010](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AJ....140.1868W)) , _Spitzer_ ([Su, et. al 2006](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...653..675S), [Chen, et. al 2014](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJS..211...25C), [IRSA and SSC 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ipac.data.I433I)) , _Herschel_ ([Pilbratt, et. al 2010](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010A&A...518L...1P), [Pawellek, et. al 2014](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...792...65P), [Mo\'or, et. al 2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.447..577M)) , JCMT  ([Holland, et. al 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.470.3606H)) , APEX  ([Nilsson, et. al 2010](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010A&A...518A..40N))  and ALMA  ([Matr\`a, et. al 2025](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025A&A...693A.151M), [Marino, et. al 2026](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202556489)) . The $F_*$ points represent the fitted central component flux under then double-power-law-with-offset model at 25 $\mu$m and the Gaussian-with-offset model at 15 $\mu$m. The stellar spectrum corresponds to a Phoenix stellar model  ([Husser, et. al 2013](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A&A...553A...6H))  with $T_\mathrm{eff} = 9050$ K and $\log(g) = 3.9$. The SED models of the disk are overplotted, including those derived using \texttt{rave} on the ALMA 0.87 mm and JWST 25 $\mu$m images, both with the same grain composition and size distribution as described in Section \ref{sec:parametric}.

**Figure 2. -** Constraints on the mass (left axis), eccentricity (right axis) and semimajor axis of a hypothetical planet required to explain the stellocentric offset of the disk. Lower bounds in the mass--semimajor axis parameter space are plotted with thick lines and upper bounds with thin lines. Origins of lower bounds include a sufficiently fast secular perturbation timescale such that the disk becomes eccentric within the age of the system ($t_\mathrm{sec} = \mathrm{age}$), and a sufficiently massive planet to overcome the disk's gravity ($M_\mathrm{disk}$). Upper bounds are set by the lack of a radial gap detected in MIRI observations, either due to the gap being too narrow ($\Delta a_\mathrm{gap}$), or due to a gap having not yet been carved by the planet within the age of the system ($t_\mathrm{clear} = \mathrm{age}$). The shaded region simultaneously satisfies all such constraints described.
    The eccentricity required of the planet to excite a forced eccentricity of 0.02 in the disk at 50 au is overplotted on a separate vertical axis with a black dashed line ($e$).  (*fig:planets*)
