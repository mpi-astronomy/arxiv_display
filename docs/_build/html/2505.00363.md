**Abstract:** Planet formation via core accretion involves the growth of solids that can accumulate to form planetary cores.  There are a number of barriers to the collisional growth of solids in protostellar discs, one of which is the drift, or metre, barrier.  Solid particles experience a drag force that will tend to cause them to drift towards the central star in smooth, laminar discs, potentially removing particles before they grow large enough to decouple from the disc gas. Here we present 3-dimensional, shearing box simulations that explore the dynamical evolution of solids in a protostellar disc that is massive enough for the gravitational instability to manifest as spiral density waves.  We expand on earlier work by considering a range of particle sizes and find that the spirals can still enhance the local solid density by more than an order of magnitude, potentially aiding grain growth.  Furthermore, if solid particles have enough mass, and the particle size distribution extends to sufficiently large particle sizes, the solid component of the disc can undergo direct gravitational collapse to form bound clumps with masses typically between $1$ and $10$ M $_\oplus$ . Thus, the concentration of dust in a self-gravitating disc could bypass the size barrier for collisional growth and directly form planetary cores early in the lifetime of the disc.

**Figure 9. -** Surface density structure for all the particles in the simulation in which the particles have a mass $10^{-4}$(top left), $10^{-3}$(top right), $0.003$(middle left), $0.007$(middle right), $0.01$(bottom left) and $0.025$(bottom right) that of the gas. The particle self-gravity, and the backreaction on the gas, is included, and the particle size distribution covers 4 orders of magnitude in particle size with representative Stokes numbers ranging from $\mathrm{St} \sim 0.02$ to $\mathrm{St} \sim 200$. Apart from the $m_{\rm d} = 0.025 m_{\rm g}$ simulation, these are all at $t\Omega = 300$. For $m_{\rm d} = 0.025 m_{\rm g}$ the high densities of the clumps reduced the timestep and the simulation was stopped at $t \Omega = 220$. The red circles in the bottom two panels highlight dense clumps that have formed in these simulations. (*fig:ptclsfullrange*)

**Figure 1. -** Gas density structure in the midplane (top panel) and a vertical slice through the disc at $x = 0$(bottom panel) at $t \Omega = 300$.  The disc has settled into a quasi-steady, self-gravitating state with spiral density waves and the simulation is clearly able to capture the vertical structure in the gas disc. (*fig:refgas*)

**Figure 2. -** Surface density structure of the particle disc at $t \Omega = 300$, for the full size range of solid particles from the test particle simulation.  The top panel shows the particle surface density in the disc midplane, while the bottom panel shows the surface, or column, density projected on to the xz-plane. (*fig:refdust*)
