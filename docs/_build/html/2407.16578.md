**Abstract:** **The majority of stars in today's Universe reside within spheroids, which are bulges of spiral galaxies and elliptical galaxies Baldry2006,  Gadotti2009**.Their formation is still an unsolved problem\cite{Brooks2016, Oser2012, Peng2010. Infrared/submm-bright galaxies at high redshiftsBlain2002 have long been suspected to be related to spheroids formationLilly1999, Archibald2002,  Dunne2003, DeLucia2006, Tacconi2008, Brisbin2017. Proving this connection has been hampered so far by heavy dust obscuration when focusing on their stellar emissionLeBail2023, Cardona-Torres2023, Gillman2023 or by  methodologies and limited signal-to-noise ratios when looking at  submm wavelengthsGullberg2019, Hodge2019.Here we show that spheroids are directly generated by star formation within the cores of highly luminous starburst galaxies in the distant Universe. This follows from the ALMA submillimeter surface brightness profiles which deviate significantly from those of exponential disks, and from the skewed-high axis-ratio distribution, both derived with a novel analysis technique. These galaxies are fully triaxial rather than flat disks: scale-height ratios are 0.5 on average and $>0.6$ for  most spatially compact systems. These observations, supported by simulations, reveal a cosmologically relevant pathway for in-situ spheroid formation through  starbursts likely preferentially triggered by interactions (and mergers) acting on galaxies fed by non co-planar gas accretion streams.}

**Figure 1. -** \small**Physical properties of submm-bright galaxies,  measured from fitting Spergel light profiles to the visibilities.****Left**: distributions of measured parameters. **a**, half-light radius $R_{\rm e}$. **c**, comparison of the distributions of the observed axis ratio _q_ between our sample of galaxies (green) and local (U)LIRGs (purple). As reference, we plot the expected _q_ distributions for disks with a scale-height (C/A) of 0.1 (blue curve) and spheroids with a scale-height of 0.7 (red curve). **e**, Spergel index $\nu$. The blue curves in panel **e** represent the intrinsic distribution of $\nu$, which was modeled using a combination of two Gaussian functions, while the orange curve represents the best-fit $\nu$ distribution of sample galaxies by taking into account the uncertainty of $\nu$ measurement $\sigma_\nu$(see Methods). The error bar in each bin corresponds to the 1$\sigma$ Poisson error.  The vertical dashed lines in panels **a,c** represent the median value of the distribution and the horizontal bar indicates the error on the median, respectively. **Right**: relationships between measured parameters. **b**,  $R_{\rm e}$ versus Spergel index $\nu$. **d**, _q_ versus $R_{\rm e}$. **f**, _q_ versus $\nu$. **b,d,f**, data points are colour coded by _q_, $\nu$, and $R_{\rm e}$, respectively. The dashed lines in panels **b,e,f** mark the  $\nu=0$ threshold above which we classify galaxies as pure disks. **b,f**, the $\sersic$  indices listed on the top axis were converted using Eq. (\ref{eq:conversion}) (see Methods),  assuming $R_{\rm e}/\theta_{\rm b}=0.42$, where $\theta_{\rm b}$ is the beam size of the observations. This value is the median measured for the whole sample of galaxies. (*fig:histogram*)

**Figure 2. -** \small**Observed and 3$D$ intrinsic axis ratios for ALMA submm-bright galaxies.****Left**: distribution of observed axis ratio _q_.  **Right**: distribution of average intrinsic face-on axial ratio $B/A$ versus edge-on axial ratio $C/A$(scale-height), calculated as the first moment of the distribution of B/A and C/A, respectively. The sample distribution of $B/A$ is log-normal, while $C/A$ is Gaussian. **a,b**: the full sample. **c,d**: a subsample of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$-compact galaxies. **e,f**: a subsample of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$-extended galaxies. The red curves in left panels represent the MAP best-fit model with the highest posterior probability, which is identified as the step with highest posterior probability and nearest to the position defined by averages $\langle B/A \rangle$ and $\langle C/A \rangle$(the black squares in the right panels; see Methods). The error bar in each histogram bin corresponds to the 1$\sigma$ Poisson error. The dotted curve in panel **c** represents the expected distribution of projected axis ratios for galaxies with a spherical shape (C/A=1). The data points in right panels are colour coded by the posterior probability. Contours are plotted based on the density of the data points, using the posterior probability as weights. Contour levels are 1$\sigma$, 2$\sigma$, and 3$\sigma$. The black squares and error bars in the right panels represent the weighted mean and standard deviation derived from the histograms. We used the chi-square statistic to quantify the difference between the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of observational data and that of the best-fit model. The full sample and the two subsamples of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$-compact and -extended galaxies have $\chi^2 = $3.8, 5.8, and 9.2, respectively.

**Figure 14. -** \small**Merger history of submm galaxies using EAGLE cosmological simulation.****a**, Stellar mass and redshift distribution of the submm galaxy sample (orange symbols). **b**, SFR of the submm sample (shown in orange symbols) relative to the star-forming Main Sequence of the simulations  (blue solid line; all trends rescaled in star-formation to $z=1$, for clarity). Dark grey shaded regions mark the 16-84th percentiles of the relation, whereas light grey shaded regions indicate the 5-95th percentiles. Individual SFRs of the submm sample have been renormalized (see text). **c**, fraction of submm galaxies that underwent a major (blue symbols) or minor (grey symbols) mergers. The panel shows that major mergers do not seem to dominate the assembly of submm-bright galaxies. **d**, gas accretion rates of galaxies before they became submm bright. The accretion includes diffuse gas and minor and (rare) major mergers. Blue symbols indicate the median rates of a control sample, consisting of galaxies with stellar masses within $\pm 0.2$ dex of the median stellar mass of the submm galaxies. This panel indicates that the submm event was likely triggered by a high rate of gas inflow. **e**, Disc-to-Total (D/T) mass ratio of all galaxies at $z=0$. Orange symbols highlight the D/T ratio of the $z=0$ descendants of the submm galaxies. **f**, Similar to panel **e**, stellar [$\alpha$/Fe](represented by [O/Fe]) of all galaxies at $z=0$, as well as of the submm descendants. Panels **e** and **f** indicate that submm galaxies evolve into elliptical galaxies with typical [$\alpha$/Fe] element ratios. (*Eagle_data*)
