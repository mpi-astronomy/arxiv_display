**Abstract:** The gas surface density is one of the most relevant physical quantities in protoplanetary disks.However, ${ its precise measurement remains highly challenging due to the lack of a direct tracer.}$ In this study, we report the spatially-resolved detection of pressure-broadened line wings in the CO $J=3-2$ line in the RX J1604.3-2130 A transition disk as part of the exoALMA large program.Since pressure-broadened line wings are sensitive to the total gas ${ volume}$ density, we robustly constrain ${ the radial dependence of the gas surface density and midplane pressure in the region}$ located $50-110$ au from the central star, which encompasses the dust ring of the system.The peak radius of the midplane pressure profile matches the dust ring ${ radial}$ location, directly proving radial dust trapping at a gas pressure maximum. ${ The peak gas surface density is $18-44 {\rm g cm^{-2}}$}$ and decreases at radii interior to and exterior of the dust ring.A comparison of the gas and dust surface densities suggests that the disk turbulence is as low as $\alpha_{\rm turb} \sim 2\times10^{-4}$ . ${ Despite dust trapping}$ , the gas-to-dust surface density ratio at the ring peak is ${ $70-400$}$ , which implies already-formed protoplanets and/or less efficient dust trapping.The gas surface density drop at radii interior to the ring is consistent with a gas gap induced by a Jupiter-mass planet.The total gas mass within $50 < r < 110$ au is estimated to be $\sim 0.05-0.1 M_\odot$ ( $50-100 {M_{\rm Jup}}$ ), suggesting that planetary system formation is possible.

**Figure 16. -** (left) Azimuthally stacked CO spectra. The upper and lower panels show the same data, { but in the lower panel, we convolved the spectrum at each radius with a flat kernel of three channels and use the symmetric logarithm color map in order to enhance the faint emission in the line wings.} The horizontal dotted lines indicate the { radial range} of the dust ring. The dashed ellipse marks the { faint line wings we analyze in this Letter}. (middle) The best-fit model of the CO spectra. (right) The residual between the observed and model spectra.

The dust surface density is multiplied by 100 for visibility purposes. The black bar at the upper right corner indicates the spatial resolution of the CO image. (b) Midplane gas pressure profile (blue) with an arbitrarily scaled dust surface density profile (orange). The dust surface density peaks at the gas pressure maximum.
    Note that there are uncertainties from the undetermined $X_{\rm CO}$ in panels (a) and (b).
