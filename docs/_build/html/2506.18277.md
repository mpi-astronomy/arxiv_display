**Abstract:** Improving gamma-hadron separation is one of the most effective ways to enhance the performance of ground-based gamma-ray observatories. With over a decade of continuous operation, the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory has contributed significantly to high-energy astrophysics. To further leverage its rich dataset, we introduce a machine learning approach for gamma-hadron separation. A Multilayer Perceptron shows the best performance, surpassing traditional and other Machine Learning based methods. This approach shows a notable improvement in the detector's sensitivity, supported by results from both simulated and real HAWC data. In particular, it achieves a 19 \% increase in significance for the Crab Nebula, commonly used as a benchmark. These improvements highlight the potential of machine learning to significantly enhance the performance of HAWC and provide a valuable reference for ground-based observatories, such as Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) and the upcoming Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO).

**Figure 3. -** Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for MLP model performance across different fHit bins. Left panel (a): Results for on-array events. Right panel (b): Results for off-array events. Each curve corresponds to a specific fHit bin, labeled from B0 to B10. The MLP model exhibits progressively better classification performance with increasing fHit, as indicated by higher AUC values. (*fig:ROC_curve*)
