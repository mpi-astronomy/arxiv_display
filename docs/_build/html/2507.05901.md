**Abstract:** In the current panorama of large surveys, the vast amount of data obtained with different methods, data types, formats, and stellar samples, is making an efficient use of the available information difficult. The Survey of Surveys is a project to critically compile survey results in a single catalogue, facilitating the scientific use of the available information. In this second release, we present two new catalogs of stellar parameters (T $_{\rm{eff}}$ , log $g$ , and [ Fe/H ] ). To build the first catalog, SoS-Spectro, we calibrated internally and externally stellar parameters from five spectroscopic surveys (APOGEE, GALAH, Gaia-ESO, RAVE, and LAMOST). Our external calibration on the PASTEL database of high-resolution spectroscopy ensures better performances for metal-poor red giants. The second catalog, SoS-ML catalog, is obtained by using SoS-Spectro as a reference to train a multi-layer perceptron, which predicts stellar parameters based on two photometric surveys, SDSS and SkyMapper. As a novel approach, we build on previous parameters sets, from $* Gaia*$ DR3 and $* Andrae et al. (2023)*$ , aiming to improve their precision and accuracy. We obtain a catalog of stellar parameters for around 23 millions of stars, which we make publicly available. We validate our results with several comparisons with other machine learning catalogs, stellar clusters, and astroseismic samples. We find substantial improvements in the parameters estimates compared to other Machine Learning methods in terms of precision and accuracy, especially in the metal-poor range, as shown in particular when validating our results with globular clusters. We believe that there are two reasons behind our improved results at the low-metallicity end: first, our use of a reference catalog—the SoS-Spectro—which is calibrated using high-resolution spectroscopic data; and second, our choice to build on pre-existing parameter estimates from $* Gaia*$ and Andrae et al., rather than attempting to obtain our predictions from survey data alone.

**Figure 13. -** Kiel Diagram for the SM (above) and SDSS (below) full sample, colored with the estimated errors on the three parameters. From left to right: T$_{\rm{eff}}$, log $g$, and [Fe/H]. Hexagonal bins are colored based on the average of the errors inside the bin. The black line approximately encloses the region covered by the respective "train\_area" flags described in Sect.\ref{sec:cat}. (*KielA*)

**Figure 15. -** Comparison of the [Fe/H] predicted by this work and by three literature ML catalogs with the PASTEL (top row) and SAGA (bottom row) databases. Our results are shown in the leftmost plots, where the grey points show the results before, and the purple ones after, augmenting the reference SoS-Spectro catalog with very metal-poor stars. The median [Fe/H] differences for the before and after augmentation samples (computed only for [Fe/H] < –2) are indicated in the top-left corner of the first plot in each row. A similar comparison is presented for the following catalogs: \citet[][ blue, center-left panels]{andrae23}, \citet[][ red, center-right panels]{gu25}, and \citet[][ green, rightmost panels]{Zhang2023}.

**Figure 10. -** Comparison of atmospheric parameters predicted by our ML approach (abscissae) and literature ML catalogs (ordinates). The left plots show T$_{\rm{eff}}$ comparisons, the middle ones log $g$, and the right ones [Fe/H]. The top row shows the comparison with [Zhang, Green and Rix (2023)](), the middle row with [Gu, Fan and Zhao (2025)](), and the bottom row with [Andrae, Rix and Chandra (2023)](). The dashed line represents the 1:1 relationship. (*fig:litml*)
