**Abstract:** The discovery of the massive black hole (BH) system Gaia BH3 in pre-release _Gaia_ DR4 data suggests that wide BH binaries with luminous companions may be significantly overrepresented at low metallicities. Motivated by this finding, we have initiated a spectroscopic survey of low-metallicity stars exhibiting elevated \texttt{RUWE} values in $_ Gaia_$ DR3, using the FEROS and APF spectrographs. We identify promising BH binary candidates as objects with instantaneously measured radial velocities (RVs) that are very different from their mean RVs reported in _Gaia_ DR3. Thus far, we have observed over 500 targets, including a nearly complete sample of stars with $\rm[Fe/H] < -1.5$ , \texttt{RUWE} $> 2$ , and $G < 15$ . Our search has yielded one promising target exhibiting slow acceleration and an RV more than 98 km s $^{-1}$ different from its DR3 mean RV, as well as dozens of other candidates with smaller RV discrepancies. We quantify the sensitivity of our search using simulations, demonstrating that it recovers at least half of the BH companions within our selection criteria. We make all the spectra and RVs from our survey publicly available and encourage further follow-up.

**Figure 2. -** Dependence of predicted \texttt{RUWE} in DR3 on orbital period, distance, and BH mass for low-metallicity dwarf or giant companions to BHs, with the shaded regions representing a 68\% confidence interval. We randomly sample sky positions from our catalog of candidates, orbital eccentricities from a thermal distribution, and isotropic binary orientations. At orbital periods of $10^2$--$10^3$ d, \texttt{RUWE} increases as the projected semi-major axis of the photocenter increases, peaking at $\sim10^3$ days. At orbital periods $> 10^3$ d, the limited orbital coverage during _Gaia_ DR3's $\sim1000$ d observing baseline causes \texttt{RUWE} to decrease. \texttt{RUWE} also decreases as the binary gets farther away, since the projected semi-major axis of the photocenter decreases. \texttt{RUWE} is only weakly sensitive to BH mass. Due to their brighter absolute magnitudes, giants tend to have slightly larger \texttt{RUWE} values than dwarfs, and are detectable out to farther distances. With a selection cut of \texttt{RUWE}$> 2.0$, we are sensitive to orbital periods of $100$--$5000$ d and distances out to $\sim2$ kpc. (*fig:ruwe_trend_fig*)

**Figure 6. -** Comparison of our derived RVs to the mean RV reported in DR3. RVs for flagged spectra (see Section \ref{sec:problematic}) are plotted in orange. In most cases, the RVs are in good agreement. In several cases, the RVs are discrepant, suggesting the presence of a faint or dark companion. We highlight both Gaia BH3 and _Gaia_ DR3 6769569470180424704, which has the largest RV discrepancy in our sample. (*fig:compare_gaia_rvs*)

**Figure 1. -** Simulated _Gaia_ DR3 epoch astrometry and radial velocity curve for Gaia BH3 based on best-fit combined parameters from gaia_collaboration_discovery_2024. In the left panel, the gray line connects the barycenter to periastron. In the right panel, the temporal range of the simulated DR3 epoch astrometry is plotted with higher opacity. The epoch RVs of Gaia BH3 are different from its reported mean RV by at least 20 km s$^{-1}$ over $\sim70\%$ of its orbit (shaded purple region), suggesting that a search strategy based on this comparison may be useful in finding similar targets.
