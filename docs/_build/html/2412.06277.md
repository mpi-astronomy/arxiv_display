**Abstract:** As a key to chemical evolutionary studies, the distribution of elements in galactic provides a wealth of information to understand the individual star formation histories of galaxies.The r-process is a complex nucleosynthesis process, and the origin of r-process elements is heavily debated.Europium (Eu) is viewed as an almost pure r-process element.Accurate measurements of europium abundances in cool stars are essential for an enhanced understanding of the r-process mechanisms. We measure the abundance of Eu in solar spectra and a sample of metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo and metal-poor disk, with the metallicities ranging from $\GG{$-2.4$}$ to $-0.5$ dex, using non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) line formation. We compare these measurements with Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models to $\GG{explore the impact of the NLTE corrections on the contribution of r-process site in Galactic chemical evolution.}$ In this work, we use NLTE line formation, as well as one-dimensional (1D) hydrostatic and spatial averages of 3D hydrodynamical ( $<$ 3D $>$ ) model atmospheres to measure the abundance of Eu based on both the Eu II 4129 Å and Eu II 6645 Å lines for solar spectra and metal-poor stars. We find that $\GG{for Eu II 4129 Å line the NLTE modelling leads to higher (0.04 dex) solar Eu abundance in 1D and higher (0.07 dex) in \GG{$<$3D$>$} NLTE while}$ NLTE modelling leads to higher (0.01 dex) solar Eu abundance in 1D and lower (0.03 dex) in $\GG{$<$3D$>$}$ NLTE for Eu II 6645 Å line. $\GG{Although the NLTE corrections for the Eu II $\lambda$ 4129 Å and Eu II $\lambda$ 6645 Å lines are opposite, the discrepancy between the abundances derived from these individual lines reduces after applying NLTE corrections, highlighting the critical role of NLTE abundance determinations.}$ By comparing these measurements with Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models, we find that the $\G{amount of NLTE correction does not require significant change of the parameters for Eu production}$ in the GCE models.
