**Abstract:** Deep surveys have helped unveil the history of past and present galaxy mergers. In particular, they reveal their tidal debris and associated compact stellar systems. $\Euclid$ 's unique combination of capabilities (spatial resolution, depth, and wide sky coverage) will make it a groundbreaking tool for galactic archaeology in the local Universe, bringing low surface brightness (LSB) science into the era of large-scale astronomical surveys. $\Euclid$ 's Early Release Observations (ERO) demonstrate this potential with a field of view that includes several galaxies in the Dorado group. In this paper, we aim to derive from this image a mass assembly scenario for its main galaxies: NGC 1549, NGC 1553, and NGC 1546. We detect internal and external diffuse structures, and identify candidate globular clusters (GCs). By analysing the colours and distributions of the diffuse structures and candidate GCs, we can place constraints on the galaxies' mass assembly and merger histories. The results show that feature morphology, surface brightness, colours, and GC density profiles are consistent with galaxies that have undergone different merger scenarios. We classify NGC 1549 as a pure elliptical galaxy that has undergone a major merger. NGC 1553 appears to have recently transitioned from a late-type galaxy to early type, after a series of radial minor to intermediate mergers. NGC 1546 is a rare specimen of galaxy with an undisturbed disk and a prominent diffuse stellar halo, which we infer has been fed by minor mergers and then disturbed by the tidal effect from NGC 1553. Finally, we identify limitations specific to the observing conditions of this ERO, in particular stray light in the visible and persistence in the near-infrared bands. Once these issues are addressed and the extended emission from LSB objects is preserved by the data-processing pipeline, the Euclid Wide Survey will allow studies of the local Universe to be extended to statistical ensembles over a large part of the extragalactic sky.

**Figure 14. -** *Upper left*: features detected for each galaxy with the help of the $\IE$ images and residuals. *Upper right*: $\IE$ surface brightness map of the features. Those for which $\IE$ photometry can be performed are coloured according to their surface brightness and numbered. Those for which this study is not possible are delineated in black. The photometry of the shells, of the uncertain features between NGC 1549 and NGC 1553, and of the features close to the galactic centres was not estimated. These features are delineated in black. *Lower left*: $\IE-\JE$ integrated fluxes colour map. The features with uncertain detection in the NIR bands appear in grey.  *Lower right*: $\IE-\JE$ GCs colour map. The average colours are weighted based on the uncertainties of the magnitudes that contribute to them. The features that encompass less than three bright GC candidates appear in grey.

**Figure 12. -** Bright GC candidates density maps of the full ERO-D FoV (left column), with zooms on the NGC 1549-NGC 1553 pair (middle column) and on NGC 1546 (right column). The colour scale is the same for both zooms, where the density fields were re-evaluated locally using the samples within the cutouts. All GCs, blue GCs, and red GCs are respectively represented in the upper, middle and lower rows. The threshold used to differentiate between blue and red GCs is the median value of the $\IE-\HE$ GC candidate colours. (*GC_distribution*)

The interpolated metallicities and ages are obtained using the PEGASE \citep{2004A&A...425..881L} Single Stellar Population (SSP) model, however, the colour-coded area is consistent in age and metallicity across all other SSP models tested.
