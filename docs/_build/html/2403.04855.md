**Abstract:** Two protoplanets have recently been discovered within the PDS 70 protoplanetary $\new{disk}$ .    JWST/NIRCam offers a unique opportunity to characterize them and their birth environment at wavelengths difficult to access from the ground. We aim to image the circumstellar environment of PDS 70    at 1.87 $\upmu$ m and 4.83 $\upmu$ m, assess the presence of Pa- $\alpha$ emission due to accretion onto the protoplanets, and probe any IR excess indicative of heated circumplanetary material. We obtain non-coronagraphic JWST/NIRCam images of PDS 70 within the MINDS (MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey) program. We leverage the Vortex Image Processing (VIP) package for data reduction, and develop dedicated routines for optimal stellar PSF subtraction, unbiased imaging of the disk, and protoplanet flux measurement in this type of dataset.    A radiative transfer model of the disk is used to disentangle the    contributions from the disk and the protoplanets. We re-detect both protoplanets    and identify extended emission after subtracting a    disk model, including a large-scale spiral-like feature. We interpret its signal in the direct vicinity of planet $c$ as tracing the accretion stream feeding its circumplanetary disk, while the outer part of the feature may rather reflect asymmetric illumination    of the outer disk.    We also report a bright signal consistent with a previously proposed protoplanet candidate enshrouded in dust, near the 1:2:4 mean-motion resonance with planets $b$ and $c$ .    The 1.87 $\upmu$ m flux of planet $b$ is consistent with atmospheric model predictions,    but not that of planet $c$ . We discuss potential origins for this discrepancy, including    significant Pa- $\alpha$ line emission.    The 4.83 $\upmu$ m fluxes of planets $b$ and $c$ suggest    enshrouding dust or heated CO emission from their circumplanetary environment. The use of image-processing methods optimized for extended disk signals on high-sensitivity and high-stability JWST images can uniquely identify signatures of planet--disk interactions and enable accurate photometry of protoplanets at wavelengths difficultly probed from the ground. Our results point towards the prospect of identifying and characterizing more protoplanets in other JWST datasets.

**Figure 3. -** 
    NIRCam images of PDS 70 obtained in the F187N (top row) and F480M (bottom row) filters
    using our iterative PCA algorithm.
    The second and third columns show the images obtained after subtraction of our outer disk model,
    and further subtraction of protoplanets $b$ and c, respectively. Major and minor axes of the disk are indicated with solid and dashed lines, respectively, in the first column. Dashed circles indicate the predicted location for protoplanets $b$ and $c$ based on the orbital fits in \citet{Wang2021}, and for candidate $d$ based on the orbit suggested in \citetalias{Mesa2019a}. The astrometric measurements for $d$(blue dots) are compared to our new estimated astrometry (solid circle) in panel c.
    Units are MJy sr$^{-1}$.

**Figure 6. -** Images obtained at 1.87$\upmu$m (F187N; top row) and 4.80$\upmu$m (F480M; bottom row) with mean roll subtraction,
    TRAP, IROLL and IPCA. See text for details on each algorithm. The images correspond to the largest common field of view probed by the dithering pattern employed during the observation. The plate scale is 31 and 63 mas/pixel for the F187N and F480M images, respectively. A numerical mask with radius set to the FWHM of the PSF covers the inner part of the F187N images.

**Figure 4. -** Composite SED of PDS 70 $b$ showing literature spectro- and photometric measurements (grey and black error bars, respectively), the new NIRCam F187N and F480M photometry
(blue and red error bars, respectively), and
the best-fit atmospheric models found in \cite{Wang2021}. The model with the most support is shown with an orange solid line (extinct BT-SETTL model with extra blackbody emission). It is consistent with both of our measurements, and suggests the need for a circumplanetary contribution.
The light blue error bar is obtained
considering literature photometry for the star,
and illustrates the uncertainty associated to variability affecting $\new${some} other data points of the SED (details in Appendix \ref{sec:F187N_excess}).
