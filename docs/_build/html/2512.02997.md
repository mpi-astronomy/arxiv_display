**Abstract:** We present new MIRI F560W, F770W and F1000W imaging of the galaxy GN-z11 at a redshift of 10.603. We report a significant detection (14 $\sigma$ ) in the F560W and F770W images, and a marginal detection (3.2 $\sigma$ ) in the F1000W filter. The new MIRI observations cover the optical-red spectral range, and significantly extend previous NIRCam wavelength coverage from rest-frame 0.38 $\micron$ up to 0.86 $\micron$ . In this work, we analyse the spectral energy distribution (SED) combining this new MIRI imaging data with archival NIRSpec/Prism and MRS spectroscopy, and NIRCam imaging, i.e. covering the rest-frame 0.12 $\range$ 0.86 $\micron$ . New constraints such as the equivalent widths of the strong optical lines ( $\OIII{5008}$ , H $\beta$ and H $\alpha$ ) and the continuum emission at rest-frame 0.48 $\mu$ m, 0.66 $\mu$ m, and 0.86 $\mu$ m, free from emission line contributions, are presented. The continuum emission shows a flat energy distribution, in $f_\nu$ , up to 0.5 $\mu$ m, compatible with the presence of a mixed stellar population of young (4 $\pmm$ 1 Myr) and mature (63 $\pmm$ 23 Myr) stars that also account for the [ $\ion{O}{III}$ ] , $\Hb$ and $\Ha$ emission lines.The continuum at rest-frame 0.66 $\micron$ shows a 36 $\pmm$ 3 \% flux excess above the predicted flux for a mixed stellar population, pointing to the presence of an additional source contributing at these wavelengths. This excess increases to 91 $\pmm$ 28 \% at rest-frame 0.86 $\micron$ , although with a large uncertainty due to the marginal detection in the F1000W filter.We consider that hot dust emission in the dusty torus around a type 2 AGN could be responsible for the observed excess. Alternatively, this excess could be due to hot dust emission or to a photoluminiscence dust process (Extended Red Emission, ERE) under the extreme UV radiation field, as observed in some local metal-poor galaxies and in young compact starbursts. The presence of a type 1 AGN is not supported by the observed SED as the hot dust emission in luminous high- $\z$ QSOs contributes at wavelengths above rest-frame 1 $\micron$ , and an additional ad-hoc red source would be required to explain the observed flux excess at 0.66 and 0.86 $\micron$ . Additional deep MIRI imaging covering the rest-frame near-IR are needed to confirm the flux detection at 10 $\micron$ with higher significance, and to discriminate between the different hot dust emission in the extreme starburst and AGN scenarios with MIRI imaging at longer wavelengths.

**Figure 2. -** Continuum-only colour-colour diagrams. Black squares represent the GN-z11 colours based on the NIRCam and MIRI photometry after the subtraction of the emission lines contribution measured with NIRSpec and MRS ($\ie$ continuum-only colours) presented in Table \ref{tab:fluxes}. Continuum (dashed) lines display the continuum-only colours derived considering a stellar population colour-coded by their age assuming an instantaneous (continuum) SFH. These colours include the contribution from the stellar continuum calculated using the stellar models from BPASSv2.2 and its associated nebular continuum derived with Cloudy (see Sect. \ref{subsec:Cont-only}). Thin and thick lines represent the 0.05 and 0.2$\Zsun$ tracks, respectively. Orange, green and purple diamonds show the derived continuum-only colours from the composed $\z$$\simi$1 QSO (\citealt{Glikman+06,Selsing+16}, see Sect. \ref{subsec:SED_fitting}), the Seyfert 2 Mrk3 \citep{Spinelli+06} and a $\z$$\eqq$7.1 QSO \citep{Bosman2024,Bosman+25}. Red, blue and brown diamonds represent the values derived from a stacked spectra of $\simi$150 LRDs (\citealt{PerezGonzalez-LRD2024}, Pérez-González et al. in prep.), the COSMOS-Webb median-stacked LRD \citep{Akins+25} and the unique LRD known as 'The Cliff' \citep{deGraaff+25}, respectively. In the left and middle panels the brown diamond lie outside the colour range displayed. Black arrows in the lower right corners represent the vector magnitude for $A_\mathrm{V}$\eqq0.3 mag.

**Figure 3. -** NIRCam and MIRI photometry compared with different red SED objects. Grey squares and black circles represent the NIRCam+MIRI observed and continuum-only (see Sect. \ref{subsec:Cont.-results}) fluxes, respectively. Coloured lines represent the SEDs for different AGNs types and high-$\z$ objects with optical-red colours presented in Sect. \ref{subsec:Cont.-results}. Red line represents the stacked spectra for $\simi$150 local and high-$\z$ LRDs (\citealt{PerezGonzalez-LRD2024}, Pérez-González et al. in prep.). Brown line displays the spectra from the exotic $\z$$\simi$3.5 LRD `The Cliff' while brown diamonds represent its re-normalised fluxes from \citet{deGraaff+25} at rest- 0.9 and 1.9$\micron$. Blue line shows the COSMOS-Webb median-stacked LRD SED model presented in \citet{Akins+25}. Orange and purple lines show the $\z$$\simi$1 QSO composite spectrum, created by combining the UV+optical and near-IR spectral templates from \citet{Selsing+16} and \citet{Glikman+06}, and the NIRSpec+MRS spectrum for the $\z$$\eqq$7.1 QSO J1120+0641 (\citealt{Bosman2024,Bosman+25}), respectively. The HST/STIS spectrum for the Sy2 Mrk3 presented by \citet{Spinelli+06} is displayed as a green line. All observed spectra have been redshifted to $\z$$\eqq$10.6 and normalised at 4800Å.

**Figure 5. -** SED best-fit models considering the star formation and the different AGN scenarios. Top panel show the best-fit SEDs obtained with \texttt{CIGALE} assuming a type 1 and type 2 AGNs as blue and green lines, respectively. Red line displays the best-fit derived with \texttt{SYNTHESIZER-AGN} using a QSO template and an additional dusty torus. Black line and black circles represent the NIRSpec/Prism data presented in \citet{Bunker+23} and the NIRCam and MIRI photometry as derived in Sect. \ref{subsec:phot}, respectively. coloured squares show the modelled NIRCam and MIRI fluxes from the different best-fit models, while their residuals with the measured photometry are displayed below. Green, blue and red lines have been convolved to match the spectral resolution from NIRSpec/Prism ($\ie$ R=100). Middle panel shows the \texttt{CIGALE} best-fit models (in black) and the contributions of the nebular and stellar components (in blue) and the \citet{Fritz+06} torus emission (in brown). Dashed and continuos lines differentiate the results drawn from the SED fitting assuming a type 1 and type 2 AGN, respectively. Bottom panel displays the \texttt{SYNTHESIZER-AGN} best-fit (in black) along with the contributions of the nebular and stellar components (in blue), the QSO template (in magenta) and the dusty torus (in brown).
