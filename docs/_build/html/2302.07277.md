**Abstract:** Visual inspections of the first optical rest-frame images from JWST have indicated a surprisingly high fraction of disk galaxies at high redshifts. Here we alternatively apply self-supervised machine learning to explore the morphological diversity at$z \geq 3$. Our proposed data-driven representation scheme of galaxy morphologies, calibrated on mock images from the TNG50 simulation, is shown to be robust to noise and to correlate well with physical properties of the simulated galaxies, including their 3D structure. We apply the method simultaneously to F200W and F356W galaxy images of a mass-complete sample ($M_*/M_\odot>10^9$) at$z \geq 3$from the first JWST/NIRCam CEERS data release. We find that the simulated and observed galaxies do not populate the same manifold in the representation space from contrastive learning, partly because the observed galaxies tend to be more compact and more elongated than the simulated galaxies. We also find that about half the galaxies that were visually classified as disks based on their elongated images actually populate a similar region of the representation space than spheroids, which according to the TNG50 simulation is occupied by objects with low stellar specific angular momentum and non-oblate structure. This suggests that the disk fraction at$z > 3$as evaluated by visual classification may be severely overestimated by misclassifying compact, elongated galaxies as disks. Deeper imaging and/or spectroscopic follow-ups as well as comparisons with other simulations will help to unambiguously determine the true nature of these galaxies.

**Figure 13. -** Comparison of distributions of observed and simulated galaxies in the representation space. The top row shows the CEERS mass-complete sample and the bottom row the VISUAL sample with available visual morphologies. Top left-hand panel: UMAP visualization for the observed CEERS galaxy images selected in mass and redshift (color-coded by the source photo-$z$) overlapped with the representation of noise-added TNG50 galaxy images. Top middle panel: randomly chosen observed CEERS galaxy images in the UMAP visualization in the F200W filter. Top right-hand panel: randomly chosen observed CEERS galaxy images in the UMAP visualization in the F356W filter. Bottom left-hand panel: UMAP visualization for the observed VISUAL galaxy images selected in mass and redshift. Points are colored according to the visual classifications into several non-exclusive classes. Bottom middle panel: randomly chosen observed VISUAL galaxy images in the UMAP visualization in the F200W filter.

**Figure 9. -** Left-hand panel: UMAP visualization for all the TNG50 galaxy images in our dataset color-coded by the mean value of the distance in the UMAP representation between the noiseless and the reduced images of each galaxy (denoted as $\delta$). Right-hand panel: UMAP visualization for all the TNG50 galaxy images in our dataset color-coded by the mean value of the ratio of the flux measured in the TNG50 stamps and the flux derived from the noiseless TNG50 stamps for the F356W filter (denoted as $\delta_\mathrm{F356W}$). Large values of $\delta_\mathrm{F356W}$ indicate the presence of a secondary (or even more) source. The larger $\delta_\mathrm{F356W}$ is, the brighter the companions are with respect to the central galaxy. (*fig:umap_CEERS_BACK356*)

**Figure 12. -** UMAP visualization for all the TNG50 galaxy images in our dataset color-coded by the distribution of several morphological and photometric parameters. Color code corresponds to the median values in each hexagonal bin in the UMAP plane. From left to right and top to bottom, the different panels show: the logarithm of the effective radius ($r_e \mathrm{[kpc]}$), in kpc), the Sèrsic index ($n_e$), the ellipticity based on Sèrsic fit ($1-b/a$), the concentration ($C$), the asymmetry ($A$) and the smoothness ($C$). The scatter maps of these parameters are presented in \autoref{app:dependence}. (*fig:phot_hexbin_umap*)
