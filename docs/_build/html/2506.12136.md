**Abstract:** $\noindent$ We present 90 GHz continuum imaging of 119 star-forming regions in 30 nearby galaxies observed with MUSTANG-2 on the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope as part of the Star Formation in Radio Survey.The 90 GHz data were combined with 3, 15, and 33 GHz data taken previously by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to decompose radio spectra on $\approx$ 0.8 kpc scales into their synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust emission components.This was done using three scenarios:(i) a power law fit from 3 to 33 GHz,(ii) Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting from 3 to 90 GHz with a thermal dust component, and(iii) MCMC fitting from 3 to 33 GHz without a thermal dust component.For these cases, we find a median thermal (free-free) emission fraction at 33 GHz of (i) $88 \pm 2$ \% with a scatter of 17 \% , (ii) $76\pm 3$ \% with a scatter of 25 \% , and (iii) $84\pm 2$ \% with a scatter of 18 \% .From this we conclude that, on average, free-free, not thermal dust, remains the dominant emission component at 33 GHz. While scenario (ii) yields a thermal fraction that is $\approx$ 10 \% larger than scenario (iii), this difference decreases to $\approx$ 5 \% after AGN are removed. Consequently, star formation rates measured with thermal fractions at 33 GHz are only mildly biased high without 90 GHz data for the spectral decomposition.Furthermore, a power law fit of data from 3 to 33 GHz still provides a reliable estimate of the free-free emission at 33 GHz.

**Figure 6. -** Top panels: distributions of the thermal (free-free) fractions found using the four-parameter model that included 90 GHz data and thermal dust versus galactocentric radius and photometric aperture diameter. Bottom panels: distributions of the thermal fraction ratios for the four-parameter model versus the three-parameter model that excluded 90 GHz data and thermal dust versus galactocentric radius and photometric aperture diameter. We note low thermal fractions for two of the three regions associated with NGC 2146. Sample size: 118 regions (excluding the source likely associated with a supernova, NGC 6946 Enuc. 6a).

**Figure 1. -** Spectral index distributions for two-component power law fitting for 3 to 33 and 33 to 90 GHz. There are clear differences in the peaks and distribution widths; the distribution of the spectral indices measured from 3 to 33 GHz is narrower and peaks at $-0.028$, while the distribution of the spectral indices measured from 33 to 90 GHz is more extended and peaks at 0.06. This demonstrates the need for at least one additional power law component in order to adequately characterize the observed radio spectra. (*fig:spectralindexpowerlaw*)

**Figure 4. -** Images at each frequency for the extranuclear region NGC 5194 Enuc. 3. The white circles correspond to the apertures used to perform photometry, while the cyan circles represent the annuli used to determine the local background. A corresponding version of this figure for all other sources is available in the online journal as a figure set (120 images). (*fig:photometry*)
