**Abstract:** The bulk motion of the gas in protoplanetary disks around newborn stars is nearly Keplerian. By leveraging the high angular and spectral resolution of ALMA, we can detect small-scale velocity perturbations in molecular line observations caused by local gas pressure variations in the disk, possibly induced by embedded protoplanets.This paper presents the azimuthally averaged rotational velocity and its deviations from Keplerian rotation ( $\dvphi$ ) for the exoALMA sample, as measured in the $\twCOfull$ and $\thCOfull$ emission lines. The rotation signatures show evidence for vertically stratified disks, in which $\thCO$ rotates faster than $\twCO$ due to a distinct thermal gas pressure gradient at their emitting heights. We find $\dvphi$ -substructures in the sample on both small ( $\sim$ 10 au) and large ( $\sim$ 100 au) radial scales, reaching deviations up to 15 \% from background Keplerian velocity in the most extreme cases.More than 75 \% of the rings and 80 \% of the gaps in the dust continuum emission resolved in $\dvphi$ are co-located with gas pressure maxima and minima, respectively. Additionally, gas pressure substructures are observed far beyond the dust continuum emission. For the first time, we determined the gas pressure derivative at the midplane from observations and found it to align well with the dust substructures within the given uncertainties. Based on our findings, we conclude that gas pressure variations are likely the dominant mechanism for ring and gap formation in the dust continuum.

The pressure minimum and maximum locations are marked with vertical purple dashed and full lines, respectively. The circles in (b) mark the sign of the radial derivative of \dvphi  coinciding with the pressure minimum ($\oplus$) and maximum ($\ominus$), respectively. (*fig:vphi_press*)

The error bars show the standard deviation within each extracted radial annulus. The vertical dashed-dotted line indicates the radius that encompasses 95\% of the continuum emission, with the signs of the radial derivatives of \dvphi  marked at this location. The beam size is shown in the lower left corner. The \thCO\dvphi  radial profiles can be found in Fig. \ref{fig:dvphi_large_13co} of the Appendix. (*fig:dvphi_large*)

**Figure 7. -** Radial profiles of \dvphi  for \twCOfull   of all sources focused on the region of the continuum substructures, using the High Resolution Images. The profiles are plotted starting at two beam sizes from the disk center and the error bars show the standard deviation of each bin. The gray background gradient highlights the \texttt{frank} radial profiles of the dust continuum emission normalized to its peak. The locations of continuum rings, gaps, and crescents are plotted in solid, dashed, and dotted vertical gray lines, respectively \citep[][]{Curone_exoALMA}. We expect dust rings and gaps to be co-located with a radially decreasing and increasing \dvphi  profile, if caused by pressure maxima and minima, respectively. The beam size is plotted in the lower right corner. The \thCO\dvphi  radial profiles can be found in Fig. \ref{fig:dvphi_small_13co} of the Appendix. (*fig:dvphi_small*)
