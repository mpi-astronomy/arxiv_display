**Abstract:** The $\Euclid$ Q1 fields were selected for calibration purposes in cosmology and are therefore relatively devoid of nearby galaxies. However, this is precisely what makes them interesting fields in which to search for dwarf galaxies in local density environments. We take advantage of the unprecedented depth, spatial resolution, and field of view of the $\Euclid$ Quick Release (Q1) to build a census of dwarf galaxies in these regions. We have identified dwarf galaxies in a representative sample of 25 contiguous tiles in the Euclid Deep Field North (EDF-N), covering an area of 14.25 $\deg^2$ . The dwarf galaxy candidates were identified using a semi-automatic detection method, based on properties measured by the $\Euclid$ pipeline and released as part of the MER catalogue. A selection cut in surface brightness and magnitude was used to produce an initial dwarf candidate catalogue, followed by a cut in morphology (removing background spirals) and $\IE-\HE$ colour (removing red ellipticals). This catalogue was then visually classified to produce a final sample of dwarf candidates, including their morphology, number of nuclei, globular cluster (GC) richness, and presence of a blue compact centre. We identified 2674 dwarf candidates, corresponding to 188 dwarfs per square degree. The visual classification of the dwarfs reveals a slightly uneven morphological mix of 58 \% ellipticals and 42 \% irregulars, with very few potentially GC-rich (1.0 \% ) and nucleated (4.0 \% ) candidates but a noticeable fraction (6.9 \% ) of dwarfs with blue compact centres. The distance distribution of 388 (15 \% ) of the dwarf candidates with spectroscopic redshifts peaks at about 400 Mpc. Their stellar mass distribution confirms that our selection effectively identifies dwarfs while minimising contamination. The most prominent dwarf overdensities are dominated by dEs, while dIs are more evenly distributed across the field of view. This work highlights $\Euclid$ â€™s remarkable ability to detect and characterise dwarf galaxies across diverse masses, distances, and environments.

**Figure 10. -** _Left:_ Isodensity contour plot in average surface brightness versus apparent magnitude space for the visually identified dwarf galaxy candidates in the reference tile 102158889 with a score $\geq 0.8$. The dwarf candidate sample was manually cleaned to ensure good MER photometry of the sources. The upper portion of the outermost contour is used as basis for the subsequent automated selection cut (_right_). The non-dwarf galaxies (\texttt{POINT\_LIKE\_PROB}$< 0.8$"; grey points) and stars (\texttt{POINT\_LIKE\_PROB}$\geq 0.8$"; pink points) are also included for reference. _Right:_ An example of the automatic selection cut in the reference tile. We extended slightly the upper portion of the outer density contour (red) to select the few bright dwarf candidates with score $\geq 0.8$ that would otherwise have been missed. The final selection cut is shown in orange. Many of the less confident dwarfs (score $< 0.8$) are also selected by this line. (*fig:selection*)

**Figure 16. -** Distribution of the properties of the Q1 dwarf candidates with spectroscopic redshift (pale blue-violet) overlaid on the properties of all galaxies in the MER catalogue (pale brown) and the automatically selected dwarf candidates with spectroscopic redshift in all 25 Q1 tiles (dark grey). The absolute magnitudes of the \Euclid ERO Perseus dwarfs from \citet{EROPerseusDGs}, at a distance of 72 Mpc, are shown for comparison (dark red). The Perseus dwarfs are closer than the majority of the dwarf candidates in the Q1 data and therefore are detected to fainter absolute magnitudes. The physical sizes of the Q1 and Perseus dwarf candidates (dark red) cover a similar range, assuming that the Perseus dwarfs have a semimajor axis approximately equal to twice their effective radius ($2  \times R_{\rm e}$).

**Figure 18. -** Spatial distribution of the final dwarf candidates is shown alongside the HECATE galaxies within the 25 tiles (marked as open black circles with a transparent white fill) and dwarf galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts (pale blue-violet filled squares). The colour map is based on the number of dwarfs within bins of RA and Dec, with this count normalised to a value of 1. According to the colour bar, orange-yellow colours indicate regions with dwarf galaxy overdensities. HECATE host galaxies and dwarfs with spectroscopic redshifts are displayed in the left and right panels, representing distances, $D$, in the ranges of $90 \leq D/{\rm Mpc} < 150$ and $150 \leq D/{\rm Mpc} < 210$, respectively. The white star indicates the location of the Cat's eye nebula where a lack of dwarfs is expected. (*fig:soverdensities_with_zspecs*)
