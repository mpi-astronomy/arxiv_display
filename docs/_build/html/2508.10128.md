**Abstract:** We present polarization maps of dust emission at 340 GHz in the luminous high-mass protocluster, W3 IRS5, observed with the Submillimeter Array.The projected magnetic fields appear fairly organized with a pinched morphology in the northern part and a concave shape in the southern part.We fit the polarization maps with a two-component magnetic field model: an hourglass model centered at the continuum peak, SMM2, and an empirical sphere centered at the O-type star, IRS7.Using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we calculate a projected field strength of $B_\mathrm{pos} = 1.4 \; \mathrm{mG}$ .Along with the Zeeman measurement, a total magnetic field strength of $B_\mathrm{tot} = 1.6 \; \mathrm{mG}$ is obtained.We find that the gravitational energy is the most dominant, followed by magnetic energy, and then turbulent energy.Small values of the virial parameter, $\alpha_\mathrm{vir} = 0.8$ , and the ratio of timescales, $t_\mathrm{ff}/t_\mathrm{corss} = 0.6$ , suggest an ongoing collapse.We also show collimated molecular outflows in the $\mathrm{CO \; (3-2)}$ and $\mathrm{SiO \; (8-7)}$ transitions.The morphology of magnetic fields and the surrounding $\HII$ regions put forward a scenario for W3 IRS5.A gravitationally unstable dense core formed within a neutral gas ridge plowed by the expansions of W3 A and W3 B.The core began to contract, causing gravity to pull the magnetic field lines inward, which resulted in a pinched field morphology.Subsequent expansion of W3 F, ionized by IRS7, perturbed the magnetic field, creating concave patterns.The dynamical interactions among protostars led to misalignment of their outflows.

**Figure 1. -** (a) SMA 340 GHz continuum map (color scale and red contours) of W3 IRS5 overlaid on VLA $6 \; \mathrm{cm}$ continuum map \citep[gray contours; ][]{Tieftrunk1997} with labels of the nearby $\HI$I regions, W3 A, W3 B, and W3 F.
Red contours are plotted at $(-3,3,6,14,22,30,38,46,54,62) \times \sigma$, where $\sigma = 21 \; \mathrm{mJy   beam^{-1}}$ with a beam size of $2$\farcs$7 \times 2$\farcs$2$($\mathrm{P. A.} = 3^\circ$).
Blue crosses mark the positions of five compact continuum sources identified at $354 \; \mathrm{GHz}$ ([Wang, Bourke and Hogerheijde 2013]()) , where SMM2 coincides with the continuum peak, and SMM1 is located to the east.
Green open circles are the positions of near-infrared sources  ([Megeath, Wilson and Corbin 2005]()) , and green filled squares are the positions of compact radio sources at $22 \; \mathrm{GHz}$ and $43 \; \mathrm{GHz}$ ([Tuthill and Danchi 2005]()) .
The blue-filled star marks the position of the high-mass star, IRS7, powering the hypercompact $\HI$I region, W3 F, while another infrared source, IRS N7 (blue-open star), without any radio counterpart, is also shown  ([Bik, Henning and Stolte 2012]()) .
Several outflow axes (and a bipolar outflow along line of sight) reported in the literature are presented with labels of their associated tracers, including molecular outflows \citep[e.g.][]{Mitchell1991,Rodon2008,Wang2012}, water masers  ([Imai, Kameya and Sasao 2000]()) , and radio compact sources  ([Wilson, et. al 2003]()) .
The gray dashed contours outline the more extended $6 \; \mathrm{cm}$ radiation at $4 \; \mathrm{mJy   beam^{-1}}$ with $3^{\prime\prime}$ resolution.
(b) The SMA polarized intensity map (color scale) overlaid with the orientation of the projected magnetic field, $B_\mathrm{pos}$(line segment), which corresponds to dust polarization orientation rotated by $90^\circ$.
Line segments are sampled twice per synthesized beam in locations where $I > 3\sigma_I$ and $P > 3\sigma_P$(in black), and also $2\sigma_P < P < 3\sigma_P$(in purple).
The length of line segments is proportional to the fractional linear polarization in percentage, $P/I$, and the scalebar is shown in the upper right.
Three thick line segments in gray show the large-scale magnetic field orientation measured from single-dish polarimeters.
Red and blue arrows indicate bipolar outflows along with the outflow label.

The length of line segments is fixed and arbitrary.
