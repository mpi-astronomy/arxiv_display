|**Abstract**|            The instruments at the focus of the Euclid space observatory offer superb, diffraction-limited imaging over an unprecedented (from space) wide field of view of 0.57 deg$^2$. This exquisite image quality has the potential to produce high-precision astrometry for point sources once the undersampling of Euclid's cameras is taken into account by means of accurate, effective point spread function (ePSF) modelling. We present a complex, detailed workflow to simultaneously solve for the geometric distortion (GD) and model the undersampled ePSFs of the Euclid detectors. Our procedure was successfully developed and tested with data from the Early Release Observations (ERO) programme focused on the nearby globular cluster NGC 6397. Our final one-dimensional astrometric precision for a well-measured star just below saturation is 0.7 mas (0.007 pixel) for the Visible Instrument (VIS) and 3 mas (0.01 pixel) for the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP). Finally, we present a specific scientific application of this high-precision astrometry: the combination of Euclid and Gaia data to compute proper motions and study the internal kinematics of NGC 6397. Future work, when more data become available, will allow for a better characterisation of the ePSFs and GD corrections that are derived here, along with assessment of their temporal stability, and their dependencies on the spectral energy distribution of the sources as seen through the wide-band filters of Euclid.         |

|| <mark>N. Winkel</mark>, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. Jahnke</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            The origin of the tight scaling relation between the mass of supermassive black holes (SMBHs; $M_{\rm BH}$) and their host-galaxy properties remains unclear. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) probe phases of ongoing SMBH growth and offer the only opportunity to measure $M_{\rm BH}$ beyond the local Universe. However, determining AGN host galaxy stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_\star$, and their galaxy dynamical masses $M_{\rm dyn}$, is complicated by AGN contamination, aperture effects and different host galaxy morphologies. We select a sample of AGNs for which $M_{\rm BH}$ has been independently determined to high accuracy by state-of-the-art techniques: dynamical modeling of the reverberation signal and spatially resolving the broad-line region with VLTI/GRAVITY. Using IFU observations, we spatially map the host galaxy stellar kinematics across the galaxy and bulge effective radii. We find that that the dynamically hot component of galaxy disks correlates with $M_{\rm BH}$; however, the correlations are tightest for aperture-integrated $\sigma_\star$ measured across the bulge. Accounting for the different $M_{\rm BH}$ distributions, we demonstrate - for the first time - that AGNs follow the same $M_{\rm BH}$-$\sigma_\star$ and $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{\rm bulge, dyn}$ relations as quiescent galaxies. We confirm that the classical approach of determining the virial factor as sample-average, yielding ${\rm log }f= 0.65 \pm 0.18$, is consistent with the average $f$ from individual measurements. The similarity between the underlying scaling relations of AGNs and quiescent galaxies implies that the current AGN phase is too short to have altered BH masses on a population level. These results strengthen the local calibration of $f$ for measuring single-epoch $M_{\rm BH}$ in the distant Universe.         |

|| <mark>K. Jahnke</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-06*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted to Open Journal of Astrophysics; 10 pages, 5 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            We combine stellar mass functions and the recent first JWST-based galaxy-black hole scaling relations at $z=6$ to for the first time compute the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass volume density at this epoch, and compare this to the integrated SMBH mass growth from the population of UV-luminous quasars at $z>6$. We show that even under very conservative assumptions almost all growth of SMBH mass at $z>6$ does not take place in these UV-luminous quasars, but must occur in systems obscured through dust and/or with lower radiative efficiency than standard thin accretion disks. The `Soltan argument' is not fulfilled by the known population of bright quasars at $z>6$: the integrated SMBH mass growth inferred from these largely unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early Universe is by a factor $\ge$10 smaller than the total SMBH mass volume density at $z=6$. This is valid under a large range of assumption about luminosity, mass functions, and accretion modes, and is likely still a factor >2 smaller when accounting for known obscuration fractions at this epoch. The resulting consequences are: >90%, possibly substantially more, of SMBH-buildup in the early Universe does not take place in luminous unobscured quasar phases, but has to occur in obscured systems, with dust absorbing most of the emitted UV-visible AGN emission, potentially with accretion modes with super-Eddington specific accretion rates. This is consistent with short lifetimes for luminous quasar phases from quasar proximity zone studies and clustering. This would remove the empirical need for slow SMBH growth and hence exotic `high-mass seed' black holes at early cosmic time. It also predicts a large population of luminous but very obscured lower-mass quasars at $z>6$, possibly the JWST `Little Red Dots'. This finding might severe impact on how we will diagnose SMBH growth at $z=7$ to 15 in the future.         |

|| J. E. Andrews, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-06*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted to ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            We present a comprehensive multi-epoch photometric and spectroscopic study of SN 2024bch, a nearby (19.9 Mpc) Type II supernova (SN) with prominent early high ionization emission lines. Optical spectra from 2.9 days after the estimated explosion reveal narrow lines of H I, He II, C IV, and N IV that disappear by day 6. High cadence photometry from the ground and TESS show that the SN brightened quickly and reached a peak M$_V \sim$ $-$17.8 mag within a week of explosion, and late-time photometry suggests a $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.050 M$_{\odot}$. High-resolution spectra from day 8 and 43 trace the unshocked circumstellar medium (CSM) and indicate a wind velocity of 30--40 km s$^{-1}$, a value consistent with a red supergiant (RSG) progenitor. Comparisons between models and the early spectra suggest a pre-SN mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}\ M_\odot\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which is too high to be explained by quiescent mass loss from RSGs, but is consistent with some recent measurements of similar SNe. Persistent blueshifted H I and [O I] emission lines seen in the optical and NIR spectra could be produced by asymmetries in the SN ejecta, while the multi-component H$\alpha$ may indicate continued interaction with an asymmetric CSM well into the nebular phase. SN 2024bch provides another clue to the complex environments and mass-loss histories around massive stars.         |

|| <mark>R. Zhang</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-06*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            Context. Open clusters (OCs) are valuable probes of stellar population characteristics. Their age and metallicity provide insights into the chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way. By studying the metallicity of OCs, we can explore the spatial distribution of composition across the Galaxy and understand stellar birth radii through chemical tagging. However, inferring the original positions of OCs remains a challenge. Aims. This study investigates the distribution of metallicity in the solar neighborhood using data from Gaia DR3 and LAMOST spectra. By measuring accurate ages and metallicities, we aim to derive birth radii and understand stellar migration patterns. Methods. We selected 1131 OCs within 3 kpc of the Sun from Gaia DR3 and LAMOST DR8 low-resolution spectra (R=1800). To correct the LAMOST data, we incorporated high-resolution spectra from GALAH DR3 (R=28000) using an artificial neural network. The average metallicity of the OCs was derived from reliable [Fe/H] values of their members. We examined the metallicity distribution across the Galaxy and calculated birth radii based on age and metallicity. Results. The correction method reduces the systematic offset in LAMOST data. We found a metallicity gradient as a function of Galactocentric distance and guiding radii. Comparisons with chemo-dynamic simulations show that observed metallicity values are slightly lower than predicted when uncertainties are ignored, but the metallicity gradients align with previous studies. We also inferred that many OCs near the Sun likely originated from the outer Galactic disk.         |

|| J.-G. Zhang, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-06*|
|*Comments*| *18 pages, 7 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            The Macquart relation and time-delay cosmography are now two promising ways to fast radio burst (FRB) cosmology. In this work, we propose a joint method that combines strongly lensed and unlensed FRBs for improving cosmological parameter estimation by using simulated FRB data from the future sensitive coherent all-sky monitor survey, which is expected to detect a large number of FRBs including galaxy-galaxy strongly lensed events. We find that using a detectable sample of 100,000 localized FRBs including $40$ lensed events can simultaneously constrain the Hubble constant and the equation of state of dark energy, with high precision of $\varepsilon(H_0)=0.4\%$ and $\varepsilon(w)=4.5\%$ in the simplest dynamical dark energy model. The joint analysis of unlensed and lensed FRBs significantly improves the constraint on $H_0$, which could be more effective than combining either the unlensed FRBs with future gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens or the lensed FRBs with CMB. Furthermore, combining the full FRB sample with the CMB+BAO+SNe data yields $\sigma(H_0)=0.29~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, $\sigma(w_0)=0.046$, and $\sigma(w_a)=0.15$ in the two-parameter dynamical dark energy model, which outperform the results from the CMB+BAO+SNe+GW data. This reinforces the cosmological implications of a multi-wavelength observational strategy in optical and radio bands. We conclude that the future FRB observations will shed light on the nature of dark energy and also the Hubble tension if enough events with long-duration lensing are incorporated.         |
