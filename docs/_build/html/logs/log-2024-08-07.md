|**Abstract**|            We study, from both a theoretical and observational perspective, the physical origin and spectroscopic impact of extreme nebular emission in high-redshift galaxies. The nebular continuum, which can appear during extreme starbursts, is of particular importance as it tends to redden UV slopes and has a significant contribution to the UV luminosities of galaxies. Furthermore, its shape can be used to infer the gas density and temperature of the ISM. First, we provide a theoretical background, showing how different stellar populations (SPS models, IMFs, and stellar temperatures) and nebular conditions impact observed galaxy spectra. We demonstrate that, for systems with strong nebular continuum emission, 1) UV fluxes can increase by up to 0.7~magnitudes (or more in the case of hot/massive stars) above the stellar continuum, which may help reconcile the surprising abundance of bright high-redshift galaxies and the elevated UV luminosity density at $z>10$, 2) at high gas densities, UV slopes can redden from $\beta\lesssim-2.5$ to $\beta\sim-1$, 3) observational measurements of $\xi_{ion}$ are grossly underestimated, and 4) UV downturns from two-photon emission can masquerade as DLAs. Second, we present a dataset of 58 galaxies observed with NIRSpec on JWST at $2.5<z<9.0$ that are selected to have strong nebular continuum emission via the detection of the Balmer jump. Five of the 58 spectra are consistent with being dominated by nebular emission, exhibiting both a Balmer jump and a UV downturn consistent with two-photon emission. For some galaxies, this may imply the presence of hot massive stars and a top-heavy IMF. We conclude by exploring the properties of spectroscopically confirmed $z>10$ galaxies, finding that UV slopes and UV downturns are in some cases redder or steeper than expected from SPS models, which may hint at more exotic (e.g. hotter/more massive stars or AGN) ionizing sources.         |

|**Abstract**|            One of the more surprising findings after the first year of JWST observations is the large number of spatially extended galaxies (ultra-red flattened objects, or UFOs) among the optically-faint galaxy population otherwise thought to be compact. Leveraging the depth and survey area of the JADES survey, we extend observations of the optically-faint galaxy population to an additional 112 objects, 56 of which are well-resolved in F444W with effective sizes, $R_e > 0.25''$, more than tripling previous UFO counts. These galaxies have redshifts around $2 < z < 4$, high stellar masses ($\mathrm{log(M_*/M_{\odot})} \sim 10-11$), and star-formation rates around $\sim 100-1000 \mathrm{M_{\odot}/yr}$. Surprisingly, UFOs are red across their entire extents which spatially resolved analysis of their stellar populations shows is due to large values of dust attenuation (typically $A_V > 2$ mag even at large radii). Morphologically, the majority of our UFO sample tends to have low SÃ©rsic indices ($n \sim 1$) suggesting these large, massive, optically faint galaxies have little contribution from a bulge in F444W. Further, a majority have axis-ratios between $0.2 < q < 0.4$, which Bayesian modeling suggests that their intrinsic shapes are consistent with being a mixture of inclined disks and prolate objects with little to no contribution from spheroids. While kinematic constraints will be needed to determine the true intrinsic shapes of UFOs, it is clear that an unexpected population of large, disky or prolate objects contributes significantly to the population of optically faint galaxies.         |

|**Abstract**|            When the solar wind interacts with the ionosphere of an unmagnetized planet, it induces currents that form an induced magnetosphere. These currents and their associated magnetic fields play a pivotal role in controlling the movement of charged particles, which is essential for understanding the escape of planetary ions. Unlike the well-documented magnetospheric current systems, the ionospheric current systems on unmagnetized planets remain less understood, which constrains the quantification of electrodynamic energy transfer from stars to these planets. Here, utilizing eight years of data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission, we investigate the global distribution of ionospheric currents on Mars. We have identified two distinct current systems in the ionosphere: one aligns with the solar wind electric field yet exhibits hemispheric asymmetry perpendicular to the electric field direction; the other corresponds to the flow pattern of annually-averaged neutral winds. We propose that these two current systems are driven by the solar wind and atmospheric neutral winds, respectively. Our findings reveal that Martian ionospheric dynamics are influenced by the neutral winds from below and the solar wind from above, highlighting the complex and intriguing nature of current systems on unmagnetized planets.         |
