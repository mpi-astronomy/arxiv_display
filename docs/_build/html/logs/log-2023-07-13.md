|**Abstract**| The combined study of the flaring of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at radio wavelengths and pc-scale jet kinematics with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) has led to the view that i) the observed flares are associated with ejections of synchrotron blobs from the core, and ii) most of the flaring would follow a one-to-one correlation with the component ejection. Recent results have provided mounting evidence that the quasi-regular component injections into the relativistic jet may not be the only cause of the flux variability. We propose that AGN flux variability and jet morphology changes can both be of deterministic nature, i.e. having a geometric/kinetic origin linked to the time-variable Doppler beaming of the jet emission as its direction changes due to precession (and nutation). The physics of the underlying jet leads to shocks, instabilities, or to ejections of plasmoids. The appearance (morphology, flux, etc.) of the jet can, however, be strongly affected and modulated by precession. We demonstrate this modulating power of precession for OJ 287. For the first time, we show that the spectral state of the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) can be directly related to the jet's precession phase. We model the SED evolution and reproduce the precession parameters. Further, we apply our precession model to eleven prominent AGN. We show that for OJ 287 precession seems to dominate the long-term variability ($\gtrsim 1\,{\rm yr}$) of the AGN flux, SED spectral state, and jet morphology, while stochastic processes affect the variability on short timescales ($\lesssim 0.2\,{\rm yr}$). |

|**Abstract**| 55 Cnc e is an ultra-short period super-Earth transiting a Sun-like star. Past observations in the optical range detected a time-variable flux modulation phased with the planetary orbital period whose amplitude is too large to be explained by reflected light and thermal emission alone. The goal of the study is to investigate the origin of the variability and timescale of 55 Cnc e's phase curve modulation. To that end, we used the CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS) whose exquisite photometric precision provides an opportunity to characterise minute changes in the phase curve from orbit to orbit. CHEOPS observed 29 individual visits of 55 Cnc e between March 2020 and February 2022. Based on these observations, we investigate the different processes that could be at the origin of the observed modulation. In particular, we build a toy model to assess whether a circumstellar torus of dust driven by radiation pressure and gravity could match the observed flux variability timescale. We find that 55 Cnc e's phase curve amplitude and peak offset do vary between visits. The sublimation timescales of selected dust species reveal that silicates expected in an Earth-like mantle would not survive long enough to explain the observed phase curve modulation. We find that silicon carbide, quartz and graphite are plausible candidates for the circumstellar torus composition due to their long sublimation timescales. The extensive CHEOPS observations confirm that the phase curve amplitude and offset vary in time. We find that dust could provide the grey opacity source required to match the observations. However, the data at hand do not provide evidence that circumstellar material with variable grain mass per unit area is actually causing the observed variability. Future observations with JWST promise exciting insights on this iconic super-Earth. |
