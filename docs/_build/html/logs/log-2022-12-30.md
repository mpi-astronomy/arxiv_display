|**Abstract**| Cluster cosmology depends critically on how the optical clusters are selected from imaging surveys. We compare the conditional luminosity function (CLF) and weak lensing halo masses between two different cluster samples at fixed richness, detected within the same volume ($0.1{<}z{<}0.34$) using the red-sequence and halo-based methods. After calibrating our CLF deprojection method against mock galaxy samples, we measure the 3D CLFs by cross-correlating clusters with SDSS photometric galaxies. As expected, the CLFs of the red-sequence and halo-based finders exhibit redder and bluer populations, respectively. We also find significant shape discrepancies between the two CLFs at the faint end, where the red-sequence clusters show a strong deficit of faint galaxies but a bump at $M_r{\sim}-20.5$, while the halo-based clusters host an increasing number of blue satellites. By comparing the subsamples of clusters that have a match between the two catalogues to those without matches, we discover that the CLF shape depends sensitively on the cluster centroiding. However, the average weak lensing halo mass between the matched and non-matched clusters are roughly consistent with each other in either cluster sample. Since the colour preferences of the two cluster finders are almost orthogonal, such a consistency indicates that the scatter in the mass-richness relation of either cluster sample is close to random. Therefore, while the choice of how optical clusters are identified impacts the satellite content, our result suggests that it should not introduce strong systematics biases in cluster cosmology. |

|**Abstract**| The $\alpha$-attractor models are some of the most interesting models of inflation from the point of view of upcoming observations in cosmology and are also attractive from the point of view of supergravity. We confront representative models of exponential and polynomial $\alpha$-attractors with the latest cosmological data (Planck' 18+BICEP2/Keck array) to obtain predictions and best-fit values of model parameters. The analysis is done by making use of ModeChord and CosmoMC plugged together via PolyChord. |

|**Abstract**| LAMOST-MRS-B is one of the sub-surveys of LAMOST medium-resolution (R~7500) spectroscopic survey. It aims at studying the statistical properties (e.g., binary fraction, orbital period distribution, mass ratio distribution) of binary stars and exotic stars. We intend to observe about 30000 stars (10 mag <= G <= 14.5 mag) with at least 10 visits in five years. We first planned to observe 25 plates around the galactic plane in 2018. Then the plates were reduced to 12 in 2019 because of the limitation of observation. At the same time, two new plates located at the high galactic latitude were added to explore binary properties influenced by the different environments. In this survey project, we set the identified exotic and low-metallicity stars with the highest observation priorities. For the rest of the selected stars, we gave higher priority to the relatively brighter stars in order to obtain high-quality spectra as many as possible. Spectra of 49129 stars have been obtained in LAMOST-MRS-B field and released in DR8, of which 28828 and 3375 stars have been visited more than twice and ten times with SNR >= 10, respectively. Most of the sources are B-, A-, and F-type stars with 0.6 < [Fe/H] < 0.4 dex. We also obtain 347 identified variable and exotic stars and about 250 stars with [Fe/H] < 1 dex. We measure radial velocities (RVs) by using 892233 spectra of the stars. The uncertainties of RV achieve about 1 km/s and 10 km/s1 for 95% of late- and early-type stars, respectively. The datasets presented in this paper are available at 0113.00035.">this http URL |

|**Abstract**| Fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be used to measure the Hubble constant by employing the Macquart relation. However, at present, only a small number of FRB events are localized to their host galaxies with known redshifts. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian method to statistically measure the Hubble constant using unlocalized FRBs and galaxy catalog data, which makes it possible to constrain cosmological parameters by using a large number of FRB data without known redshift information. Using the six FRB events observed by ASKAP combined with the big bang nucleosynthesis result, we obtain $H_0=71.7^{+8.8}_{-7.4}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the simulation-based case and $H_0=71.5^{+10.0}_{-8.1}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the observation-based case ($68\%$ highest-density interval), assuming different host galaxy population parameters. We also estimate that in the next few years, using thousands of FRBs could achieve a $3\%$ precision on the random error of the Hubble constant. |

|**Abstract**| Adaptive optics (AO) is a technique allowing to drastically improve ground-based telescopes angular resolution. The wavefront sensor (WFS) is one of the key components of such systems, driving the fundamental performance limitations. In this paper, we focus on a specific class of WFS: the Fourier-filtering wavefront sensors (FFWFS). This class is known for its extremely high sensitivity. However, a clear and comprehensive noise propagation model for any kind of FFWFS is lacking. Considering read-out noise and photon noise, we derive a simple and comprehensive model allowing to understand how these noises propagates in the phase reconstruction in the linear framework. This new noise propagation model works for any kind of FFWFS, and allows to revisit the fundamental sensitivity limit of these sensors. Furthermore, a new comparison between widely used FFWFS is held. We focus on the two main used FFWFS classes: the Zernike WFS (ZWFS) and the pyramid WFS (PWFS), bringing new understanding of their behavior. |

|**Abstract**| We perform a Bayesian study of a generalization of the basic $\alpha$-attractor T model given by the potential $V(\phi)=V_0\left[1-\text{sech}^{p}\left(\phi/\sqrt{6\alpha}M_{pl}\right)\right]$ where $\phi$ is the inflaton field and the parameter $\alpha$ corresponds to the inverse curvature of the scalar manifold in the conformal or superconformal realizations of the attractor models. Such generalization is characterized by the power $p$ which includes the basic or base model for $p=2$. Once the priors for the parameters of the $\alpha$-attractor potential are set by numerical exploration, we perform the corresponding statistical analysis for the cases $p=1\, , 2\, , 3\, ,4$, and derive posteriors. Considering the original $\alpha$-attractor potential as the base model, we calculate the evidence for our generalization, and conclude that the $p=4$ model is preferred by the CMB data. We also present constraints for the parameter $\alpha$. Interestingly, all the cases studied prefer a specific value for the tensor-to-scalar ratio given by $r\simeq 0.0025$. |

|**Abstract**| Disk winds and jets are ubiquitous in active galactic nuclei (AGN), and how these two components interact remains an open question. We study the radio properties of a radio-intermediate quasar III Zw 2. We detect two jet knots J1 and J2 on parsec scales, which move at a mildly apparent superluminal speed of $1.35\,c$. Two $\gamma$-ray flares were detected in III Zw 2 in 2009--2010, corresponding to the primary radio flare in late 2009 and the secondary radio flare in early 2010. The primary 2009 flare was found to be associated with the ejection of J2. The secondary 2010 flare occurred at a distance of $\sim$0.3 parsec from the central engine, probably resulting from the collision of the jet with the accretion disk wind. The variability characteristics of III Zw 2 (periodic radio flares, unstable periodicity, multiple quasi-periodic signals and possible harmonic relations between them) can be explained by the global instabilities of the accretion disk. These instabilities originating from the outer part of the warped disk propagate inwards and can lead to modulation of the accretion rate and consequent jet ejection. At the same time, the wobbling of the outer disk may also lead to oscillations of the boundary between the disk wind and the jet tunnel, resulting in changes in the jet-wind collision site. III Zw 2 is one of the few cases observed with jet-wind interactions, and the study in this paper is of general interest for gaining insight into the dynamic processes in the nuclear regions of AGN. |

|**Abstract**| The Evanescent Wave Coronagraph (EvWaCo) is an achromatic coronagraph mask with adjustable size over the spectral domain [600nm, 900nm] that will be installed at the Thai National Observatory. We present in this work the development of a bench to characterise its Extreme Adaptive Optics system (XAO) comprising a DM192 ALPAO deformable mirror (DM) and a 15x15 Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SH-WFS). In this bench, the turbulence is simulated using a rotating phase plate in a pupil plane. In general, such components are designed using a randomly generated phase screen. Such single realisation does not necessarily provide the wanted structure function. We present a solution to design the printed pattern to ensure that the beam sees a strict and controlled Kolmogorov statistics with the correct 2D structure function. This is essential to control the experimental conditions in order to compare the bench results with the numerical simulations and predictions. This bench is further used to deeply characterise the full 27 mm pupil of the ALPAO DM using a 54x54 ALPAO SH-WFS. We measure the average shape of its influence functions as well as the influence function of each single actuator to study their dispersion. We study the linearity of the actuator amplitude with the command as well as the linearity of the influence function profile. We also study the actuator offsets as well as the membrane shape at 0-command. This knowledge is critical to get a forward model of the DM for the XAO control loop. |

|| <mark>Joshua Ziegler</mark>, Katherine Freese |
|*Appeared on*| *2022-12-29*|
|*Comments*| *34 pages, 7 figures*|
|**Abstract**| Standard stellar evolution models predict that black holes in the range of approximately $50 - 140 M_\odot$ should not exist directly from stellar evolution. This gap appears because stars with masses between 100 and 240 $M_\odot$ are expected to undergo a pair instability supernova and leave behind no remnant, or a pulsational pair instability supernova and leave behind a remnant much smaller than their initial stellar mass. However, black holes have been discovered by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration within this mass range. In previous work (arXiv:2010.00254), we used the stellar evolution code MESA to show that the addition of non-nuclear energy (such as from annihilation of dark matter) could alter the evolution of a 180 $M_\odot$ star so that the observed black holes could be produced from isolated stars. In this paper, we extend this analysis to stars of other masses, and find that sufficient amounts of non-nuclear energy can allow any star to avoid pair instability, and could produce a black hole of mass comparable to the initial stellar mass. In addition, we produce examples of the type of black hole initial mass function that can be produced from this mechanism. These illustrative examples suggest that adding non-nuclear energy to stars offers a way to fully close the mass gap. |

|*Comments*| *10 pages, double column, 0 figures*|
|**Abstract**| Next generation of cosmological observations are expected to improve the measurements of several quantities connected to the primordial inflation in the early Universe. These quantities include for example improved measurements for the spectral index of the scalar curvature of the primordial power spectrum and to also bring a better understanding on the scaling dependence of the primordial spectrum. This includes the running of the tilt and, possibly, also the running of the running. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of generating large runnings in the context of warm inflation. Useful analytical expressions for the runnings are derived in the context of warm inflation in the strong dissipation regime. The results are compared to and discussed for some well motivated primordial inflaton potentials that have recently been of interest in the literature. |

|**Abstract**| In the Earth's magnetosphere, there are fewer than a dozen dedicated probes beyond low-Earth orbit making in-situ observations at any given time. As a result, we poorly understand its global structure and evolution, the mechanisms of its main activity processes, magnetic storms, and substorms. New Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods, including machine learning, data mining, and data assimilation, as well as new AI-enabled missions will need to be developed to meet this Sparse Data challenge. |
