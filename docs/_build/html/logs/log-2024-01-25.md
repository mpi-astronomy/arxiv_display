|**Abstract**| Context. Abundances of s- and r-process elements in Sun-like stars constrain nucleosynthesis in extreme astrophysical events, such as compact binary mergers and explosions of highly magnetised rapidly rotating massive stars. Aims. We measure solar abundances of yttrium (Y) and europium (Eu) using 3D non-local thermal equilibrium (NLTE) models. We use the model to determine the abundance of Y, and also explore the model's ability to reproduce the solar centre-to-limb variation of its lines. In addition, we determine the Eu abundance using solar disc-centre and integrated flux spectra. Methods. We developed an NLTE model of Eu and updated our model of Y with collisional data from detailed quantum-mechanical calculations. We used the IAG spatially resolved high-resolution solar spectra to derive the solar abundances of Y across the solar disc and of Eu for integrated flux and at disc centre using a set of carefully selected lines and a 3D radiation-hydrodynamics model of the solar atmosphere. Results. We find 3D NLTE solar abundances of A(Y)$_{\textrm{3D NLTE}}$=$2.30 \pm 0.03_{\textrm{stat}} \pm 0.07_{\textrm{syst}}$ dex based on observations at all angles and A(Eu)$_{\textrm{3D NLTE}}$=$0.57 \pm 0.01_{\textrm{stat}} \pm 0.06_{\textrm{syst}}$ dex based on the integrated flux and disc-centre intensity. 3D NLTE modelling offers the most consistent abundances across the solar disc, and resolves the problem of severe systematic bias in Y and Eu abundances inherent to 1D LTE, 1D NLTE, and 3D LTE modelling. |

|**Abstract**| The XLF of AGN offers a robust tool to study the evolution and the growth of SMBHs over cosmic time. Owing to the limited area probed by X-ray surveys, optical surveys are routinely used to probe the accretion in the high redshift Universe $z\geq 3$. However, optical surveys may be incomplete because they are strongly affected by dust redenning. In this work, we derive the XLF and its evolution at high redshifts using a large sample of AGNs selected in different fields with various areas and depths covering a wide range of luminosities. Additionally, we put the tightest yet constraints on the absorption function in this redshift regime. In particular, we use more than 600 soft X-ray selected high-z sources in the Chandra Deep fields, the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey and the XMM-XXL northern field. We derive the X-ray spectral properties for all sources via spectral fitting, using a consistent technique and model. For modeling the parametric form of the XLF and the absorption function, we use a Bayesian methodology allowing us to correctly propagate the uncertainties for the observed X-ray properties of our sources and also the absorption effects. The evolution of XLF is in agreement with a pure density evolution model similar to what is witnessed at optical wavelengths, although a luminosity dependent density evolution model cannot be securely ruled out. A large fraction ($60\%)$ of our sources are absorbed by column densities of $\rm N_H \geq 10^{23} cm^{-2} $, while $17$\% of the sources are CTK. Our results favor a scenario where both the ISM of the host and the AGN torus contribute to the obscuration. The derived BHAD is in agreement with the simulations, if one takes into account that the X-ray AGN are hosted by massive galaxies, while it differs from the one derived using JWST data. The latter could be due to the differences in the AGN and host-galaxy properties. |

|**Abstract**| Hot Jupiters are among the best-studied exoplanets, but it is still poorly understood how their chemical composition and cloud properties vary with longitude. Theoretical models predict that clouds may condense on the nightside and that molecular abundances can be driven out of equilibrium by zonal winds. Here we report a phase-resolved emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b measured from 5-12 $\mu$m with JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). The spectra reveal a large day-night temperature contrast (with average brightness temperatures of 1524$\pm$35 and 863$\pm$23 Kelvin, respectively) and evidence for water absorption at all orbital phases. Comparisons with three-dimensional atmospheric models show that both the phase curve shape and emission spectra strongly suggest the presence of nightside clouds which become optically thick to thermal emission at pressures greater than ~100 mbar. The dayside is consistent with a cloudless atmosphere above the mid-infrared photosphere. Contrary to expectations from equilibrium chemistry but consistent with disequilibrium kinetics models, methane is not detected on the nightside (2$\sigma$ upper limit of 1-6 parts per million, depending on model assumptions). |

|**Abstract**| The upcoming Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) slitless spectroscopic survey poses a challenge of flux calibration, which requires a large number of flux-standard stars. In this work, we design an uncertainty-aware residual attention network, the UaRA-net, to derive the CSST SEDs with a resolution of R = 200 over the wavelength range of 2500-10000 \AA using LAMOST normalized spectra with a resolution of R = 2000 over the wavelength range of 4000-7000 \AA. With the special structure and training strategy, the proposed model can not only provide accurate predictions of SEDs but also their corresponding errors. The precision of the predicted SEDs depends on effective temperature (Teff), wavelength, and the LAMOST spectral signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), particularly in the GU band. For stars with Teff = 6000 K, the typical SED precisions in the GU band are 4.2%, 2.1%, and 1.5% at SNR values of 20, 40, and 80, respectively. As Teff increases to 8000 K, the precision increases to 1.2%, 0.6%, and 0.5%, respectively. The precision is higher at redder wavelengths. In the GI band, the typical SED precisions for stars with Teff = 6000 K increase to 0.3%, 0.1%, and 0.1% at SNR values of 20, 40, and 80, respectively. We further verify our model using the empirical spectra of the MILES and find good performance. The proposed method will open up new possibilities for optimal utilization of slitless spectra of the CSST and other surveys. |

|**Abstract**| Based on 2-minute cadence TESS data, we investigate pulsations of TIC 65138566 and TIC 139729335 and discover them to be two new HADS stars with equally spaced g modes. We recognize the radial fundamental mode $f_1$ = 18.3334 c/d and the first overtone $f_3$ = 23.6429 c/d for TIC 65138566, and identify the highest peak $f_1$ = 19.0955 c/d as the radial fundamental mode for TIC 139729335. For g modes, both stars display a regular period spacing of 2413 s. Through detailed seismological analysis, we deduce that these period spacing patterns correspond to modes with $\ell$ = 1. Moreover, our analysis reveals that with the increase in masses and metallicities, the star should display a higher degree of evolution to match a specific period spacing $\Pi_0$. Conversely, the star should have a lower extent of evolution to match the radial fundamental mode. These two contradictory behaviors allow us to precisely obtain stellar physical parameters. TIC 65138566 and TIC 139729335 are determined to be two main sequence stars that have almost the same range of masses and metallicities, with $M$ = 1.36 $\pm$ 0.06 $M_{\odot}$ and $Z$ = 0.005 $\pm$ 0.002. The hydrogen abundance in the core of TIC 65138566 is estimated to be about 0.28, while TIC 139729335 has a slightly higher value of around 0.31. Finally, we suggest that the HADS $\delta$ Scuti-$\gamma$ Doradus star TIC 308396022 is a main sequence star with $M$ = 1.54 $\pm$ 0.08 $M_{\odot}$, $Z$ = 0.007 $\pm$ 0.001, and $X_{\rm c}$ = 0.18 $\pm$ 0.02. |
