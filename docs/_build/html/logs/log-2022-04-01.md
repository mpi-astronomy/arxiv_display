|**Abstract**| The high-magnification microlensing event KMT-2021-BLG-1077 exhibits a subtle and complex anomaly pattern in the region around the peak. We analyze the lensing light curve of the event with the aim of revealing the nature of the anomaly. We test various models in combination with several interpretations. We find that the anomaly cannot be explained by the usual three-body (2L1S and 1L2S) models. The 2L2S model improves the fit compared to the three-body models, but it still leaves noticeable residuals. On the other hand, the 3L1S interpretation yields a model explaining all the major anomalous features in the lensing light curve. According to the 3L1S interpretation, the estimated mass ratios of the lens companions to the primary are $\sim 1.56 \times 10^{-3}$ and $\sim 1.75 \times 10^{-3}$, which correspond to $\sim 1.6$ and $\sim 1.8$ times the Jupiter/Sun mass ratio, respectively, and therefore the lens is a multiplanetary system containing two giant planets. With the constraints of the event time-scale and angular Einstein radius, it is found that the host of the lens system is a low-mass star of mid-to-late M spectral type with a mass of $M_{\rm h} = 0.14^{+0.19}_{-0.07}~M_\odot$, and it hosts two gas giant planets with masses of $M_{\rm p_1}=0.22^{+0.31}_{-0.12}~M_{\rm J}$ and $M_{\rm p_2}=0.25^{+0.35}_{-0.13}~M_{\rm J}$. The planets lie beyond the snow line of the host with projected separations of $a_{\perp, {\rm p}_1}=1.26^{+1.41}_{-1.08}~{\rm AU}$ and $a_{\perp, {\rm p}_2}=0.93^{+1.05}_{-0.80}~{\rm AU}$. The planetary system resides in the Galactic bulge at a distance of $D_{\rm L}=8.24^{+1.02}_{-1.16}~{\rm kpc}$. The lens of the event is the fifth confirmed multiplanetary system detected by microlensing following OGLE-2006-BLG-109L, OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L, OGLE-2018-BLG-1011L, and OGLE-2019-BLG-0468L. |

|| Feng Long, et al. -- incl., <mark>Paola Pinilla</mark> |
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in ApJ*|
|**Abstract**| The size of a disk encodes important information about its evolution. Combining new Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations with archival Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data, we analyze mm continuum and CO emission line sizes for a sample of 44 protoplanetary disks around stars with masses of 0.15--2\,$M_{\odot}$ in several nearby star-forming regions. Sizes measured from $^{12}$CO line emission span from 50 to 1000\,au. This range could be explained by viscous evolution models with different $\alpha$ values (mostly of $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$) and/or a spread of initial conditions. The CO sizes for most disks are also consistent with MHD wind models that directly remove disk angular momentum, but very large initial disk sizes would be required to account for the very extended CO disks in the sample. As no CO size evolution is observed across stellar ages of 0.5--20\,Myr in this sample, determining the dominant mechanism of disk evolution will require a more complete sample for both younger and more evolved systems. We find that the CO emission is universally more extended than the continuum emission by an average factor of $2.9\pm1.2$. The ratio of the CO to continuum sizes does not show any trend with stellar mass, mm continuum luminosity, or the properties of substructures. The GO Tau disk has the most extended CO emission in this sample, with an extreme CO to continuum size ratio of 7.6. Seven additional disks in the sample show high size ratios ($\gtrsim4$) that we interpret as clear signs of substantial radial drift. |

|| Engin Keles, et al. -- incl., <mark>Matthias Mallonn</mark>, <mark>Thomas Henning</mark> |
|*Comments*| *MNRAS, in press*|
|**Abstract**| The study of exoplanets and especially their atmospheres can reveal key insights on their evolution by identifying specific atmospheric species. For such atmospheric investigations, high-resolution transmission spectroscopy has shown great success, especially for Jupiter-type planets. Towards the atmospheric characterization of smaller planets, the super-Earth exoplanet 55 Cnc e is one of the most promising terrestrial exoplanets studied to date. Here, we present a high-resolution spectroscopic transit observation of this planet, acquired with the PEPSI instrument at the Large Binocular Telescope. Assuming the presence of Earth-like crust species on the surface of 55 Cnc e, from which a possible silicate-vapor atmosphere could have originated, we search in its transmission spectrum for absorption of various atomic and ionized species such as Fe , Fe+, Ca , Ca+, Mg and K , among others. Not finding absorption for any of the investigated species, we are able to set absorption limits with a median value of 1.9 x RP. In conclusion, we do not find evidence of a widely extended silicate envelope on this super-Earth reaching several planetary radii. |

|*Comments*| *17 pages. Submitted to MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**| We report on the discovery of a bound exoplanetary microlensing event from a blind search of data gathered from Campaign 9 of the Kepler K2 mission (K2C9). K2-2016-BLG-0005Lb is a densely sampled, binary caustic-crossing microlensing event with caustic entry and exit points that are resolved in the K2C9 data, enabling the lens-source relative proper motion to be measured. We have fitted a binary microlens model to the K2 dataset, and to simultaneous observations from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE-IV), Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA-2), the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet), and the United Kingdom InfraRed Telescope (UKIRT). Whilst the ground-based data only sparsely sample the binary caustic, they provide a clear detection of parallax that allows us to break completely the microlensing mass-position-velocity degeneracy and measure the planet's mass directly. We find a host mass of $0.58\pm0.03 ~{\rm M}_\odot$ and a planetary mass of $1.1 \pm 0.1 ~{\rm M_J}$. The system lies at a distance of $5.2 \pm 0.2~$kpc from Earth towards the Galactic bulge. The projected physical separation of the planet from its host is found to be $4.2 \pm 0.3~$au which, for circular orbits, corresponds to $a = 4.4^{+1.9}_{-0.4}~$au and period $P = 13^{+9}_{-2}~$yr, making K2-2016-BLG-0005Lb a close Jupiter analogue. Though previous exoplanet microlensing events have included space-based data, this event is the first bound microlensing exoplanet to be discovered from space-based data. Even through a space telescope not designed for microlensing studies, this result highlights the advantages for exoplanet microlensing discovery that come from continuous, high-cadence temporal sampling that is possible from space.

|| A. Rowlinson, et al. -- incl., <mark>I. Heywood</mark> |
|*Comments*| *Submitted to MNRAS, 17 pages, 13 figures*|
|**Abstract**| Many transient and variable sources detected at multiple wavelengths are also observed to vary at radio frequencies. However, these samples are typically biased towards sources that are initially detected in wide-field optical, X-ray or gamma-ray surveys. Many sources that are insufficiently bright at higher frequencies are therefore missed, leading to potential gaps in our knowledge of these sources and missing populations that are not detectable in optical, X-rays or gamma-rays. Taking advantage of new state-of-the-art radio facilities that provide high quality wide-field images with fast survey speeds, we can now conduct unbiased surveys for transient and variable sources at radio frequencies. In this paper, we present an unbiased survey using observations obtained by MeerKAT, a mid-frequency ($\sim$1.4 GHz) radio array in South Africa's Karoo Desert. The observations used were obtained as part of a weekly monitoring campaign for X-ray binaries (XRBs) and we focus on the field of MAXI J1820+070. We develop methods to optimally filter transient and variable candidates that can be directly applied to other datasets. In addition to MAXI J1820+070, we identify four likely active galactic nuclei, one source that could be a Galactic source (pulsar or quiescent X-ray binary) or an AGN, and one variable pulsar. No transient sources, defined as being undetected in deep images, were identified leading to a transient surface density of $<3.7\times10^{-2}$ deg$^{-2}$ at a sensitivity of 1 mJy on timescales of one week at 1.4 GHz. |

|| F. Wang, et al. -- incl., <mark>H.-W. Zhang</mark>, <mark>L. Zhang</mark> |
|*Comments*| *14 pages, 14 figures, accepted by MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**| We identify substructures of the Galactic halo using 3,003 type $ab$ RR Lyraes (RRab) with 6D position-velocity information from the SDSS, LAMOST, and Gaia EDR3. Based on the information, we define the separation of any two of the stars in the integrals of motion space and identify substructures by utilizing the friends-of-friends algorithm. We identify members belonging to several known substructures: the Sagittarius stream, the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES), the Sequoia, and the Helmi streams. In addition to these known substructures, there are three other substructures possibly associated with globular clusters NGC 5272, NGC 6656, and NGC 5024, respectively. Finally, we also find three remaining unknown substructures and one of them has large angular momentum and a mean metallicity $\rm -2.13\,dex$ which may be a new substructure. As for GES, we find that it accounts for a large part of substructures in the inner halo and the range of apocenter distance is from 10 to $34\,\rm kpc$, which suggests that the GES is mainly distributed in the inner halo. The near one-third proportion of the GES and the peak value $20\,\rm kpc$ of the apocenter distances suggest that GES could account for the break in the density profile of the Galactic halo at Galactocentric distance ${\sim}20-25\,\rm kpc$. The similarity of comparing the kinematic properties of Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage with the Hercules-Aquila Cloud and Virgo Overdensity suggests that the three substructures may have similar origins. |

|| Carl L. Rodriguez, et al. -- incl., <mark>Kuldeep Sharma</mark>, <mark>Andrew Wetzel</mark> |
|*Comments*| *22 pages, 16 figures, comments welcome!*|
|**Abstract**| The current generation of galaxy simulations can resolve individual giant molecular clouds, the progenitors of dense star clusters. But the evolutionary fate of these young massive clusters (YMCs), and whether they can become the old globular clusters (GCs) observed in many galaxies, is determined by a complex interplay of internal dynamical processes and external galactic effects. We present the first star-by-star $N$-body models of massive ($N\sim10^5-10^7$) star clusters formed in a FIRE-2 MHD simulation of a Milky Way-mass galaxy, with all of the relevant initial conditions and galactic tidal effects extracted directly from the cosmological simulation. We randomly select 895 ($\sim 30\%$) of the YMCs with $ > 6\times10^4M_{\odot}$ from Grudi\'c et al. 2022 and integrate them to the present day using the Cluster Monte Carlo Code, CMC. This procedure predicts a MW-like system with 148 GCs, most of which were formed during the early, bursty mode of star formation in the galaxy. Our GCs are younger, less massive, and more core collapsed than clusters in the Milky Way or M31. This is a direct result of the assembly history and age-metallicity relationship of the GCs' host galaxy: younger clusters are preferentially born in stronger galactic tidal fields and initially retain fewer stellar-mass black holes, causing them to lose mass faster and reach core collapse sooner than their older counterparts. Our results suggest that the masses and core/half-light radii of GCs are shaped not only by internal dynamical processes, but by the specific evolutionary history of their host galaxies as well. These results emphasize that $N$-body studies with realistic stellar physics are crucial to understanding the evolution and present-day properties of galactic GC systems. |

|*Comments*| *8 pages, 6 figures, contribution to the 2022 Cosmology session of the 56th Rencontres de Moriond*|
|**Abstract**| For the past decade, the BICEP/Keck collaboration has been operating a series of telescopes at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station measuring degree-scale $B$-mode polarization imprinted in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by primordial gravitational waves (PGWs). These telescopes are compact refracting polarimeters mapping about 2% of the sky, observing at a broad range of frequencies to account for the polarized foreground from Galactic synchrotron and thermal dust emission. Our latest publication "BK18" utilizes the data collected up to the 2018 observing season, in conjunction with the publicly available WMAP and Planck data, to constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. It particularly includes (1) the 3-year BICEP3 data which is the current deepest CMB polarization map at the foreground-minimum 95 GHz; and (2) the Keck 220 GHz map with a higher signal-to-noise ratio on the dust foreground than the Planck 353 GHz map. We fit the auto- and cross-spectra of these maps to a multicomponent likelihood model ($\Lambda$CDM+dust+synchrotron+noise+$r$) and find it to be an adequate description of the data at the current noise level. The likelihood analysis yields $\sigma(r)=0.009$. The inference of $r$ from our baseline model is tightened to $r_{0.05}=0.014^{+0.010}_{-0.011}$ and $r_{0.05}<0.036$ at 95% confidence, meaning that the BICEP/Keck $B$-mode data is the most powerful existing dataset for the constraint of PGWs. The up-coming BICEP Array telescope is projected to reach $\sigma(r) \lesssim 0.003$ using data up to 2027. |

|*Comments*| *23 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables; to be submitted to AAS Journals; public data release at this https URL arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2103.07476*|
|**Abstract**| We present the second public data release (DR2) from the DECam Local Volume Exploration survey (DELVE). DELVE DR2 combines new DECam observations with archival DECam data from the Dark Energy Survey, the DECam Legacy Survey, and other DECam community programs. DELVE DR2 consists of ~160,000 exposures that cover >21,000 deg^2 of the high Galactic latitude (|b| > 10 deg) sky in four broadband optical/near-infrared filters (g, r, i, z). DELVE DR2 provides point-source and automatic aperture photometry for ~2.5 billion astronomical sources with a median 5{\sigma} point-source depth of g=24.3, r=23.9, i=23.5, and z=22.8 mag. A region of ~17,000 deg^2 has been imaged in all four filters, providing four-band photometric measurements for ~618 million astronomical sources. DELVE DR2 covers more than four times the area of the previous DELVE data release and contains roughly five times as many astronomical objects. DELVE DR2 is publicly available via the NOIRLab Astro Data Lab science platform. |

|| K. R. Ferguson, et al. -- incl., <mark>A. T. Lee</mark> |
|*Comments*| *16 pages, 5 figures, to be submitted to Physical Review D*|
|**Abstract**| Ultralight axion-like particles (ALPs) are compelling dark matter candidates because of their potential to resolve small-scale discrepancies between $\Lambda$CDM predictions and cosmological observations. Axion-photon coupling induces a polarization rotation in linearly polarized photons traveling through an ALP field; thus, as the local ALP dark matter field oscillates in time, distant static polarized sources will appear to oscillate with a frequency proportional to the ALP mass. We use observations of the cosmic microwave background from SPT-3G, the current receiver on the South Pole Telescope, to set upper limits on the value of the axion-photon coupling constant $g_{\phi\gamma}$ over the approximate mass range $10^{-22} - 10^{-19}$ eV, corresponding to oscillation periods from 12 hours to 100 days. For periods between 1 and 100 days ($4.7 \times 10^{-22} \text{ eV} \leq m_\phi \leq 4.7 \times 10^{-20} \text{ eV}$), where the limit is approximately constant, we set a median 95% C.L. upper limit on the amplitude of on-sky polarization rotation of 0.071 deg. Assuming that dark matter comprises a single ALP species with a local dark matter density of $0.3 \text{ GeV/cm}^3$, this corresponds to $g_{\phi\gamma} < 1.18 \times 10^{-12}\text{ GeV}^{-1} \times \left( \frac{m_{\phi}}{1.0 \times 10^{-21} \text{ eV}} \right)$. These new limits represent an improvement over the previous strongest limits set using the same effect by a factor of ~3.8. |

|| <mark>Christian Eistrup</mark>, et al. |
|*Comments*| *5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to Acta Prima Aprilia*|
|**Abstract**| Caffeination can open tired eyes and enhance focus. Over-caffeination, furthermore, can lead to errors but also to unexpected discoveries that might not have happened without 30 hours of sleep deprivation and 500mg of caffeine in our bodies. This paper presents exactly such a discovery. Upon much staring into our coffee cups, empty anew, the thought struck us: coffee in space. Caffeine may not be the only key. HL Tau, Taurus, bull... Taurine! We grinded some red bourbon for a new pour-over, and developed the new, coffee-groundsbreaking Large Astrocomical Taurine Tester Experiment (LATTE) in just 1/4 of a day. We felt bull-ish about our chances of making a great discovery! We installed LATTE, aimed it at the well-known young star HL Tau, and there it was: an abundance of taurine gas beautifully outlining a cup of cosmic flat white, with the ring structure of HL Tau turning out to be latte art performed by a skillful cosmic barista. The first Robusta discovery of coffee in space. Speaking of coffee, we hope you have a nice hot cup with you, and we encourage you to pun-tinue all the way to the end of this bean-grinding paper. |

|| Ivanna Escala, et al. -- incl., <mark>Robyn E. Sanderson</mark> |
|*Comments*| *21 pages main text, 15 figures, 5 tables (including Appendix). Submitted to AJ*|
|**Abstract**| We obtained Keck/DEIMOS spectra of 556 individual red giant branch stars in 4 spectroscopic fields spanning $13-31$ projected kpc along the Northeast (NE) shelf of M31. We present the first detection of a complete wedge pattern in the space of projected M31-centric radial distance versus line-of-sight velocity for this feature, which includes the returning stream component of the shelf. This wedge pattern agrees with expectations of a tidal shell formed in a radial merger and provides strong evidence in favor of predictions of Giant Stellar Stream (GSS) formation models in which the NE shelf originates from the second orbital wrap of the tidal debris. The observed concentric wedge patterns of the NE, West (W), and Southeast (SE) shelves corroborate this interpretation independently of the models. We do not detect a kinematical signature in the NE shelf region corresponding to an intact progenitor core, favoring GSS formation models in which the progenitor is completely disrupted. The shelf's photometric metallicity distribution implies that it is dominated by tidal material, as opposed to the phase-mixed stellar halo or the disk. The metallicity distribution ([Fe/H]$_{\rm phot}$ = $-0.42$ $\pm$ $0.01$) also matches the GSS, and consequently the W and SE shelves, further supporting a direct physical association between the tidal features. |

|| Yu-Ling Chang, et al. -- incl., <mark>Liang Chen</mark> |
|*Comments*| *30 pages, 18 figures*|
|**Abstract**| Pinpointing the neutrino sources is crucial to unveil the mystery of high-energy cosmic rays. The search for neutrino-source candidates from coincident neutrino-photon signatures and electromagnetic objects with peculiar flaring behaviors have the potential to increase our chances of finding neutrino emitters. In this paper, we first study the temporal correlations of astrophysical flares with neutrinos, considering a few hundreds of multi-frequency sources from ALMA, WISE, Swift, and Fermi in the containment regions of IceCube high-energy alerts. Furthermore, the spatial correlations between blazars and neutrinos are investigated using the subset of 10-year IceCube track-like neutrinos with around 250 thousand events. In the second test, we account for 2700 blazars with different types of flaring phases in addition to sole position. No significant neutrino emissions were found from our analyses. Our results indicate an interesting trend showing the infrared flaring stages of WISE blazars might be correlated with arrival times of the neutrino alerts. Possible overflow of neutrinos associated with two of our blazar sub-samples are also illustrated. One is characterized by a significant flaring lag in infrared with respect to gamma-rays, like seen for TXS0506+056, and the other is characterized by highly simultaneous infrared and gamma-ray flares. These phenomena suggest the need to improve current multi-frequency light-curve catalogs to pair with the advent of more sensitive neutrino observatories. |

|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**| Presently, Pluto and Charon have been in tidal locking and the ratio of Pluto and Charon's spin velocity to the orbital mean motion is $1$. We test the effect of tidal evolution at Pluto-Charon and register the possibilities of the initial states with $\Delta t$ model and $Q$ model. In $\Delta t$ model, the tidal evolution equation will have an unnecessary overshoot, so we find a more exact tidal evolution equation for the $Q$ model. Besides we consider the influence of inclination and discuss the model with a high semi-major axis and high eccentricity. |

|| Zhenping Yi, et al. -- incl., <mark>Zengxu Liang</mark> |
|*Comments*| *11 pages, 9 figures,accepted to be published on MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**| Low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies are galaxies with central surface brightness fainter than the night sky. Due to the faint nature of LSB galaxies and the comparable sky background, it is difficult to search LSB galaxies automatically and efficiently from large sky survey. In this study, we established the Low Surface Brightness Galaxies Auto Detect model (LSBG-AD), which is a data-driven model for end-to-end detection of LSB galaxies from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) images. Object detection techniques based on deep learning are applied to the SDSS field images to identify LSB galaxies and estimate their coordinates at the same time. Applying LSBG-AD to 1120 SDSS images, we detected 1197 LSB galaxy candidates, of which 1081 samples are already known and 116 samples are newly found candidates. The B-band central surface brightness of the candidates searched by the model ranges from 22 mag arcsec $^ {- 2} $ to 24 mag arcsec $^ {- 2} $, quite consistent with the surface brightness distribution of the standard sample. 96.46\% of LSB galaxy candidates have an axis ratio ($b/a$) greater than 0.3, and 92.04\% of them have $fracDev\_r$\textless 0.4, which is also consistent with the standard sample. The results show that the LSBG-AD model learns the features of LSB galaxies of the training samples well, and can be used to search LSB galaxies without using photometric parameters. Next, this method will be used to develop efficient algorithms to detect LSB galaxies from massive images of the next generation observatories. |

|**Abstract**| Magnetars are neutron stars with extreme magnetic field and sometimes manifest as soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs). SGR J1935+2154 is one of the most prolific bursters and the first confirmed source of fast radio burst (i.e. FRB 200428). Encouraged by the discovery of the first X-ray counterpart of FRB, Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) implemented a dedicated 33-day long ToO observation of SGR J1935+2154 since April 28, 2020. With the HE, ME, and LE telescopes, Insight-HXMT provides a thorough monitoring of burst activity evolution of SGR J1935+2154, in a very broad energy range (1-250 keV) with high temporal resolution and high sensitivity, resulting in a unique valuable data set for detailed studies of SGR J1935+2154. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of this observation including detailed burst search, identification and temporal analyses. After carefully removing false triggers, we find a total of 75 bursts from SGR J1935+2154, out of which 70 are single-pulsed. The maximum burst rate is about 56 bursts/day. Both the burst duration and the waiting time between two successive bursts follow log-normal distributions, consistent with previous studies. We also find that bursts with longer duration (some are multi-pulsed) tend to occur during the period with relatively high burst rate. There is no correlation between the waiting time and the fluence or duration of either the former or latter burst. It also seems that there is no correlation between burst duration and hardness ratio, in contrast to some previous reports. In addition, we do not find any X-ray burst associated with any reported radio bursts except for FRB 200428. |

|*Comments*| *24 pages, 21 figures*|
|**Abstract**| We analyse five early science datasets from the APERture Tile in Focus (Apertif) phased array feed system to verify the polarisation capabilities of Apertif in view of future larger data releases. We aim to characterise the source population of the polarised sky in the L-Band using polarised source information in combination with IR and optical data. We use automatic routines to generate full field-of-view Q- and U-cubes and perform RM-Synthesis, source finding, and cross-matching with published radio, optical, and IR data to generate polarised source catalogues. SED-fitting routines were used to determine photometric redshifts, star-formation rates, and galaxy masses. IR colour information was used to classify sources as AGN or star-forming-dominated and early- or late-type. We surveyed an area of 56deg$^2$ and detected 1357 polarised source components in 1170 sources. The fraction of polarised sources is 10.57% with a median fractional polarisation of 4.70$\pm$0.14%. We confirmed the reliability of the Apertif measurements by comparing them with polarised cross-identified NVSS sources. Average RMs of the individual fields lie within the error of the best Milky Way foreground measurements. All of our polarised sources were found to be dominated by AGN activity in the radio regime with most of them being radio-loud (79%) and of the FRII class (87%). The host galaxies of our polarised source sample are dominated by intermediate disc and star-forming disc galaxies. The contribution of star formation to the radio emission is on the order of a few percent for $\approx$10% of the polarised sources while for $\approx$90% it is completely dominated by the AGN. We do not see any change in fractional polarisation for different star-formation rates of the AGN host galaxies. |

|**Abstract**| Interstellar scintillation analysis of pulsars allows us to probe the small-scale distribution and inhomogeneities of the ionized interstellar medium. Our priority is to present the data set and the basic measurements of scintillation parameters of pulsars employing long-term scintillation observations carried out from 2011 January to 2020 August by the European Pulsar Timing Array radio telescopes in the 21-cm and 11-cm bands. Additionally, we aim to identify future possible lines of study using this long-term scintillation dataset. We present the long-term time series of $\nu_{\rm d}$ and $\tau_{\rm d}$ for 13 pulsars. Sanity-checks and comparisons indicate that the scintillation parameters of our work and previously published works are mostly consistent. For two pulsars, PSRs~J1857+0943 and J1939+2134, we were able to obtain measurements of the $\nu_{\rm d}$ at both bands, which allows us to derive the time series of frequency scaling indices with a mean and a standard deviation of 2.82$\pm$1.95 and 3.18$\pm$0.60, respectively. We found some interesting features which will be studied in more detail in subsequent papers in this series: (i) in the time series of PSR~J1939+2134, where the scintillation bandwidth sharply increases or decreases associated with a sharp change of dispersion measure; (ii) PSR~J0613$-$0200 and PSR~J0636+5126 show a strong annual variation in the time series of the $\tau_{\rm d}$; (iii) PSR~J1939+2134 shows a weak anti-correlation between scintillation timescale and dispersion in WSRT data. |

|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**| We present a detailed study of the optical and NIR emission and absorption line spectrum of the quasar SDSS J163345.22+512748.4. We discovered on the newly acquired NIR spectrum a highly meta-stable neutral helium broad absorption line (BAL) \heiozetz\ with a width of $\sim$ 2000 \kmps\ and a blueshift of $\sim$ 7000 \kmps\ in the velocity space. The BAL system is also significantly detected in \mgii\ and \heiteen. We estimate a column density of $(5.0 \pm 1.7) \times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the HeI*(2~$^3$S) level, and infer an ionization parameter of $U_{A} = 10^{-1.9\pm 0.2}$ for the BAL outflow assuming that the BAL region is thick enough for a full development of an ionization front. The total column density of the BAL outflow is constrained in the range N$\rm _{H}$ $\sim$ 10$^{21}$-10$^{21.4}$ cm$^{-2}$. We also found that the bulk of both MgII and UV FeII, as well as H$\alpha$ broad emission lines (BELs) are blueshifted with a velocity of $\sim$ 2200 \kmps\ with respect to the quasar systemic redshift. We constrain that the blueshifted BEL region has a covering factor $C_{f}\approx 16\%$, a density n$\rm _{H}$ $\sim $ 10$^{10.6}$-10$^{11.3}$ cm$^{-3}$, a column density N$\rm _{H}\gtrsim 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and an ionization parameter $U_{E}\sim 10^{-2.1}-10^{-1.5}$. The outflow gas is located at $\sim$0.1 pc away from the central ionization source, at a scale comparable to the BLR. A toy kinetic model has been proposed to reproduce the profile of MgII BEL well if assuming a partial obscured axisymmetric geometry of the outflow with a radial velocity as observed by the BALs. |

|| Estrella Florido, Almudena Zurita, <mark>Enrique Pérez-Montero</mark> |
|*Comments*| *14 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**| We use a sample of 536 \hii\ regions located in nearby spirals, with an homogeneous determination of their $T_e$-based abundances, to obtain new empirical calibrations of the N2O2, N2S2, O3N2, and N2 strong-line indices to estimate the nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratio when auroral lines are not detected. All indices are strongly correlated with the $T_e$-based $\log$(N/O) for our \hii\ region sample, even more strongly than with $12+\log$(O/H). N2O2 is the most strongly correlated index, and the best fit to the $\log$(N/O)-N2O2 relation is obtained with a second-order polynomial. The derived relation has a low dispersion ({\em rms}$<$0.09~dex), being valid in the range $-1.74 < $ N2O2 $< 0.62$ (or $-1.81 < $ $\log$(N/O) $< -0.13$). We have compared our calibration with previous ones and have discussed the differences between them in terms of the nature of the objects used as calibrators. |

|*Comments*| *25 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in RAA*|
|**Abstract**| Photometric redshift (photo-z) is a fundamental parameter for multi-wavelength photometric surveys, while galaxy clusters are important cosmological probers and ideal objects for exploring the dense environmental impact on galaxy evolution. We extend our previous work on estimating photo-z and detecting galaxy clusters to the latest data releases of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging surveys, Dark Energy Survey (DES), and Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) imaging surveys and make corresponding catalogs publicly available for more extensive scientific applications. The photo-z catalogs include accurate measurements of photo-z and stellar mass for about 320, 293, and 134 million galaxies with $r<23$, $i<24$, and $i<25$ in DESI DR9, DES DR2, and HSC-SSP PDR3 data, respectively. The photo-z accuracy is about 0.017, 0.024, and 0.029 and the general redshift coverage is $z<1$, $z<1.2$, and $z<1.6$, respectively for those three surveys. The uncertainties of the logarithmic stellar mass that is inferred from stellar population synthesis fitting is about 0.2 dex. With the above photo-z catalogs, galaxy clusters are detected using a fast cluster-finding algorithm. A total of 532,810, 86,963, and 36,566 galaxy clusters with the number of members larger than 10 are discovered for DESI, DES, and HSC-SSP, respectively. Their photo-z accuracy is at the level of 0.01. The total mass of our clusters are also estimated by using the calibration relations between the optical richness and the mass measurement from X-ray and radio observations. The photo-z and cluster catalogs are available at ScienceDB (https://www.scidb.cn/s/2AjaEb) and PaperData Repository (https://nadc.china-vo.org/article/20200722160959?id=101089). |

|**Abstract**| Despite all its well-known flaws and calls for its dismissal, the notorious $h$-index is still used in many instances when awarding grants, or promoting and hiring scientists. To address this, I set out to devise a better index, with the twofold aim of taking into account the authors' respective contributions and considerably reducing the pollution of the scientific literature. Finally, I present a strategy that is guaranteed to be best for all researchers. |

|*Comments*| *To be submitted to MNRAS, comments welcome!*|
|**Abstract**| The Zwicky Transient Transient Facility (ZTF) performs a systematic neutrino follow-up program, searching for optical counterparts to high-energy neutrinos with dedicated Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) observations. Since first light in March 2018, ZTF has taken prompt observations for 24 high-quality neutrino alerts from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, with a median latency of 12.2 hours from initial neutrino detection. From two of these campaigns, we have already reported tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2019dsg and likely TDE AT2019fdr as probable counterparts, suggesting that TDEs contribute >7.8% of the astrophysical neutrino flux. We here present the full results of our program through to December 2021. No additional candidate neutrino sources were identified by our program, allowing us to place the first constraints on the underlying optical luminosity function of astrophysical neutrino sources. Transients with optical absolutes magnitudes brighter that -21 can contribute no more than 87% of the total, while transients brighter than -22 can contribute no more than 58% of the total, neglecting the effect of extinction. These are the the first observational constraints on the neutrino emission of bright populations such as superluminous supernovae. None of the neutrinos were coincident with bright optical AGN flares comparable to that observed for TXS 0506+056/IC170922A, suggesting that most astrophysical neutrinos are not produced during such optical flares. We highlight the outlook for electromagnetic neutrino follow-up programs, including the expected potential for the Rubin Observatory. |

|*Comments*| *21 pages, 14 figures, 3 tables, 62 floofers*|
|**Abstract**| With the proliferation of online Zoom meetings as a means of doing science in the 2020s, astronomers have made new and unexpected Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations. Chief among these ToOs are observations of exop(lan)ets, or "exopets." Building on the work of Mayorga et al. (2021) - whose work characterized the rotational variations of "floofy" objects - we model exopets using methods similar to those used for exoplanetary transits. We present data collected for such exopet Zoom transits through a citizen science program in the month of February 2022. The dataset includes parameters like exopet color, floofiness, transit duration, and percentage of Zoom screen covered during the event. For some targets, we also present microlensing and direct imaging data. Using results from our modelling of 62 exopet observations as transits, microlensing, and direct imaging events, we discuss our inferences of exopet characteristics like their masses, sizes, orbits, colors, and floofiness. |
