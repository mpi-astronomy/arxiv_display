|**Abstract**|            Extremely large mass-ratio inspirals (XMRIs), consisting of a brown dwarf orbiting a supermassive black hole, emit long-lived and nearly monochromatic gravitational waves in the millihertz band and constitute a promising probe of strong-field gravity and black-hole properties. However, dedicated data-analysis pipelines for XMRI signals have not yet been established. In this work, we develop, for the first time, a hierarchical semi-coherent search pipeline for XMRIs tailored to space-based gravitational-wave detectors, with a particular focus on the TianQin mission. The pipeline combines a semi-coherent multi-harmonic $\mathcal{F}$-statistic with particle swarm optimization, and incorporates a novel eccentricity estimation method based on the relative power distribution among harmonics. We validate the performance of the pipeline using simulated TianQin data for a Galactic center XMRI composed of a brown dwarf and Sgr A*. For a three-month observation, the pipeline successfully recovers the signal and achieves high-precision parameter estimation, including fractional uncertainties of $<10^{-6}$ in the orbital frequency, $\lesssim10^{-3}$ in the eccentricity, $\lesssim2\times10^{-3}$ in the black-hole mass, and $\lesssim10^{-3}$ in the black-hole spin. Our framework establishes a practical foundation for future XMRI searches with space-based detectors and highlights the potential of XMRIs as precision probes of stellar dynamics and strong-field gravity in the vicinity of supermassive black holes.         |

|**Abstract**|            To deepen our understanding of star-forming properties, we studied a massive protocluster IRAS 15596-5301 using ALMA 870 um and 3 mm data. High-resolution 870 um data reveal 34 dense cores, including 3 hot molecular cores, with subsequent line surveys detecting 22 molecular species toward them. Two velocity components (I15596-red/I15596-blue) were found in the averaged H13CO+(1-0) spectrum, and two filaments were identified from velocity-resolved integrated intensity maps. A spatial overlap between the two filaments was observed, and this overlapping region exhibits a distinct bridge-shaped feature in the position-velocity diagram constructed along the entire filamentary structures. Combined with the reduced H13CO+/HCO+ ratio in the overlapping region and the three-dimensional position-position-velocity cube data, we conclude that a non-head-on collision occurs between the edges of the two filamentary structures in IRAS 15596-5301. Cluster analysis demonstrates that clusters located in the collision region host more evolved chemical rich dense cores than their counterparts in other regions. Our results thus indicate that star formation in I15596 is triggered or accelerated by a mild non-head-on collision between two filaments.         |

|| L. Ma, et al. -- incl., <mark>Y. Wu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-02-02*|
|*Comments*| *19 pages, 5 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            The size-velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) relation, while well established for giant HII regions, remains uncertain for their smaller counterparts (physical radii R < 20 pc). Thanks to the LAMOST MRS-N dataset's large sky coverage and high spatial/spectral resolution, we examined this relationship using 10 isolated Galactic HII regions with R < 20 pc. Our results reveal two key findings: (1) these small-size HII regions remarkably follow the same size-$\sigma$ relation as giant HII regions, suggesting this correlation could serve as a novel distance indicator for Galactic HII regions; and (2) we find distinct dynamical behaviors between younger and older HII regions. Specifically, in younger (< 0.5 Myr), ionization-bounded HII regions, the velocity dispersion shows no correlation with expansion velocity, indicating that turbulence is driven primarily by stellar winds and ionization processes. In contrast, in older (> 0.5 Myr), matter-bounded HII regions, a clear correlation emerges, implying that expansion-driven processes begin to play a significant role in generating turbulence. We therefore propose an evolutionary transition in the primary turbulence mechanisms, from being dominated by stellar winds and radiation to being increasingly influenced by expansion-driven dynamics, during the evolution of HII regions. Considering the small sample size used in this work, particularly the inclusion of only two young HII regions, which also have large uncertainties in their expansion velocities, further confirmation of this interpretation will require higher-resolution 2D spectroscopy to resolve blended kinematic components along the line of sight for more accurate estimation of expansion velocities, along with an expanded sample that specifically includes more young HII regions.         |

|| S. Day-Weiss, et al. -- incl., <mark>Y. Wang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-02-02*|
|*Comments*| *8 pages, 2 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            We present the on-sky performance of a Radio-Transparent Multi-Layer Insulation filter (RT-MLI) that uses Styroace-II styrofoam to reject ambient thermal radiation from entering a 0.42 m diameter aperture to a sub-100 mK bolometric detector array cooled by a dilution-refrigerator. We find that greater than 90% of the expected incident infra-red (IR) radiation is rejected, resulting in $<$12 W of measured transmitted power. Transmitted power in the detector passbands is consistent with a lower bound of 95%. We address filter design and placement, thermal loading, and mm-wave transmission.         |
