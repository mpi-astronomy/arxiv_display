|**Abstract**| Context. High-resolution spectroscopy has the potential to drive a better understanding of the atmospheric composition, physics, and dynamics of young exoplanets and brown dwarfs, bringing clear insights into the formation channel of individual objects. Aims. Using the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC; R = 35,000), we aim to characterize a young brown dwarf HD 984 B. By measuring its C/O and 12CO/13CO ratios, we expect to gain new knowledge about its origin by confirming the difference in the formation pathways between brown dwarfs and super-Jupiters. Methods. We analysed the KPIC high-resolution spectrum (2.29-2.49 {\mu}m) of HD 984 B using an atmospheric retrieval framework based on nested sampling and petitRADTRANS, using both clear and cloudy models. Results. Using our best-fit model, we find C/O = 0.50+0.01-0.01 (0.01 is the statistical error) for HD 984 B which agrees with that of its host star within 1{\sigma} (0.40+0.20-0.20). We also retrieve an isotopolog 12CO/13CO ratio of 98+20-25 in its atmosphere, which is similar to that of the Sun. In addition, HD 984 B has a substellar metallicity with [Fe/H] = -0.62+0.02-0.02. Finally, we find that most of the retrieved parameters are independent of our choice of retrieval model. Conclusions. From our measured C/O and 12CO/13CO, the favored formation mechanism of HD 984 B seems to be via gravitational collapse or disk instability and not core accretion, which is a favored formation mechanism for giant exoplanets with m < 13 MJup and semimajor axis between 10 and 100 au. However, with only a few brown dwarfs with a measured 12CO/13CO ratio, similar analyses using high-resolution spectroscopy will become essential in order to determine planet formation processes more precisely. |

|**Abstract**| Space-based missions studying the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have progressively refined the parameter space in conventional models of inflation shortly ($\sim 10^{-37}$ seconds) after the big bang. While most inflationary scenarios proposed thus far in the context of GR have since been ruled out, the basic idea of inflation may still be tenable, albeit with several unresolved conundrums, such as conflicting initial conditions and inconsistencies with the measured CMB power spectrum. In the new slow-roll inflationary picture, inflation arising in plateau-like potentials requires an initiation beyond the Planck time. This delay may be consistent with the cutoff, $k_{\rm min}$, measured recently in the primordial power spectrum. However, the actual value of $k_{\rm min}$ would imply an initiation time too far beyond the big bang for inflation to solve the horizon problem. In this paper, we also describe several other undesirable consequences of this delay, including an absence of well motivated initial conditions and a significant difficulty providing a viable mechanism for properly quantizing the primordial fluctuations. Nevertheless, many of these inconsistencies may still be avoided if one introduces non-conventional modifications to inflation, such as a brief departure from slow-roll dynamics, possibly due to a dramatic change in the inflationary potential, inflation driven by multiple fields, or a non-minimal coupling to gravity. In addition, some of these difficulties could be mitigated via the use of alternative cosmologies based, e.g., on loop quantum gravity, which replaces the initial big-bang singularity with finite conditions at a bounce-like beginning. |
