|**Abstract**|            We investigate the magnetic field orientation and strength in the massive star-forming region G35.20-0.74N (G35), using polarized dust emission data obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) as part of the Magnetic fields in Massive star-forming Regions (MagMaR) survey. The G35 region shows a filamentary structure (a length of $\sim$0.1 pc) with six bright cores located along the filament's long axis. Magnetic field strengths across the G35 region range from 0.2 to 4.4 mG with a mean value of 0.8 $\pm$ 0.4 mG. The mass-to-flux ratio ($\lambda$) varies from 0.1 to 6.0 the critical value. The highest values are found locally around cores, whereas the remains of the filament are subcritical. A H$^{13}$CO$^+$ (3--2) velocity gradient of 29 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ is evident along the filament's long axis, aligned with the magnetic field direction. At larger scales ($\sim$0.1 pc), the magnetic field lines appear roughly perpendicular to the filament's long axis, in contrast to the smaller-scale structure ($\sim$0.003 pc) traced by ALMA. The magnetic field lines could be dragged along the filament as a result of the gas motion induced by the gravitational potential of the filament. Six cores in the filament have similar spacings between 0.02--0.04 pc. The initial filament fragmentation could have produced a core spacing of 0.06 pc, following filament fragmentation theory, and the current core spacing is the result of cores comoving with the gas along the filament. This core migration could occur in a few 10$^4$ years, consistent with high-mass star formation time scales.         |

|**Abstract**|            The scope of this paper is focused on the question if gas is transported to dense clumps inside high-mass star-forming regions through filamentary structures on a scale of several parsecs to the sub-parsec scale. We quantify the gas flows from a scale of up to several parsecs down to the sub-parsec scale along filamentary structures. In this work the accretion flow mechanisms based on gas kinematic data in the three high-mass star-forming regions G75.78, IRAS21078+5211 and NGC7538 are studied with data obtained from the IRAM 30 m telescope. The analysis is carried out using the surface density derived from 1.2 mm continuum emission and velocity differences estimated from HCO+ and H13CO+ molecular line data.         |

|**Abstract**|            Aims. eROSITA on board of the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) spacecraft performed its first X-ray all-sky survey (eRASS1) between December 2019 and June 2020. It detected about 930000 sources, providing us with an unprecedented opportunity for a detailed blazar census. We present the properties of blazars and blazar candidates in eRASS1 and the compilation of the eROSITA blazar catalog. Methods. We compile a list of blazar and blazar candidates from the literature and match it with the eRASS1 catalog, creating the Blazars in eRASS1 (BlazEr1) catalog. For sources with more than 50 counts we obtain their X-ray spectral properties. We compile multiwavelength data from the radio to the gamma-ray regimes for all sources, including multiwavelength spectral indices and redshifts. The full catalog is available online. Results. We present the BlazEr1 catalog, containing 5865 sources, of which 2106 are associated with confirmed blazars. For 3668 sources, eROSITA provides the first X-ray data. The contamination from non-blazar sources of the entire sample is less than 11%. Most candidates exhibit properties typical for blazars. We present properties of the entire X-ray detected blazar population, including the distributions of X-ray luminosities and photon indices, multiwavelength properties, and the blazar log N-log S distribution. Our catalog provides follow up targets, such as potential MeV and TeV blazars. Conclusions. The BlazEr1 catalog provides a compilation of X-ray detected blazars and blazar candidates. The catalog serves as a starting point for exploiting further eROSITA surveys using the same methodology, enabling us to study the X-ray variability and a large number of spectral energy distributions of blazars in the future.         |

|**Abstract**|            The initial-final mass relation (IFMR) links a star's birth mass to the mass of its white dwarf (WD) remnant, providing key constraints on stellar evolution. Open clusters offer the most straightforward way to empirically determine the IFMR, as their well-defined ages allow for direct progenitor lifetime estimates. We construct the most comprehensive open cluster WD IFMR to date by combining new spectroscopy of 22 WDs with an extensive literature review of WDs with strong cluster associations. To minimize systematics, we restrict our analysis to spectroscopically confirmed hydrogen-atmosphere (DA) WDs consistent with single-stellar origins. We separately analyze a subset with reliable Gaia-based astrometric membership assessments, as well as a full sample that adds WDs with strong cluster associations whose membership cannot be reliably assessed with Gaia. The Gaia-based sample includes 69 spectroscopically confirmed DA WDs, more than doubling the sample size of previous Gaia-based open cluster IFMRs. The full sample, which includes 53 additional literature WDs, increases the total number of cluster WDs by over $50\%$ relative to earlier works. We provide functional forms for both the Gaia-based and full-sample IFMRs. The Gaia-based result useful for $M_i \geq 2.67\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ is $$M_f = \left[0.179 - 0.100 H(M_i-3.84\,\mathrm{M}_\odot) \right ] \times (M_i-3.84\,\mathrm{M}_\odot)+0.628\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$$ where $H(x)$ is the Heaviside step function. Comparing our IFMR to recent literature, we identify significant deviations from best-fit IFMRs derived from both Gaia-based volume limited samples of field WDs and double WD binaries, with the largest discrepancy occurring for initial masses of about $5\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$.         |

|| <mark>H. Jiang</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-30*|
|*Comments*| *15 pages, 7 figures, ApJ accepted*|
|**Abstract**|            The diminishing of star formation is accompanied by size differentiating, as quiescent galaxies are more compact than star-forming galaxies at fixed stellar mass. In order to understand how galaxy quenching is related to galaxy sizes, we performed a demographic study of 46 massive quiescent central galaxies with stellar mass from $10^{10.5}\rm M_\odot$ to $10^{11}\rm M_\odot$ in the TNG50 simulation. We found that, in addition to the triggering active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, galaxy size is also a major determinant of the quenching process, as small and compact galaxies are immediately quenched by the kinetic AGN feedback, while galaxies with large sizes are still active until strangulated by the cutoff of new gas replenishment. Further spatially resolved inspection reveals that this short and intense kinetic AGN feedback can only suppress the star formation within 1-2 kpc, resulting in this size-dependent effect of quenching. We also identify a long-term effect of a few Gyr timescale that the gas inflow rate is progressively suppressed after triggering kinetic feedback, which appears to effectively quench large galaxies entirely. We conclude that kinetic AGN feedback has two key roles in quenching: a short-term, intense effect that quenches the central 2 kpc region, and a long-term effect that suppresses the gas inflow rate and further quenches the entire galaxy.         |

|**Abstract**|            Detecting gaseous debris disks around white dwarfs offers a unique window into the ultimate fate of planetary systems and the composition of accreted planetary material. Here we present a systematic search for such disks through the Ca II infrared triplet using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Early Data Release. From a parent sample of 2706 spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs, we identify 22 candidate systems showing tentative emission-line features, which corresponds to a raw occurrence rate of 0.81%, more than ten times higher than previous estimates. The detected emission lines are predominantly weak and require confirmation by follow-up observations. Three of these candidates also exhibit infrared excess in WISE photometry, suggesting a possible coexistence of gas and dust. However, the high candidate rate indicates that most are likely false positives due to telluric residuals or unresolved binaries. This work demonstrates the potential of DESI spectra for blind searches of rare circumstellar phenomena. The recently released DESI DR1, with its substantially larger spectroscopic sample, will enable searches for more gaseous disks and provide better insights into their occurrence and nature.         |

|**Abstract**|            X-ray observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT 2019avd show drastic variabilities in flux and spectral shape over hundreds of days, providing clues on the accretion disc-corona evolution. We utilize a disc-corona model, in which a fraction of the gravitational energy released in the disc is transported into the hot corona above/below. Some soft photons emitted from the disc are upscattered to X-ray photons by the hot electrons in the optically thin corona. By fitting the NICER observations of AT 2019avd during epochs when the spectra exhibit significant hardening, we derive the evolution of the mass accretion rate, $\dot{m}$, and the coronal energy fraction, $f$. Our results show that $f$ decreases with increasing $\dot{m}$, which is qualitatively consistent with that observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), while the slope of this source, $f\propto \dot{m}^{-0.30}$, is much shallower than that of AGNs. We also find that the non-thermal X-ray spectrum in this source is significantly softer than those typically seen in AGNs and black-hole X-ray binaries. We argue that these quantitative differences can be a powerful diagnostic of the underlying magnetic turbulence, which may imply a stronger magnetic field within the TDE accretion disc than that in typical AGNs. It is also found that the evolution of the fitted neutral hydrogen column density follows a similar pattern to that of the accretion rate evolution, which may reflect the accumulation of absorbing material originating from the inflowing streams of stellar debris and/or other related sources.         |

|**Abstract**|            At low redshift, massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) are most frequently found in massive, rich galaxy clusters, but at high redshift the trend is less clear. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence of the effects of environment on the formation and assembly of high-redshift MQGs. We identify 25 (5) $\log (M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}\geq10.5$ ($10.0\leq\log (M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}<10.5$) spectroscopically-confirmed quiescent galaxies in the UDS and EGS fields at $3<z<5$ with NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy from RUBIES and other public JWST NIRSpec programs. We measure the density contrast in these fields by applying a Monte Carlo Voronoi Tesselation density mapping technique to photometric and spectroscopic redshifts of $m_\mathrm{F444W}<27.5$ sources. We robustly detect 12 massive overdense peaks with $\log (M_\mathrm{Peak}/\mathrm{M_\odot})\geq13$ and six extended massive protoclusters ($\log (M_\mathrm{Struct}/\mathrm{M_\odot})\geq13.85$). We observe that MQGs are preferentially found in these massive peaks and within these massive structures: $\approx50\%$ of MQGs are found in massive peaks, compared to $\approx20\%$ of massive star forming galaxies (MSFGs) and $\approx15\%$ of the overall spectroscopically-confirmed population. We also find an apparent dependence on both quiescent galaxy mass and environment, with $75\%$ of the most massive ($\log (M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}\geq10.75$) residing inside overdense peaks. We compare the star formation histories (SFHs) of the MQGs with the high-redshift galaxy stellar mass function from observations and simulated quiescent galaxies at $z>5$, finding that the masses from the inferred MQG SFHs regularly exceed either observed or simulated high-redshift galaxies, which suggests indicates that mergers and ex-situ star formation play a key role in the mass assembly of MQGs in overdense environments.         |

|| S. V. Jeffers, et al. -- incl., <mark>M. Kürster</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-30*|
|*Comments*| *published in A&A*|
|**Abstract**|            Context. Current exoplanet surveys are focused on detecting small exoplanets orbiting in the liquid-water habitable zones of their host stars. Despite the recent significant advancements in instrumental developments, the current limitation in detecting these exoplanets is the intrinsic variability of the host star itself. Aims. Our aim is to use the full CARMENES guaranteed time observations (GTO) data set spanning more than 8 years of observations of over 350 stars to investigate the wavelength dependence of high-precision radial velocities (RV), as stellar activity features should exhibit a wavelength dependence while the RV variation due to an orbiting planet will be wavelength independent. Methods. We use the chromatic index (CRX) to quantify the slope of the measured RVs as a function of logarithmic wavelength. We investigate the dependence of the CRX in the full CARMENES GTO sample on 24 stellar activity indices in the visible and near-infrared channels of the CARMENES spectrograph and each star's stellar parameters. We also present an updated convective turnover time scaling for the calculation of the stellar Rossby number for M dwarfs. Results. Our results show that approximately 17\% of GTO stars show a strong or a moderate correlation between CRX and RV. We can improve the measured RVs by a factor of up to nearly 4 in rms by subtracting the RV predicted by the CRX-RV correlation from the measured RVs. Mid M dwarfs with moderate rotational velocities, moderate CRX-gradients and quasi-stable activity features have the best rms improvement factors. Conclusions. We conclude that the CRX is a powerful diagnostic in mitigation of stellar activity and the search for low mass rocky planets.         |
