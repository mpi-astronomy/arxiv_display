|**Abstract**|            Here we present an automated method for obtaining wavelength calibrations for one-dimensional spectra, using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). DTW is a flexible and well-understood algorithm for pattern matching, which has not been widely used in astronomy data analysis. Employing a calibrated template spectrum as a reference, DTW can recover non-linear and even discontinuous dispersion solutions without an initial guess. The algorithm is robust against differing spectral resolution between the template and sample data, and can accommodate some spurious or missing features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DTW in an automated data reduction workflow, using both simulated and real arc lamp spectra in a Python data reduction framework. Finally, we provide a discussion on the utility and best practices with the DTW algorithm for wavelength calibration. We also introduce the PyKOSMOS data reduction toolkit, which includes our DTW calibration methods.         |

|**Abstract**|            Super-Earths and sub-Neptunes are the most common exoplanets, with a "radius valley" suggesting that super-Earths may form by shedding sub-Neptunes' gaseous envelopes. Exoplanets that lie closer to the super-Earth side of the valley are more likely to have lost a significant fraction of their original H/He envelopes and become enriched in heavier elements with CO$_2$ gaining in abundance. It remains unclear which types of haze would form in such atmospheres, potentially significantly affecting spectroscopic observations. To investigate this, we performed laboratory simulations of two CO$_2$-rich gas mixtures (with 2000 times solar metallicity at 300 K and 500 K). We found that under plasma irradiation, organic hazes were produced at both temperatures with higher haze production rate at 300 K probably because condensation occurs more readily at lower temperature. Gas-phase analysis demonstrates the formation of various hydrocarbons, oxygen- and nitrogen-containing species, including reactive gas precursors like C$_2$H$_4$, CH$_2$O, and HCN, for haze formation. The compositional analysis of the haze particles reveals various functional groups and molecular formulas in both samples. The 500 K haze sample has larger average molecular sizes, higher degree of unsaturation with more double or triple bonds presence, and higher nitrogen content incorporated as N-H, C=N bonds, indicating different haze formation pathways. These findings not only improve the haze formation theories in CO$_2$-rich exoplanet atmospheres but also offer important implications for the interpretation of future observational data.         |
