|**Abstract**|            Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxy clusters plays a key role in regulating star formation and shaping the intracluster medium (ICM), often manifesting through prominent X-ray cavities embedded in the cluster's hot atmosphere. Here we show that X-ray cavities arise naturally due to AGN feedback in TNG-Cluster. This is a new suite of magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution, and hence of galaxy clusters, whereby cold dark matter, baryon dynamics, galactic astrophysics, and magnetic fields are evolved together consistently. We construct mock Chandra X-ray observations of the central regions of the 352 simulated clusters at $z=0$ and find that $\sim$39 per cent contain X-ray cavities. Identified X-ray cavities vary in configuration (single, pairs, or multiples), with some still attached to SMBHs, while others have buoyantly risen. Their size ranges from a few to several tens of kpc. In terms of gas physical properties, TNG-Cluster X-ray cavities are underdense compared to the surrounding halo and filled with hot gas ($\sim$10$^8$K); 25 per cent of them are surrounded by an X-ray bright and compressed rim associated with a weak shock (Mach number $\sim 1.5$). Clusters exhibiting X-ray cavities are preferentially strong or weak cool-cores, are dynamically relaxed, and host SMBHs accreting at low Eddington rates. We show that TNG-Cluster X-ray cavities originate from episodic, wind-like energy injections from central AGN. Our results illustrate the existence and diversity of X-ray cavities simulated in state-of-the-art models within realistic cosmological environments and show that these can form without necessarily invoking bipolar, collimated, or relativistic jets.         |

|**Abstract**|            Over the past decade, several millimeter interferometer programs have mapped the nearby star-forming galaxy M51 at a spatial resolution of ${\le}170$ pc. This study combines observations from three major programs: the PdBI Arcsecond Whirlpool Survey (PAWS), the SMA M51 large program (SMA-PAWS), and the Surveying the Whirlpool at Arcseconds with NOEMA (SWAN). The dataset includes the (1-0) and (2-1) rotational transitions of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O isotopologues. The observations cover the $r{<}\rm 3\,kpc$ region including center and part of the disk, thereby ensuring strong detections of the weaker $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O lines. All observations are convolved in this analysis to an angular resolution of 4$''$, corresponding to a physical scale of ${\sim}$170 pc. We investigate empirical line ratio relations and quantitatively evaluate molecular gas conditions such as temperature, density, and the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_{\rm CO}$). We employ two approaches to study the molecular gas conditions: (i) assuming local thermal equilibrium (LTE) to analytically determine the CO column density and $\alpha_{\rm CO}$, and (ii) using non-LTE modeling with RADEX to fit physical conditions to observed CO isotopologue intensities. We find that the $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ values {in the center and along the inner spiral arm} are $\sim$0.5 dex (LTE) and ${\sim}$0.1 dex (non-LTE) below the Milky Way inner disk value. The average non-LTE $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ is $2.4{\pm}0.5$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$. While both methods show dispersion due to underlying assumptions, the scatter is larger for LTE-derived values. This study underscores the necessity for robust CO line modeling to accurately constrain the molecular ISM's physical and chemical conditions in nearby galaxies.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present an exploration of the Milky Way's structural parameters using an all-sky sample of RC giants to map the stellar density from the inner to the outer parts of the Galactic disc. These evolved giants are considered to be standard candles due to their low intrinsic variance in their absolute luminosities, allowing us to estimate their distances with reasonable confidence. We exploit all-sky photometry from the AllWISE mid-infrared survey and the Gaia survey, along with astrometry from Gaia Data Release 3 and recent 3D extinction maps, to develop a probabilistic scheme in order to select with high confidence \rc{}-like stars. Our curated catalogue contains about 10 million sources, for which we estimate photometric distances based on the WISE $W1$ photometry. We then derive the selection function for our sample, which is the combined selection function of sources with both \gaia{} and \allwise{} photometry. Using the distances and accounting for the full selection function of our observables, we are able to fit a two-disc, multi-parameter model to constrain the scale height (\hz{}), scale-length (\rd{}), flaring, and the relative mass ratios of the two disc components. We illustrate and verify our methodology using mock catalogues of \rc{} stars. We find that the \rc{} population is best described by a flared thin disc with scale length \rd{}=$3.56\pm0.32$ kpc and scale height at the Sun of \hzsun{}=$0.17\pm0.01$ kpc, and a shorter and thicker disc with \rd{}=$2.59\pm0.11$ kpc, \hzsun{}=$0.45\pm0.11$ kpc, with no flare. The thicker disc constitutes 64\% of the \rc{} stellar mass beyond 3 kpc, while the thin disk shows evidence of being warped beyond 9 kpc from the Galactic center. The residuals between the predicted number density of RC stars from our axisymmetric model and the measured counts show possible evidence of a two-armed spiral perturbation in the disc of the Milky Way.         |

|**Abstract**|            The innermost portions of the Milky Way's stellar halo have avoided scrutiny until recently. The lack of wide-area survey data, made it difficult to reconstruct an uninterrupted view of the density distribution of the metal-poor stars inside the Solar radius. In this study, we utilize red giant branch (RGB) stars from Gaia, with metallicities estimated using spectro-photometry from Gaia Data Release 3. Accounting for Gaia's selection function, we examine the spatial distribution of metal-poor ([M/H]<-1.3) RGB stars, from the Galactic centre (r~1 kpc) out to beyond the Solar radius (r~18 kpc). Our best-fitting single-component cored power-law model shows a vertical flattening of ~0.5 and a slope -3.4, consistent with previous studies. Motivated by the mounting evidence for two distinct stellar populations in the inner halo, we additionally test a range of two-component models. One of the components models the tidal debris from the Gaia Sausage/Enceladus merger, while the other captures the Aurora population -- stars that predate the Galactic disk formation. Our best-fit two-component model suggests that both populations contribute equally around the Solar radius, but Aurora dominates the inner halo with a steeper power-law index of -4.5, in agreement with the nitrogen-rich star distribution measured by Horta et al. (2021).         |

|**Abstract**|            For modeling the spectra of exoplanets one must know their atmospheric composition. This is necessary because the abundance of molecules, atoms, ions and condensates is needed to construct the total cross-section for the interaction between electro-magnetic radiation and matter. In addition, when solving for the temperature structure of an atmosphere the so-called adiabatic temperature gradient must be known, which describes the pressure-temperature dependence in convectively unstable regions well. Depending on the planetary properties, the composition and adiabatic gradients may be well described by equilibrium chemistry, which means that chemical reactions occur faster than any other relevant processes in the atmosphere, such as mixing. What is more, the equilibrium assumption often serves as a useful starting point for non-equilibrium calculations. Efficient and easy-to-use codes for determining equilibrium abundances are therefore needed. Here we report on our easyCHEM Python package that calculates atmospheric compositions and adiabatic temperature gradients in chemical equilibrium for any user-specified elemental composition.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report the discovery of a peculiar X-ray transient, EP240408a, by Einstein Probe (EP) and follow-up studies made with EP, Swift, NICER, GROND, ATCA and other ground-based multi-wavelength telescopes. The new transient was first detected with Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) on board EP on April 8th, 2024, manifested in an intense yet brief X-ray flare lasting for 12 seconds. The flare reached a peak flux of 3.9x10^(-9) erg/cm2/s in 0.5-4 keV, about 300 times brighter than the underlying X-ray emission detected throughout the observation. Rapid and more precise follow-up observations by EP/FXT, Swift and NICER confirmed the finding of this new transient. Its X-ray spectrum is non-thermal in 0.5-10 keV, with a power-law photon index varying within 1.8-2.5. The X-ray light curve shows a plateau lasting for about 4 days, followed by a steep decay till becoming undetectable about 10 days after the initial detection. Based on its temporal property and constraints from previous EP observations, an unusual timescale in the range of 7-23 days is found for EP240408a, which is intermediate between the commonly found fast and long-term transients. No counterparts have been found in optical and near-infrared, with the earliest observation at 17 hours after the initial X-ray detection, suggestive of intrinsically weak emission in these bands. We demonstrate that the remarkable properties of EP240408a are inconsistent with any of the transient types known so far, by comparison with, in particular, jetted tidal disruption events, gamma-ray bursts, X-ray binaries and fast blue optical transients. The nature of EP240408a thus remains an enigma. We suggest that EP240408a may represent a new type of transients with intermediate timescales of the order of about 10 days. The detection and follow-ups of more of such objects are essential for revealing their origin.         |
