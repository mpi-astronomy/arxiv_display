|**Abstract**|            Euclid will collect an enormous amount of data during the mission's lifetime, observing billions of galaxies in the extragalactic sky. Along with traditional template-fitting methods, numerous Machine Learning algorithms have been presented for computing their photometric redshifts and physical parameters (PP), requiring significantly less computing effort while producing equivalent performance measures. However, their performance is limited by the quality and amount of input information, to the point where the recovery of some well-established physical relationships between parameters might not be guaranteed. To forecast the reliability of Euclid photo-$z$s and PPs calculations, we produced two mock catalogs simulating Euclid photometry. We simulated the Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) and Euclid Deep Fields (EDF). We tested the performance of a template-fitting algorithm (Phosphoros) and four ML methods in recovering photo-$z$s, stellar masses, star-formation rates, and the SFMS. To mimic the Euclid processing as closely as possible, the models were trained with Phosphoros-recovered labels. For the EWS, we found that the best results are achieved with a Mixed Labels approach, training the models with Wide survey features and labels from the Phosphoros results on deeper photometry, i.e., with the best possible set of labels for a given photometry. This imposes a prior, helping the models to better discern cases in degenerate regions of feature space, i.e., when galaxies have similar magnitudes and colors but different redshifts and PPs, with performance metrics even better than those found with Phosphoros. We found no more than $3\%$ performance degradation using a COSMOS-like reference sample or removing $u$ band data, which will not be available until after data release DR1. The best results are obtained for the EDF, with appropriate recovery of photo-$z$, PPs, and the SFMS.         |

|**Abstract**|            The fifth Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V) Local Volume Mapper (LVM) is a wide-field integral field unit (IFU) survey that uses an array of four 160 mm fixed telescopes with siderostats to minimize the number of moving parts. Individual telescope observes the science field or calibration field independently and is synchronized with the science exposure. We developed the LVM Acquisition and Guiding Package (LVMAGP) optimized telescope control software program for LVM observations, which can simultaneously control four focusers, three K-mirrors, one fiber selector, four mounts (siderostats), and seven guide cameras. This software is built on a hierarchical architecture and the SDSS framework and provides three key sequences: autofocus, field acquisition, and autoguide. We designed and fabricated a proto-model siderostat to test the telescope pointing model and LVMAGP software. The mirrors of the proto-model were designed as an isogrid open-back type, which reduced the weight by 46% and enabled reaching thermal equilibrium quickly. Additionally, deflection due to bolting torque, self-gravity, and thermal deformation was simulated, and the maximum scatter of the pointing model induced by the tilt of optomechanics was predicted to be $4'.4$, which can be compensated for by the field acquisition sequence. We performed a real sky test of LVMAGP with the proto-model siderostat and obtained field acquisition and autoguide accuracies of $0''.38$ and $1''.5$, respectively. It met all requirements except for the autoguide specification, which will be resolved by more precise alignment among the hardware components at Las Campanas Observatory.         |

|**Abstract**|            The inferred dust masses from Class II protoplanetary disk observations are lower than or equal to the masses of the observed exoplanet systems. This poses the question of how planets form if their natal environments do not contain enough mass. This hypothesis has entered the literature as the "mass budget problem" of planet formation. We utilize numerical simulations of planet formation via pebble and gas accretion, including migration, in a viscously evolving protoplanetary disk, while tracing the time evolution of the dust mass. As expected, we find that the presence of a giant planet in the disk can influence the evolution of the disk itself and prevent rapid dust mass loss by trapping the dust outside its orbit. Early formation is crucial for giant planet formation, as we found in our previous work; therefore, our findings strengthen the hypothesis that planet formation has already occurred or is ongoing in Class II disks. Most importantly, we find that the optically thin dust mass significantly underestimates the total dust mass in the presence of a dust-trapping deep gap. We also show that the beam convolution would smear out the feature from a deep gap, especially if the planet forms in the inner disk. Such hidden dust mass, along with early planet formation, could be the answer to the hypothetical mass budget problem.         |

|**Abstract**|            JWST has discovered a large population of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at high redshift. Many of these newly discovered AGN have broad permitted lines (typically H$\alpha$), but are extremely weak in the X-rays. Here we present the NIRSpec spectrum of the most extreme of these objects, GN-28074, an AGN at $z=2.26$ with prominent Balmer, Paschen and \HeI broad lines, and with the highest limit on the bolometric to X-ray luminosity ratio among all spectroscopically confirmed AGN in GOODS. This source is also characterized by a mid-IR excess, most likely associated with the AGN torus' hot dust. The high bolometric luminosity and moderate redshift of this AGN allow us to explore its properties more in depth relative to other JWST-discovered AGN. The NIRSpec spectrum reveals prominent, slightly blueshifted absorption of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and \HeI$\lambda$10830. The Balmer absorption lines require gas with densities of $n_{\rm H}> 10^8~{\rm cm}^{-3}$, inconsistent with an ISM origin, but fully consistent with clouds in the Broad Line Region (BLR). This finding suggests that at least part of the X-ray weakness is due to high (Compton thick) X-ray absorption by (dust-free) clouds in the BLR, or in its outer, slowly outflowing regions. GN-28074 is also extremely radio-weak. The radio weakness can also be explained in terms of absorption, as the inferred density of the clouds responsible for H$\alpha$ absorption makes them optically thick to radio emission through free-free absorption. Alternatively, in this and other JWST-discovered AGN, the nuclear magnetic field may have not developed properly yet, resulting both in intrinsically weak radio emission and also lack of hot corona, hence intrinsic X-ray weakness. Finally, we show that recently proposed scenarios, invoking hyper-dense and ultra-metal-poor outflows or Raman scattering to explain the broad H$\alpha$, are completely ruled out.         |

|**Abstract**|            The recent inference of sulphur dioxide (SO$_2$) in the atmosphere of the hot ($\sim$1100 K), Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b from near-infrared JWST observations suggests that photochemistry is a key process in high temperature exoplanet atmospheres. This is due to the low ($<$1 ppb) abundance of SO$_2$ under thermochemical equilibrium, compared to that produced from the photochemistry of H$_2$O and H$_2$S (1-10 ppm). However, the SO$_2$ inference was made from a single, small molecular feature in the transmission spectrum of WASP-39b at 4.05 $\mu$m, and therefore the detection of other SO$_2$ absorption bands at different wavelengths is needed to better constrain the SO$_2$ abundance. Here we report the detection of SO$_2$ spectral features at 7.7 and 8.5 $\mu$m in the 5-12 $\mu$m transmission spectrum of WASP-39b measured by the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS). Our observations suggest an abundance of SO$_2$ of 0.5-25 ppm (1$\sigma$ range), consistent with previous findings. In addition to SO$_2$, we find broad water vapour absorption features, as well as an unexplained decrease in the transit depth at wavelengths longer than 10 $\mu$m. Fitting the spectrum with a grid of atmospheric forward models, we derive an atmospheric heavy element content (metallicity) for WASP-39b of $\sim$7.1-8.0 $\times$ solar and demonstrate that photochemistry shapes the spectra of WASP-39b across a broad wavelength range.         |

|| <mark>J. Liu</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-07-12*|
|*Comments*| *13 pages, 7 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            Coronal jets are one of the most common eruptive activities in the solar atmosphere. They are related to rich physics processes, including but not limited to magnetic reconnection, flaring, instabilities, and plasma heating. Automated identification of off-limb coronal jets has been difficult due to their abundant nature, complex appearance, and relatively small size compared to other features in the corona. In this paper, we present an automated coronal jet identification algorithm (AJIA) that utilizes true and fake jets previously detected by a laborious semi-automated jet detection algorithm (SAJIA, Liu et al. 2023) as the input of an image segmentation neural network U-NET. It is found that AJIA could achieve a much higher (0.81) detecting precision than SAJIA (0.34), meanwhile giving the possibility of whether each pixel in an input image belongs to a jet. We demonstrate that with the aid of artificial neural networks, AJIA could enable fast, accurate, and real-time coronal jet identification from SDO/AIA 304 Åobservations, which are essential in studying the collective and long-term behavior of coronal jets and their relation with the solar activity cycles.         |
