|**Abstract**| We develop a new model within which the radius-dependent transition of the galaxy inner spins with respect to the cosmic web and the variation of the transition threshold radius ($r_{\rm th}$) with galaxy mass ($M_{\rm vir}$), smoothing scale ($r_{f}$), and redshift ($z$) can be coherently explained. The key tenet of this model is that the competition between the pressure effect of the inner mass and the compression effect of the local tidal field determines which principal direction of the tidal field the inner spins are aligned with. If the former predominates, then only the tidal torques turn on, resulting in the alignments of the inner spins with the intermediate principal axes of the tidal field. Otherwise, the galaxy spins acquire a tendency to be aligned with the shortest axes of the galaxy shapes, which is in the major principal directions of the tidal field. Quantifying the two effects in terms of the mean squared densities, we make a purely analytical prediction for $r_{\rm th}(M_{\rm vir}, z, r_{f})$. Testing this model against the numerical results from a high-resolution simulation in the redshift range of $0\le z\le 3$ on the galactic mass scale of $11.8\le \log M_{\rm vir}/(h^{-1}M_{\odot})\le 12.6$ for two different cases of $r_{f}/(h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})=0.5$ and $1$, we find excellent agreements of the model predictions with the numerical results. It is also shown that this model naturally predicts the alignments between the inner spins of the present galaxies with the principal directions of the high-$z$ tidal field at the progenitors' locations. |

|**Abstract**| We report on the discovery of an Earth-sized transiting planet ($R_p=1.015\pm0.051\,R_\oplus$) in a $P=4.02$ day orbit around K2-415 (EPIC 211414619), an M5V star at 22 pc. The planet candidate was first identified by analyzing the light curve data by the K2 mission, and is here shown to exist in the most recent data from TESS. Combining the light curves with the data secured by our follow-up observations including high-resolution imaging and near infrared spectroscopy with IRD, we rule out false positive scenarios, finding a low false positive probability of $2\times 10^{-4}$. Based on IRD's radial velocities of K2-415, which were sparsely taken over three years, we obtain the planet mass of $3.0\pm 2.7\,M_\oplus$ ($M_p<7.5\,M_\oplus$ at $95\,\%$ confidence) for K2-415b. Being one of the lowest mass stars ($\approx 0.16\,M_\odot$) known to host an Earth-sized transiting planet, K2-415 will be an interesting target for further follow-up observations, including additional radial velocity monitoring and transit spectroscopy. |

|**Abstract**| We develop a novel statistical approach to identify emission features or set upper limits in high-resolution spectra in the presence of high background. The method relies on detecting differences from the background using smooth tests and using classical likelihood ratio tests to characterise known shapes like emission lines. We perform signal detection or place upper limits on line fluxes while accounting for the problem of multiple comparisons. We illustrate the method by applying it to a Chandra LETGS+HRC-S observation of symbiotic star RT Cru, successfully detecting previously known features like the Fe line emission in the 6-7 keV range and the Iridium-edge due to the mirror coating on Chandra. We search for thermal emission lines from Ne X, Fe XVII, O VIII, and O VII, but do not detect them, and place upper limits on their intensities consistent with a $\approx$1 keV plasma. We serendipitously detect a line at 16.93 $\unicode{x212B}$ that we attribute to photoionisation or a reflection component. |

|**Abstract**| The rising population of artificial satellites and associated debris in low-altitude orbits is increasing the overall brightness of the night sky, threatening ground-based astronomy as well as a diversity of stakeholders and ecosystems reliant on dark skies. We present calculations of the potentially large rise in global sky brightness from space objects, including qualitative and quantitative assessments of how professional astronomy may be affected. Debris proliferation is of special concern: since all log-decades in debris size contribute approximately the same amount of night sky radiance, debris-generating events are expected to lead to a rapid rise in night sky brightness along with serious collision risks for satellites from centimetre-sized objects. This will lead to loss of astronomical data and diminish opportunities for ground-based discoveries as faint astrophysical signals become increasingly lost in the noise. Lastly, we discuss the broader consequences of brighter skies for a range of sky constituencies, equity/inclusion and accessibility for Earth- and space-based science, and cultural sky traditions. Space and dark skies represent an intangible heritage that deserves intentional preservation and safeguarding for future generations. |

|**Abstract**| We present new upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) HI 21-cm observations of the ultra-luminous infrared galaxy IRAS 10565+2448, previously reported to show blueshifted, broad, and shallow HI absorption indicating an outflow. Our higher spatial resolution observations have localised this blueshifted outflow, which is $\sim$ 1.36 kpc southwest of the radio centre and has a blueshifted velocity of $\sim 148\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\sim 581\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$. The spatial extent and kinematic properties of the HI outflow are consistent with the previously detected cold molecular outflows in IRAS 10565+2448, suggesting that they likely have the same driving mechanism and are tracing the same outflow. By combining the multi-phase gas observations, we estimate a total outflowing mass rate of at least $140\, \rm M_\odot \,yr^{-1}$ and a total energy loss rate of at least $8.9\times10^{42}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$, where the contribution from the ionised outflow is negligible, emphasising the importance of including both cold neutral and molecular gas when quantifying the impact of outflows. We present evidence of the presence of a radio jet and argue that this may play a role in driving the observed outflows. The modest radio luminosity $L_{\rm1.4GHz}$ $\sim1.3\times10^{23}\,{\rm W\,Hz^{-1}}$ of the jet in IRAS 10565+2448 implies that the jet contribution to driving outflows should not be ignored in low radio luminosity AGN. |

|**Abstract**| The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission searches for new exoplanets. The observing strategy of TESS results in high-precision photometry of millions of stars across the sky, allowing for detailed asteroseismic studies of individual systems. In this work, we present a detailed asteroseismic analysis of the giant star HD 76920 hosting a highly eccentric giant planet ($e = 0.878$) with an orbital period of 415 days, using 5 sectors of TESS light curve that cover around 140 days of data. Solar-like oscillations in HD 76920 are detected around $52 \, \mu$Hz by TESS for the first time. By utilizing asteroseismic modeling that takes classical observational parameters and stellar oscillation frequencies as constraints, we determine improved measurements of the stellar mass ($1.22 \pm 0.11\, M_\odot$), radius ($8.68 \pm 0.34\,R_\odot$), and age ($5.2 \pm 1.4\,$Gyr). With the updated parameters of the host star, we update the semi-major axis and mass of the planet as $a=1.165 \pm 0.035$ au and $M_{\rm p}\sin{i} = 3.57 \pm 0.22\,M_{\rm Jup}$. With an orbital pericenter of $0.142 \pm 0.005$ au, we confirm that the planet is currently far away enough from the star to experience negligible tidal decay until being engulfed in the stellar envelope. We also confirm that this event will occur within about 100\,Myr, depending on the stellar model used. |

|| <mark>V. Liccardo</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-02-03*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**| The main purpose of this study is to review the Schenberg resonant antenna transfer function and to recalculate the antenna design strain sensitivity for gravitational waves. We consider the spherical antenna with six transducers in the semi dodecahedral configuration. When coupled to the antenna, the transducer-sphere system will work as a mass-spring system with three masses. The first one is the antenna effective mass for each quadrupole mode, the second one is the mass of the mechanical structure of the transducer first mechanical mode and the third one is the effective mass of the transducer membrane that makes one of the transducer microwave cavity walls. All the calculations are done for the degenerate (all the sphere quadrupole mode frequencies equal) and non-degenerate sphere cases. We have come to the conclusion that the 'ultimate' sensitivity of an advanced version of Schenberg antenna (aSchenberg) is around the standard quantum limit (although the parametric transducers used could, in principle, surpass this limit). However, this sensitivity, in the frequency range where Schenberg operates, has already been achieved by the two aLIGOs in the O3 run, therefore, the only reasonable justification for remounting the Schenberg antenna and trying to place it in the sensitivity of the standard quantum limit would be to detect gravitational waves with another physical principle, different from the one used by laser interferometers. This other physical principle would be the absorption of the gravitational wave energy by a resonant mass like Schenberg. |

|*Appeared on*| *2023-02-03*|

|**Abstract**| We present here the design, architecture, and first data release for the Solar System Notification Alert Processing System (SNAPS). SNAPS is a Solar System broker that ingests alert data from all-sky surveys. At present, we ingest data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public survey, and we will ingest data from the forthcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) when it comes online. SNAPS is an official LSST downstream broker. In this paper we present the SNAPS design goals and requirements. We describe the details of our automatic pipeline processing in which physical properties of asteroids are derived. We present SNAPShot1, our first data release, which contains 5,458,459 observations of 31,693 asteroids observed by ZTF from July, 2018, through May, 2020. By comparing a number of derived properties for this ensemble to previously published results for overlapping objects we show that our automatic processing is highly reliable. We present a short list of science results, among many that will be enabled by our SNAPS catalog: (1) we demonstrate that there are no known asteroids with very short periods and high amplitudes, which clearly indicates that in general asteroids in the size range 0.3--20 km are strengthless; (2) we find no difference in the period distributions of Jupiter Trojan asteroids, implying that the L4 and L5 cloud have different shape distributions; and (3) we highlight several individual asteroids of interest. Finally, we describe future work for SNAPS and our ability to operate at LSST scale. |

|**Abstract**| Context. Whistler waves are electromagnetic waves produced by electron-driven instabilities, that in turn can reshape the electron distributions via wave-particle interactions. In the solar wind, they are one of the main candidates for explaining the scattering of the strahl electron population into the halo at increasing radial distances from the Sun and for subsequently regulating the solar wind heat flux. However, it is unclear what type of instability dominates to drive whistlers in the solar wind. Aims. Our goal is to study whistler wave parameters in the young solar wind sampled by Parker Solar Probe (PSP). The wave normal angle (WNA) in particular is a key parameter to discriminate between the generation mechanisms of these waves. Methods. We analyze the cross-spectral matrices of magnetic fieldfluctuations measured by the Search-Coil Magnetometer (SCM) and processed by the Digital Fields Board (DFB) from the FIELDS suite during PSP's first perihelion. Results. Among the 2701 wave packets detected in the cross spectra, namely individual bins in time and frequency, most were quasi-parallel to the background magnetic field but a significant part (3%) of observed waves had oblique (> 45{\deg}) WNA. The validation analysis conducted with the time-series waveforms reveal that this percentage is a lower limit. Moreover, we find that about 64% of the whistler waves detected in the spectra are associated with at least one magnetic dip. Conclusions. We conclude that magnetic dips provides favorable conditions for the generation of whistler waves. We hypothesize that the whistlers detected in magnetic dips are locally generated by the thermal anisotropy as quasi-parallel and can gain obliqueness during their propagation. We finally discuss the implication of our results for the scattering of the strahl in the solar wind. |

|| Aikaterini Vandorou, et al. -- incl., <mark>Lisa Dang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-02-03*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted to AJ*|
|**Abstract**| We present the analysis of high resolution follow-up observations of OGLE-2016-BLG-1195 using Keck, four years after the event's peak. We find the lens system to be at $D_L = 6.87\pm 0.65$ kpc and comprised of a $M_{\rm p} = 9.91\pm 1.61\ M_{\rm Earth}$ planet, orbiting an M-dwarf, $M_{\rm L} = 0.57\pm 0.06\ M_{\odot}$, beyond the snow line, with a projected separation of $r_\perp=2.62\pm 0.28$ AU. Our results are consistent with the discovery paper, which reports values with 1-sigma uncertainties based on a single mass-distance constraint from finite source effects. However, both the discovery paper and our follow-up results disagree with the analysis of a different group that also present the planetary signal detection. The latter utilizes Spitzer photometry to measure a parallax signal. Combined with finite source effects, they claim to measure the mass and distance of the system to much greater accuracy, suggesting that it is composed of an Earth-mass planet orbiting an ultracool dwarf. Their parallax signal though is improbable since it suggests a lens star in the disk moving perpendicular to disk rotation. Moreover, parallaxes are known to be affected by systematic errors in the photometry. Therefore, we reanalyze the Spitzer photometry for this event and conclude that the parallax signal is not significantly greater than the instrumental noise, and is likely affected by systematic errors in the photometric data. The results of this paper act as a cautionary tale that conclusions of analyses that rely heavily on low signal-to-noise Spitzer photometric data, can be misleading. |

|| Vincent Tatischeff, <mark>Margarita Hernanz</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-02-03*|
|*Comments*| *8 pages, 3 figures, proceedings of the 7th Heidelberg International Symposium on High-Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy (Gamma2022) in Barcelona (Spain) on 4-8 July 2022*|
|**Abstract**| Classical and recurrent nova explosions occur on top of white dwarfs accreting H-rich matter from a companion main sequence or red giant star, in a close binary system. In the recent years, since the launch of the Fermi gamma-ray satellite by NASA in 2008, several novae have been detected by Fermi/LAT (LAT: Large Area Telescope) in high-energy (HE) gamma rays, with energies larger than 100 MeV. This emission is known to be related to the acceleration of particles in the internal and/or external shocks occurring early after the thermonuclear nova explosion. However, very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays, with energies larger than 100 GeV, produced as a consequence of nova explosions have only been discovered very recently, in the recurrent nova RS Oph, that had an outburst in August 2021. These require the acceleration of protons, and not only of electrons; this was in fact predicted theoretically - based in observations at other wavelengths - in the previous eruption of RS Oph, in 2006, but has not been confirmed observationally until now. We review the origin of the different types of gamma-ray emission in novae and highlight the relevance of the recent VHE gamma-ray emission discoveries for the nova theory, mainly in the field of the mass ejection and the associated particle (electrons and protons) acceleration processes. |
