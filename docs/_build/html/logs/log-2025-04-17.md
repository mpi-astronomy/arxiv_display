|**Abstract**|            It is established that there exists a direct link between the formation history of star cluster populations and their host galaxies, however, our lacking understanding of star cluster assembly prohibits us to make full use of their ability to trace galaxy evolution. In this work we introduce a new variation of the 2020 version of the semi-analytical galaxy formation model "L-Galaxies" that includes the formation of star clusters above 10^4 M_Sun and probes different physical assumptions that affect their evolution over cosmic time. We use properties of different galaxy components and localised star formation to determine the bound fraction of star formation in disks. After randomly sampling masses from an environmentally-dependent star cluster initial mass function, we assign to each object a half-mass radius, metallicity, and distance from the galaxy centre. We consider up to 2000 individual star clusters per galaxy and evolve their properties over time taking into account stellar evolution, two-body relaxation, tidal shocks, dynamical friction, and a re-positioning during galaxy mergers. Our simulation successfully reproduces several observational quantities, such as the empirical relationship between the absolute V -band magnitude of the brightest young star clusters and the host galaxy star formation rate, the mass function of young star clusters, or mean metallicities of the star cluster distributions versus galaxy masses. The simulation reveals great complexity in the z = 0 star cluster population resulting from differential destruction channels and origins, including in-situ populations in the disk, a major merger-induced heated component in the halo, and accreted star clusters. Model variations point out the importance of e.g. the shape of the star cluster initial mass function or the relationship between the sound speed of cold gas and the star formation rate.         |

|| U. Pylypenko, et al. |

|**Abstract**|            Microlensing events provide a unique way to detect and measure the masses of isolated, non-luminous objects, particularly dark stellar remnants. Under certain conditions, it is possible to measure the mass of these objects using photometry alone, specifically when a microlensing light curve displays a finite-source (FS) effect. This effect generally occurs in highly magnified light curves, i.e. when the source and the lens are very well aligned. In this study, we analyse Gaia Alerts and Gaia Data Release 3 datasets, identifying four moderate-to-high-magnification microlensing events without a discernible FS effect. The absence of this effect suggests a large Einstein radius, implying substantial lens masses. In each event, we constrain the FS effect and therefore establish lower limits for angular Einstein radius and lens mass. Additionally, we use the DarkLensCode software to obtain mass, distance, and brightness distribution for the lens based on the Galactic model. Our analysis established lower mass limits of $\sim 0.2$ $M_{\odot}$ for one lens and $\sim 0.3-0.5$ $M_{\odot}$ for two others. DarkLensCode analysis supports these findings, estimating lens masses in the range of$\sim 0.42-1.66$ $M_{\odot}$ and dark lens probabilities exceeding 60\%. These results strongly indicate that the lenses are stellar remnants, such as white dwarfs or neutron stars. While further investigations are required to confirm the nature of these lenses, we demonstrate a straightforward yet effective approach to identifying stellar remnant candidates.         |

|| B. R. Setterholm, et al. -- incl., <mark>S. Kraus</mark> |

|*Comments*| *25 pages, 16 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            Planets are a natural byproduct of the stellar formation process, resulting from local aggregations of material within the disks surrounding young stars. Whereas signatures of gas-giant planets at large orbital separations have been observed and successfully modeled within protoplanetary disks, the formation pathways of planets within their host star's future habitable zones remain poorly understood. Analyzing multiple nights of observations conducted over a short, two-month span with the MIRC-X and PIONIER instruments at the CHARA Array and VLTI, respectively, we uncover a highly active environment at the inner-edge of the planet formation region in the disk of HD 163296. In particular, we localize and track the motion of a disk feature near the dust-sublimation radius with a pattern speed of less than half the local Keplerian velocity, providing a potential glimpse at the planet formation process in action within the inner astronomical unit. We emphasize that this result is at the edge of what is currently possible with available optical interferometric techniques and behooves confirmation with a temporally dense followup observing campaign.         |

|| M. Vetter, et al. -- incl., <mark>R. Andrassy</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-04-17*|

|**Abstract**|            Recent three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the common-envelope interaction revealed the self-consistent formation of bipolar magnetically driven outflows launched from a toroidal structure resembling a circumbinary disk. So far, the dynamical impact of bipolar outflows on the common-envelope phase remains uncertain and we aim to quantify its importance. We illustrate the impact on common-envelope evolution by comparing two simulations -- one with magnetic fields and one without -- using the three-dimensional moving-mesh hydrodynamics code AREPO. We focus on the specific case of a $10 M_\odot$ red supergiant star with a $5 M_\odot$ black hole companion. By the end of the magnetohydrodynamic simulations (after $\sim 1220$ orbits of the core binary system), about $6.4 \%$ of the envelope mass is ejected via the bipolar outflow, contributing to angular momentum extraction from the disk structure and core binary. The resulting enhanced torques reduce the final orbital separation by about $24 \%$ compared to the hydrodynamical scenario, while the overall envelope ejection remains dominated by recombination-driven equatorial winds. We analyze field amplification and outflow launching mechanisms, confirming consistency with earlier studies: magnetic fields are amplified by shear flows, and outflows are launched by a magneto-centrifugal process, supported by local shocks and magnetic pressure gradients. These outflows originate from $\sim 1.1$ times the orbital separation. We conclude that the magnetically driven outflows and their role in the dynamical interaction are a universal aspect, and we further propose an adaptation of the $\alpha_\mathrm{CE}$-formalism by adjusting the final orbital energy with a factor of $1+ M_\mathrm{out}/\mu$, where $M_\mathrm{out}$ is the mass ejected through the outflows and $\mu$ the reduced mass of the core binary.

|| <mark>K. El-Badry</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-04-17*|
|*Comments*| *7 pages, 5 figures. Submitted to OJAp. Example usage at this https URL*|
|**Abstract**|            Gaia parallax measurements for stars with poor astrometric fits -- as evidenced by high renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) -- are often assumed to be unreliable, but the extent and nature of their biases remain poorly quantified. High RUWE is usually a consequence of binarity or higher-order multiplicity, so the parallaxes of sources with high RUWE are often of greatest astrophysical interest. Using realistic simulations of Gaia epoch astrometry, we show that the parallax uncertainties of sources with elevated RUWE are underestimated by a factor that ranges from 1 to 4 and can be robustly predicted from observables. We derive an empirical prescription to inflate reported uncertainties based on a simple analytic function of RUWE, apparent magnitude, and parallax. We validate the correction using (a) single-star solutions for Gaia sources with known orbital solutions and (b) wide binaries containing one component with elevated RUWE. The same uncertainty corrections are expected to perform well in DR4 and DR5. Our results demonstrate that Gaia parallaxes for high-RUWE sources can still yield robust distance estimates if uncertainties are appropriately inflated, enabling distance constraints for triples, binaries with periods too long or too short to be fit astrometrically, and sources blended with neighboring sources.         |

|| <mark>X. Zhang</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-04-17*|
|*Comments*| *40 pages, 16 figures, submitted version in December 2024*|
|**Abstract**|            Relativistic jets from supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei are amongst the most powerful phenomena in the universe, acting to regulate the growth of massive galaxies. Similar jets from stellar-mass black holes offer a chance to study the same phenomena on accessible observation time scales. However, such comparative studies across black hole masses and time scales remain hampered by the long-standing perception that stellar-mass black hole jets are in a less relativistic regime. We used radio interferometry observations to monitor the Galactic black hole X-ray binary 4U 1543-47 and discovered two distinct, relativistic ejections launched during a single outburst. Our measurements reveal a likely Lorentz factor of $\sim$ 8 and a minimum of 4.6 at launch with 95% confidence, demonstrating that stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries can launch jets as relativistic as those seen in active galactic nuclei.         |

|| S. Guo, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark>, <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-04-17*|

|**Abstract**|            The period, mass ratio, eccentricity, and other orbital parameters are fundamental for investigating binary star evolution. However, the number of binaries with known orbital parameters remains limited. Utilizing the LAMOST-MRS survey, we derived orbital solutions for 665 SB2 binaries by fitting the radial velocities of 1119 SB2 systems with at least six observations, employing a modified version of Thejoker optimized for SB2 binaries. To ensure the reliability of the results, four selection criteria were applied: reduced chi-square, normalized mean absolute error, maximum phase gap, and RV distribution metric. After applying these criteria, 665 reliable orbits were retained. Comparison with Kepler, TESS, and ZTF light curve data shows excellent agreement, with discrepancies in some cases attributed to shorter pulsation periods observed in light curves. Additionally, good consistency is found between our periods and those of SB1 systems in Gaia data. These orbital solutions contribute to understanding binary star evolution and the statistical properties of binary populations.         |
