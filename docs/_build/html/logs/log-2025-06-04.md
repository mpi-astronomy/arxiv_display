|**Abstract**|            Planet-forming disks around brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars (VLMS) are on average less massive and are expected to undergo faster radial solid transport than their higher mass counterparts. Spitzer had detected C$_2$H$_2$, CO$_2$ and HCN around these objects. With better sensitivity and spectral resolving power, JWST recently revealed incredibly carbon-rich spectra from such disks. A study of a larger sample of objects is necessary to understand how common such carbon-rich inner disk regions are and to put constraints on their evolution. We present and analyze MIRI observations of 10 disks around VLMS from the MIRI GTO program. This sample is diverse, with the central object ranging in mass from 0.02 to 0.14 $M_{\odot}$. They are located in three star-forming regions and a moving group (1-10 Myr). We identify molecular emission in all sources and report detection rates. We compare the molecular flux ratios between different species and to dust emission strengths. We also compare the flux ratios with the stellar and disk properties. The spectra of these VLMS disks are extremely molecular rich, and we detect the 10 $\mu$m silicate dust emission feature in 70% of the sample. We detect C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN in all of the sources and find larger hydrocarbons such as C$_4$H$_2$ and C$_6$H$_6$ in nearly all sources. Among O-bearing molecules, we find firm detections of CO$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO in 90%, 50%, and 20% of the sample, respectively. We find that the detection rates of organic molecules correlate with other organic molecules and anti-correlate with inorganic molecules. Hydrocarbon-rich sources show a weaker 10$\mu$m dust strength as well as lower disk dust mass than the oxygen-rich sources. We find potential evidence for C/O enhancement with disk age. The observed trends are consistent with models that suggest rapid inward solid material transport and grain growth.         |

|**Abstract**|            Large-format infrared detectors are at the heart of major ground and space-based astronomical instruments, and the HgCdTe HxRG is the most widely used. The Near Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) of the ESA's Euclid mission launched in July 2023 hosts 16 H2RG detectors in the focal plane. Their performance relies heavily on the effect of image persistence, which results in residual images that can remain in the detector for a long time contaminating any subsequent observations. Deriving a precise model of image persistence is challenging due to the sensitivity of this effect to observation history going back hours or even days. Nevertheless, persistence removal is a critical part of image processing because it limits the accuracy of the derived cosmological parameters. We will present the empirical model of image persistence derived from ground characterization data, adapted to the Euclid observation sequence and compared with the data obtained during the in-orbit calibrations of the satellite.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Euclid mission has the potential to understand the fundamental physical nature of late-time cosmic acceleration and, as such, of deviations from the standard cosmological model, LCDM. In this paper, we focus on model-independent methods to modify the evolution of scalar perturbations at linear scales. We consider two approaches: the first is based on the two phenomenological modified gravity (PMG) parameters, $\mu_{\rm mg}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm mg}$, which are phenomenologically connected to the clustering of matter and weak lensing, respectively; and the second is the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy and modified gravity, which we use to parameterise the braiding function, $\alpha_{\rm B}$, which defines the mixing between the metric and the dark energy field. We discuss the predictions from spectroscopic and photometric primary probes by Euclid on the cosmological parameters and a given set of additional parameters featuring the PMG and EFT models. We use the Fisher matrix method applied to spectroscopic galaxy clustering (GCsp), weak lensing (WL), photometric galaxy clustering (GCph), and cross-correlation (XC) between GCph and WL. For the modelling of photometric predictions on nonlinear scales, we use the halo model to cover two limits for the screening mechanism: the unscreened (US) case, for which the screening mechanism is not present; and the super-screened (SS) case, which assumes strong screening. We also assume scale cuts to account for our uncertainties in the modelling of nonlinear perturbation evolution. We choose a time-dependent form for $\{\mu_{\rm mg},\Sigma_{\rm mg}\}$, with two fiducial sets of values for the corresponding model parameters at the present time, $\{\bar{\mu}_0,\bar{\Sigma}_0\}$, and two forms for $\alpha_{\rm B}$, with one fiducial set of values for each of the model parameters, $\alpha_{\rm B,0}$ and $\{\alpha_{\rm B,0},m\}$.

|**Abstract**|            A deep understanding of our Galaxy desires detailed decomposition of its stellar populations via their chemical fingerprints. This requires precise stellar abundances of many elements for a large number of stars. Here we present an updated catalog of stellar labels derived from LAMOST low-resolution spectra in a physics-sensible and rigorous manner with DD-Payne, taking labels from high-resolution spectroscopy as training set. The catalog contains atmospheric parameters for 6.4 million stars released in LAMOST DR9, and abundances for 22 elements, namely, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu, for nearly 3.6 million stars with spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) higher than 20. The [Fe/H] is valid down to $\sim$-4.0, while elemental abundance ratios [X/Fe] are mostly valid for stars with [Fe/H] $\gtrsim-2.0$. Measurement errors in these labels are sensitive to and almost inversely proportional with SNR. For stars with S/N>50, we achieved a typical error of 30 K in Teff, 0.07 dex in $\log g$, $\sim0.05$ dex in abundances for most elements with atomic number smaller than Sr, and 0.1--0.2 dex for heavier elements. Homogenization to the label estimates is carried out via dedicated internal and external calibration. In particular, the non-local thermal equilibrium effect is corrected for the [Fe/H] estimates, the Teff is calibrated to the infrared flux method scale, and the $\log~g$ is validated with asteroseismic measurements. The elemental abundances are internally calibrated using wide binaries, eliminating systematic trend with effective temperature. The catalog is publicly available.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Perseus field captured by Euclid as part of its Early Release Observations provides a unique opportunity to study cluster environment ranging from outskirts to dense regions. Leveraging unprecedented optical and near-infrared depths, we investigate the stellar structure of massive disc galaxies in this field. This study focuses on outer disc profiles, including simple exponential (Type I), down- (Type II) and up-bending break (Type III) profiles, and their associated colour gradients, to trace late assembly processes across various environments. Type II profiles, though relatively rare in high dense environments, appear stabilised by internal mechanisms like bars and resonances, even within dense cluster cores. Simulations suggest that in dense environments, Type II profiles tend to evolve into Type I profiles over time. Type III profiles often exhibit small colour gradients beyond the break, hinting at older stellar populations, potentially due to radial migration or accretion events. We analyse correlations between galaxy mass, morphology, and profile types. Mass distributions show weak trends of decreasing mass from the centre to the outskirts of the Perseus cluster. Type III profiles become more prevalent, while Type I profiles decrease in lower-mass galaxies with cluster centric distance. Type I profiles dominate in spiral galaxies, while Type III profiles are more common in S0 galaxies. Type II profiles are consistently observed across all morphological types. While the limited sample size restricts statistical power, our findings shed light on the mechanisms shaping galaxy profiles in cluster environments. Future work should extend observations to the cluster outskirts to enhance statistical significance. Additionally, 3D velocity maps are needed to achieve a non-projected view of galaxy positions, offering deeper insights into spatial distribution and dynamics.         |

|**Abstract**|            WASP-121b has been established as a benchmark ultrahot Jupiter, serving as a laboratory for the atmospheric chemistry and dynamics of strongly irradiated extrasolar gas giants. Here, we present and analyze WASP-121b's transmission spectrum observed with NIRSpec G395H on board the James Webb Space Telescope and find evidence for the thermal dissociation of H$_2$O and H$_2$ on the planet's permanent dayside. Additionally, we detect SiO at a statistical significance of $5.2\sigma$ which is compatible with chemical equilibrium in the atmosphere. Constraining the abundance of SiO and abundance ratios between silicon and volatile atoms in WASP-121b's atmosphere could help discriminate between possible migration histories of the planet. The three-dimensional nature of thermal dissociation on WASP-121b's dayside and of recombination on its nightside, however, poses a challenge to constraining molecular abundances and elemental abundance ratios from the transmission spectrum. To account for this, we implemented an atmospheric model in the NEMESIS framework that splits the planet's atmosphere into dayside and nightside. A retrieval applying our atmospheric model to WASP-121b's transmission spectrum favors a higher H$_2$O abundance on the nightside than on the dayside, demonstrating the impact of hemispheric heterogeneity when attempting to constrain WASP-121b's bulk H$_2$O inventory.         |
