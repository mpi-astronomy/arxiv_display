|**Abstract**| We measure the molecular gas environment near recent ($< 100$ yr old) supernovae (SNe) using $\sim1''$ or $\leq 150$pc resolution CO (2-1) maps from the PHANGS-ALMA survey of nearby star-forming galaxies. This is arguably the first such study to approach the scales of individual massive molecular clouds ($M_{\rm mol} \gtrsim 10^{5.3}$ M$_{\odot}$). Using the Open Supernova Catalog (OSC), we identify 63 SNe within the PHANGS-ALMA footprint. We detect CO (2-1) emission near $\sim60\%$ of the sample at 150pc resolution, compared to $\sim35\%$ of map pixels with CO (2-1) emission, and up to $\sim95\%$ of the SNe at 1kpc resolution compared to $\sim80\%$ of map pixels with CO (2-1) emission. We expect the $\sim60\%$ of SNe within the same 150pc beam as a GMC will likely interact with these clouds in the future, consistent with the observation of widespread SN-molecular gas interaction in the Milky Way, while the other $\sim40\%$ of SNe without strong CO (2-1) detections will deposit their energy in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM), perhaps helping drive large-scale turbulence or galactic outflows. Broken down by type, we detect CO (2-1) emission at the sites of $\sim85\%$ of our 9 stripped-envelope SNe (SESNe), $\sim40\%$ of our 34 Type II SNe, and $\sim35\%$ of our 13 Type Ia SNe, indicating that SESNe are most closely associated with the brightest CO (2-1) emitting regions in our sample. Our results confirm that SN explosions are not restricted to only the densest gas, and instead exert feedback across a wide range of molecular gas densities. |

|**Abstract**| Ratios of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) vibrational bands are a promising tool for measuring the properties of the PAH population and their effect on star formation. The photometric bands of the MIRI and NIRCam instruments on JWST provide the opportunity to measure PAH emission features across entire galaxy disks at unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. Here we present the first results of this analysis in a sample of three nearby galaxies: NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496. Based on the variations observed in the 3.3, 7.7, and 11.3 $\mu$m features, we infer changes to the average PAH size and ionization state across the different galaxy environments. High values of F335M$_{\rm PAH}$/F1130W and low values of F1130W/F770W are measured in H II regions in all three galaxies. This suggests that these regions are populated by hotter PAHs, and/or that the PAH ionization fraction is larger. We see additional evidence of heating and/or changes in PAH size in regions with higher molecular gas content as well as increased ionization in regions with higher H$\alpha$ intensity. |

|**Abstract**| We analyze the late time evolution of 12 supernovae (SNe) occurring over the last ${\sim}$41 years, including nine Type IIP/L, two IIb, and one Ib/c, using UBVR optical data from the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) and difference imaging. We see late time (5 to 42 years) emission from nine of the eleven Type II SNe (eight Type IIP/L, one IIb). We consider radioactive decay, circumstellar medium (CSM) interactions, pulsar/engine driven emission, dust echoes, and shock perturbed binary companions as possible sources of emission. The observed emission is most naturally explained as CSM interactions with the normal stellar winds of red supergiants with mass loss rates in the range $-7.9\lesssim \log_{10}(M_\odot\text{yr}{}^{-1}) \lesssim-4.8$. We also place constraints on the presence of any shock heated binary companion to the Type Ib/c SN 2012fh and provide progenitor photometry for the Type IIb SN 2011dh, the only one of the six SNe with pre-explosion LBT observations where the SN has faded sufficiently to allow the measurement. The results are consistent with measurements from pre-explosion Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. |

|| Chuan Tian, et al. -- incl., <mark>Aritra Ghosh</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2022-12-21*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal. 35 Pages. 25 Figures*|
|**Abstract**| We present a machine-learning framework to accurately characterize morphologies of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) host galaxies within $z<1$. We first use PSFGAN to decouple host galaxy light from the central point source, then we invoke the Galaxy Morphology Network (GaMorNet) to estimate whether the host galaxy is disk-dominated, bulge-dominated, or indeterminate. Using optical images from five bands of the HSC Wide Survey, we build models independently in three redshift bins: low $(0<z<0.25)$, medium $(0.25<z<0.5)$, and high $(0.5<z<1.0)$. By first training on a large number of simulated galaxies, then fine-tuning using far fewer classified real galaxies, our framework predicts the actual morphology for $\sim$ $60\%-70\%$ host galaxies from test sets, with a classification precision of $\sim$ $80\%-95\%$, depending on redshift bin. Specifically, our models achieve disk precision of $96\%/82\%/79\%$ and bulge precision of $90\%/90\%/80\%$ (for the 3 redshift bins), at thresholds corresponding to indeterminate fractions of $30\%/43\%/42\%$. The classification precision of our models has a noticeable dependency on host galaxy radius and magnitude. No strong dependency is observed on contrast ratio. Comparing classifications of real AGNs, our models agree well with traditional 2D fitting with GALFIT. The PSFGAN+GaMorNet framework does not depend on the choice of fitting functions or galaxy-related input parameters, runs orders of magnitude faster than GALFIT, and is easily generalizable via transfer learning, making it an ideal tool for studying AGN host galaxy morphology in forthcoming large imaging survey. |

|**Abstract**| Red geysers are a specific type of quiescent galaxy, denoted by twin jets emerging from their galactic centers. These bisymmetric jets possibly inject energy and heat into the surrounding material, effectively suppressing star formation by stabilizing cool gas. In order to confirm the presence and evolutionary consequences of these jets, this paper discusses the scaling, stacking, and conversion of 21-cm HI flux data sourced from the HI-MaNGA survey into HI gas-to-stellar mass (G/S) spectra. Our samples were dominated by non-detections, or galaxies with weak HI signals, and consequently by HI upper limits. The stacking technique discussed successfully resolved emission features in both the red geyser G/S spectrum and the control sample G/S spectrum. From these stacked spectra, we find that on average, red geyser galaxies have G/S of 0.086 $\pm$ 0.011(random)+0.029(systematic), while non-red geyser galaxies of similar stellar mass have a G/S ratio of 0.039 $\pm$ 0.018(random)+0.013(systematic). Therefore, we find no statistically significant evidence that the HI content of red geysers is different from the general quiescent population. |

|**Abstract**| We present evidence of tidally-driven inspiral in the Kepler-1658 (KOI-4) system, which consists of a giant planet (1.1$R_\mathrm{J}$, 5.9$M_\mathrm{J}$) orbiting an evolved host star (2.9$R_\odot$, 1.5$M_\odot$). Using transit timing measurements from Kepler, Palomar/WIRC, and TESS, we show that the orbital period of Kepler-1658b appears to be decreasing at a rate $\dot{P} = 131_{-22}^{+20}$~ms~yr$^{-1}$, corresponding to an infall timescale $P/\dot{P}\approx2.5$~Myr. We consider other explanations for the data including line-of-sight acceleration and orbital precession, but find them to be implausible. The observed period derivative implies a tidal quality factor $Q_\star' = 2.50_{-0.62}^{+0.85}\times10^4$, in good agreement with theoretical predictions for inertial wave dissipation in subgiant stars. Additionally, while it probably cannot explain the entire inspiral rate, a small amount of planetary dissipation could naturally explain the deep optical eclipse observed for the planet via enhanced thermal emission. As the first evolved system with detected inspiral, Kepler-1658 is a new benchmark for understanding tidal physics at the end of the planetary life cycle. |

|**Abstract**| We present the first JWST observations of the $z=4.11$ luminous radio galaxy TN J1338$-$1942, obtained as part of the "Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization and Lensing Science" (PEARLS) project. Our NIRCam observations, designed to probe the key rest-frame optical continuum and emission line features at this redshift, enable resolved spectral energy distribution modelling that incorporates both a range of stellar population assumptions and radiative shock models. With an estimated stellar mass of $\log_{10}(M/\text{M}_{\odot}) \sim 10.9$, TN J1338$-$1942 is confirmed to be one of the most massive galaxies known at this epoch. Our observations also reveal extremely high equivalent-width nebular emission coincident with the luminous AGN jets that is consistent with radiative shocks surrounded by extensive recent star-formation. We estimate the total star-formation rate (SFR) could be as high as $\sim1800\,\text{M}_{\odot}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$, with the SFR that we attribute to the jet induced burst conservatively $\gtrsim500\,\text{M}_{\odot}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$. The mass-weighted age of the star-formation, $t_{\text{mass}} <4$ Myr, is consistent with the likely age of the jets responsible for the triggered activity and significantly younger than that measured in the core of the host galaxy. The extreme scale of the potential jet-triggered star-formation activity indicates the potential importance of positive AGN feedback in the earliest stages of massive galaxy formation, with our observations also illustrating the extraordinary prospects for detailed studies of high-redshift galaxies with JWST. |

|**Abstract**| We explore the relationship between mid-infrared (mid-IR) and CO rotational line emission from massive star-forming galaxies, which is one of the tightest scalings in the local universe. We assemble a large set of unresolved and moderately ($\sim 1$ kpc) spatially resolved measurements of CO (1-0) and CO (2-1) intensity, $I_{\rm CO}$, and mid-IR intensity, $I_{\rm MIR}$, at 8, 12, 22, and 24$\mu$m. The $I_{\rm CO}$ vs. $I_{\rm MIR}$ relationship is reasonably described by a power law with slopes $0.7{-}1.2$ and normalization $I_{\rm CO} \sim 1$ K km s$^{-1}$ at $I_{\rm MIR} \sim 1$ MJy sr$^{-1}$. Both the slopes and intercepts vary systematically with choice of line and band. The comparison between the relations measured for CO~(1-0) and CO (2-1) allow us to infer that $R_{21} \propto I_{\rm MIR}^{0.2}$, in good agreement with other work. The $8\mu$m and $12\mu$m bands, with strong PAH features, show steeper CO vs. mid-IR slopes than the $22\mu$m and $24\mu$m, consistent with PAH emission arising not just from CO-bright gas but also from atomic or CO-dark gas. The CO-to-mid-IR ratio correlates with global galaxy stellar mass ($M_\star$) and anti-correlates with SFR/$M_\star$. At $\sim 1$ kpc resolution, the first four PHANGS-JWST targets show CO to mid-IR relationships that are quantitatively similar to our larger literature sample, including showing the steep CO-to-mid-IR slopes for the JWST PAH-tracing bands, although we caution that these initial data have a small sample size and span a limited range of intensities. |

|**Abstract**| We use the ROGER code by de los Rios et al. to classify galaxies around a sample of X-ray clusters into five classes according to their positions in the projected phase space diagram: cluster galaxies, backsplash galaxies, recent infallers, infalling galaxies, and interlopers. To understand the effects of the cluster environment to the evolution of galaxies, we compare across the five classes: stellar mass, specific star formation rate, size, and morphology. Following the guidelines of Coenda et al., a separate analysis is carried out for red and blue galaxies. For red galaxies, cluster galaxies differ from the other classes, having a suppressed specific star formation rate, smaller sizes, and are more likely to be classified as ellipticals. Differences are smaller between the other classes, however backsplash galaxies have significantly lower specific star formation rates than early or recent infalling galaxies. For blue galaxies, we find evidence that recent infallers are smaller than infalling galaxies and interlopers, while the latter two are comparable in size. Our results provide evidence that, after a single passage, the cluster environment can diminish a galaxy's star formation, modify its morphology, and can also reduce in size blue galaxies. We find evidence that quenching occurs faster than morphological transformation from spirals to ellipticals for all classes. While quenching is evidently enhanced as soon as galaxies get into clusters, significant morphological transformations require galaxies to experience the action of the physical mechanisms of the cluster for longer timescales. |

|**Abstract**| We present the detection of 68 sources from the most sensitive radio survey in circular polarisation conducted to date. We use the second data release of the 144 MHz LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey to produce circularly-polarised maps with median 140 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ noise and resolution of 20$''$ for $\approx$27% of the northern sky (5634 deg$^{2}$). The leakage of total intensity into circular polarisation is measured to be $\approx$0.06%, and our survey is complete at flux densities $\geq1$ mJy. A detection is considered reliable when the circularly-polarised fraction exceeds 1%. We find the population of circularly-polarised sources is composed of four distinct classes: stellar systems, pulsars, active galactic nuclei, and sources unidentified in the literature. The stellar systems can be further separated into chromospherically-active stars, M dwarfs, and brown dwarfs. Based on the circularly-polarised fraction and lack of an optical counterpart, we show it is possible to infer whether the unidentified sources are likely unknown pulsars or brown dwarfs. By the completion of this survey of the northern sky, we expect to detect 300$\pm$100 circularly-polarised sources. |

|**Abstract**| We perform a ground-based near-infrared spectroscopic survey using the Keck/MOSFIRE spectrograph to target Ly$\alpha$ emission at $7.0<z<8.2$ from 61 galaxies to trace the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We cover a total effective sky area of $\sim10^\prime\times10^\prime$ in the Extended Groth Strip field of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey. From our observations, we detect Ly$\alpha$ emission at a $>$4$\sigma$ level in eight $z>7$ galaxies, which include additional members of the known $z\sim7.7$ Ly$\alpha$-emitter (LAE) cluster (Tilvi et al. 2020). With the addition of these newly-discovered $z\sim7.7$ LAEs, this is currently the largest measured LAE cluster at $z>7$. The unusually-high Ly$\alpha$ detection rate at $z\sim7.7$ in this field suggests significantly stronger Ly$\alpha$ emission from the clustered LAEs than from the rest of our targets. We estimate the ionized bubble sizes around these LAEs and conclude that the LAEs are clustered within an extended ionized structure created by overlapping ionized bubbles which allow the easier escape of Ly$\alpha$ from galaxies. It is remarkable that the brightest object in the cluster has the lowest measured redshift of the Ly$\alpha$ line, being placed in front of the other LAEs in the line-of-sight direction. This suggests that we are witnessing the enhanced IGM transmission of Ly$\alpha$ from galaxies on the rear side of an ionized area. This could be a consequence of Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer: Ly$\alpha$ close to the central velocity is substantially scattered by the IGM while Ly$\alpha$ from the rear-side galaxies is significantly redshifted to where it has a clear path. |

|**Abstract**| Soft x-ray emissions induced by solar wind ions that collide with neutral material in the solar system have been detected around planets, and were proposed as a remote probe for the solar wind interaction with the Martian exosphere. A multi-fluid three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic model is adopted to derive the global distributions of solar wind particles. Spherically symmetric exospheric H, H$_2$, He, O, and CO$_2$ density profiles and a sophisticated hybrid model that includes charge-exchange and proton/neutral excitation processes are used to study the low triplet line ratio $G=\frac{i+f}{r}$ (0.77$\pm$0.58) of O VII and total x-ray luminosity around Mars. We further calculate the emission factor $\alpha$-value with different neutrals over a wide ion abundance and velocity ranges. Our results are in good agreement with those of previous reports. The evolution of the charge stage of solar wind ions shows that sequential recombination due to charge-exchange can be negligible at the interaction region. This only appears below the altitude of 400~km. The anonymous low disk $G$ ratio can be easily explained by the collisional quenching effect at neutral densities higher than 10$^{11}$cm$^{-3}$. However, the quenching contribution is small in Mars' exosphere and only appears below 400~km. Charge-exchange with H$_2$ and N$_2$ is still the most likely reason for this low $G$-ratio. X-ray emissivity maps in collisions with different neutrals differ from each other. A clear bow shock in the collision with all the neutrals is in accordance with previous reports. The resulting total x-ray luminosity of 6.55~MW shows a better agreement with the XMM-Newton observation of 12.8$\pm$1.4~MW than that of previous predictions. |

|**Abstract**| Variable stars play a key role in understanding the Milky Way and the universe. The era of astronomical big data presents new challenges for quick identification of interesting and important variable stars. Accurately estimating the periods is the most important step to distinguish different types of variable stars. Here, we propose a new method of determining the variability periods. By combining the statistical parameters of the light curves, the colors of the variables, the window function and the GLS algorithm, the aperiodic variables are excluded and the periodic variables are divided into eclipsing binaries and NEB variables (other types of periodic variable stars other than eclipsing binaries), the periods of the two main types of variables are derived. We construct a random forest classifier based on 241,154 periodic variables from the ASAS-SN and OGLE datasets of variables. The random forest classifier is trained on 17 features, among which 11 are extracted from the light curves and 6 are from the Gaia Early DR3, ALLWISE and 2MASS catalogs. The variables are classified into 7 superclasses and 17 subclasses. In comparison with the ASAS-SN and OGLE catalogs, the classification accuracy is generally above approximately 82% and the period accuracy is 70%-99%. To further test the reliability of the new method and classifier, we compare our results with the results of Chen et al. (2020) for ZTF DR2. The classification accuracy is generally above 70%. The period accuracy of the EW and SR variables is 50% and 53%, respectively. And the period accuracy of other types of variables is 65%-98%. |

|**Abstract**| We derived position-velocity density distribution diagrams along the major (PA = 77$^{\circ}$) axis of the elliptical planetary nebula NGC 7009 with the Keck HIRES [SII] 6716/6731 \A, doublet spectral images. The average densities of the main shell and knots of NGC 7009 derived from the [SII] 6716/673 \A, fluxes integrated over the line of sight indicate a density range of $N_{\rm e}$ = $10^{3.4}$ to 10$^{3.9}$ $cm^{-3}$, while the local densities from the volume fraction resolved in radial velocities along the line of sight show a considerably large range of about 10$^{2.8}$ -- 10$^{4.7}$ $cm^{-3}$. The derived projection angle of the major axis of the main shell is about $\psi \sim$18.3($\pm$2)$^{\circ}$. Assuming that the main shell is an ellipsoidal shell with $a \simeq$16$''$ and $b \simeq 6''$, we found the range of expansion velocity, radius, and latitude of four knots and a hot bubble. The four knots at the points in symmetrical positions are roughly aligned with the same axis of expansion of latitudes $\phi \sim \pm 34.5(\pm 0.6)^{\circ}$: One pair expands at about 35 $kms^{-1}$ close to the main ellipsoidal shell, and the other expands rapidly at about 60 $kms^{-1}$ at a distance of $r \sim 16''$. In the latitude range $\phi = $65 -- 75$^{\circ}$, the hot bubble of a relatively large structure expands rapidly with a velocity of 130 -- 150 $kms^{-1}$. Four knots and hot bubble points that expand faster than the main shell appear to have been formed by two to three eruptions at a different epoch than the primary structure formation. |

|**Abstract**| We present the Cosmological Double Radio Active Galactic Nuclei (CosmoDRAGoN) project: a large suite of simulated AGN jets in cosmological environments. These environments sample the intra-cluster media of galaxy clusters that form in cosmological smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, which we then use as inputs for grid-based hydrodynamic simulations of radio jets. Initially conical jets are injected with a range of jet powers, speeds (both relativistic and non-relativistic), and opening angles; we follow their collimation and propagation on scales of tens to hundreds of kiloparsecs, and calculate spatially-resolved synthetic radio spectra in post-processing. In this paper, we present a technical overview of the project, and key early science results from six representative simulations which produce radio sources with both core- (Fanaroff-Riley Type I) and edge-brightened (Fanaroff-Riley Type II) radio morphologies. Our simulations highlight the importance of accurate representation of both jets and environments for radio morphology, radio spectra, and feedback the jets provide to their surroundings. |

|**Abstract**| Hot subdwarf stars are very important for understanding stellar evolution, stellar astrophysics, and binary star systems. Identifying more such stars can help us better understand their statistical distribution, properties, and evolution. In this paper, we present a new method to search for hot subdwarf stars in photometric data (b, y, g, r, i, z) using a machine learning algorithm, graph neural network, and Gaussian mixture model. We use a Gaussian mixture model and Markov distance to build the graph structure, and on the graph structure, we use a graph neural network to identify hot subdwarf stars from 86 084 stars, when the recall, precision, and f1 score are maximized on the original, weight and synthetic minority oversampling technique datasets. Finally, from 21 885 candidates, we selected approximately 6 000 stars that were the most similar to the hot subdwarf star. |

|**Abstract**| With the development of a series of Galaxy sky surveys in recent years, the observations increased rapidly, which makes the research of machine learning methods for galaxy image recognition a hot topic. Available automatic galaxy image recognition researches are plagued by the large differences in similarity between categories, the imbalance of data between different classes, and the discrepancy between the discrete representation of Galaxy classes and the essentially gradual changes from one morphological class to the adjacent class (DDRGC). These limitations have motivated several astronomers and machine learning experts to design projects with improved galaxy image recognition capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel learning method, ``Hierarchical Imbalanced data learning with Weighted sampling and Label smoothing" (HIWL). The HIWL consists of three key techniques respectively dealing with the above-mentioned three problems: (1) Designed a hierarchical galaxy classification model based on an efficient backbone network; (2) Utilized a weighted sampling scheme to deal with the imbalance problem; (3) Adopted a label smoothing technique to alleviate the DDRGC problem. We applied this method to galaxy photometric images from the Galaxy Zoo-The Galaxy Challenge, exploring the recognition of completely round smooth, in between smooth, cigar-shaped, edge-on and spiral. The overall classification accuracy is 96.32\%, and some superiorities of the HIWL are shown based on recall, precision, and F1-Score in comparing with some related works. In addition, we also explored the visualization of the galaxy image features and model attention to understand the foundations of the proposed scheme. |

|**Abstract**| E-TEST (Einstein Telescope Euregio-Meuse-Rhin Site and Technology) is a project recently funded by the European program Ineterreg Euregio Meuse-Rhine. This program is dedicated to innovative cross boarder activities between Belgium, The Netherlands and Germany. With a total budget of15MC and a consortium of 11 partners from the three countries, the objective of the project is twofold. Firstly, to develop an eco-friendly and non-invasive imaging of the geological conditions as well as the development of an observatory of the underground in the EMR region. Secondly, to develop technologies necessary for 3rd generation gravitational wave detectors. In particular, it is proposed to develop a prototype of large suspended cryogenic silicon mirror, isolated from seismic vibrations at low frequency. The total budget of the project is equally spread over the two activities. The first activity is not discussed at all in this report. The E-TEST prototype will have some key unique features: a silicon mirror of 100 kg, a radiative cooling strategy (non contact), a low-frequency hybrid isolation stage, cryogenic sensors and electronics, a laser and optics at 2 microns, a low thermal noise coating. |

|**Abstract**| We report on the analysis of the AstroSat dataset of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658, obtained during its 2019 outburst. We found coherent pulsations at $\sim 401$ Hz and an orbital solution consistent with previous studies. The 3-20 keV pulse profile can be well fitted with three harmonically related sinusoidal components with background-corrected fractional amplitude of $\sim 3.5 \%$, $\sim 1.2 \%$ and $\sim 0.37 \%$ for fundamental, second and third harmonic, respectively. Our energy-resolved pulse profile evolution study indicate a strong energy dependence. We also observed a soft lag in fundamental and hard lag during its harmonic. The broadband spectrum of SAX J1808.4-3658 can be well described with a combination of thermal emission component with $kT \sim 1$ keV, a thermal Comptonization ($\Gamma \sim 1.67$) from the hot corona and broad emission lines due to Fe. |

|**Abstract**| The characterization of the dynamical state of clusters is key to study their evolution, their selection, and use them as a cosmological probe. The offsets between different definitions of the center have been used to estimate the cluster disturbance. Our goal is to study the distribution of the offset between the X-ray and optical centers in clusters of galaxies. We study the offset for eROSITA clusters. We aim to connect observations to hydrodynamical simulations and N-body models. We assess the astrophysical effects affecting the displacements. We measure the offset for clusters observed in eFEDS and eRASS1. We focus on a subsample of 87 massive eFEDS clusters at low redshift. We link the observations to the offset parameter Xoff measured on dark matter halos in N-body simulations, using the hydrodynamical simulations as a bridge. eFEDS clusters show a smaller offset compared to eRASS1, because the latter contains a larger fraction of massive and disturbed structures. We measure an average offset of 76.3+30.1-27.1 kpc on the subsample of 87 eFEDS clusters. This is in agreement with the predictions from TNG and Magneticum, and the distribution of Xoff from DMO simulations. The tails of the distributions are different. Using the offset to classify relaxed and disturbed clusters, we measure a relaxed fraction of 31% in the eFEDS subsample. Finally, we find a correlation between the offset in hydrodynamical simulations and Xoff measured on their parent DMO run and calibrate a relation between them. There is good agreement between eROSITA data and simulations. Baryons cause a decrement (increment) in the low (high) offset regime compared to the Xoff distribution. The offset-Xoff relation provides an accurate prediction of the true Xoff distribution in Magneticum and TNG. It allows introducing the offsets in cosmology, marginalizing on dynamical selection effects. |

|**Abstract**| Jets may have contributed to promoting the growth of seed black holes in the early Universe, and thus observations of radio-loud high-redshift quasars are crucial to understanding the growth and evolution of the early supermassive black holes. Here we report the radio properties of an X-ray bright $z=5.5$ quasar, SRGE J170245.3+130104 (J1702+1301). Our high-resolution radio images reveal the radio counterpart at the optical position of J1702+1301, while another radio component is also detected at $\sim$23.5\arcsec\ to the southwest. Our analysis suggests that this southwest component is associated with a foreground galaxy at $z\approx 0.677$, which is mixed with J1702+1301 in low-frequency low-resolution radio images. After removing the contamination from this foreground source, we recalculated the radio loudness of J1702+1301 to be $R>$1100, consistent with those of blazars. J1702+1301 exhibits a flat radio spectrum ($\alpha = -0.17 \pm 0.05$, $S \propto \nu^\alpha$) between 0.15 and 5 GHz; above 5 GHz, it shows a rising spectrum shape, and the spectral index $\alpha^{8.2}_{4.7}$ appears to be correlated with the variation of the flux density: in burst states, $\alpha^{8.2}_{4.7}$ becomes larger. J1702+1301 displays distinct radio variability on timescales from weeks to years in the source's rest frame. These radio properties, including high radio loudness, rising spectrum, and rapid variability, tend to support it as a blazar. |

|**Abstract**| The remnant phase of a radio galaxy is characterized by the cessation of AGN activity resulting in the stoppage of jets supplying plasma to radio lobes. In this paper, we present the search and characterization of remnant candidates in 12.5 deg$^{2}$ of the {\em XMM$-$Newton} Large$-$Scale Structure (XMM$-$LSS) field by using deep radio observations at 325 MHz from the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), at 150 MHz from the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), at 1.4 GHz from the Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), and at 3 GHz from the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS). By using both morphological criteria {\viz}undetected radio core as well as spectral criteria {\viz}high spectral curvature, and ultra$-$steep spectrum, we identify 21 remnant candidates that are found to reside mostly in non$-$cluster environments, and exhibit diverse properties in terms of morphology, spectral index ($\alpha_{\rm 150}^{\rm 1400}$ in the range of $-1.71$ to $-0.75$ with a median of $-1.10$), and linear radio size (ranging from 242 kpc to 1.3 Mpc with a median of 469 kpc). Our study attempts to identify remnant candidates down to the flux density limit of 6.0 mJy at 325 MHz, and yields an upper limit on the remnant fraction ($f_{\rm rem}$) to be around 5$\%$. The observed $f_{\rm rem}$ seems consistent with the predictions of an evolutionary model assuming power law distributions of the duration of active phase and jet kinetic power with index $-0.8$ to $-1.2$. |

|**Abstract**| The standard formation theory of binary millisecond pulsars (BMSPs) predicts efficient orbital circularization due to tidal interaction during the previous mass transfer phase. Therefore, BMSPs are expected to have a circular orbit. However, the discovery of several eccentric BMSPs (eBMSPs) with a white dwarf (WD) companion has challenged this picture. In particular, recent observation reveals that the spin angular momentum of the eBMSP J0955$-$6150 is tilted at an angle $>4.8^{\rm \degree}$ from the orbital angular momentum. This is the first time that a tilt angle is deduced for eBMSPs, which provides an important clue to their formation mechanism. Both the orbital eccentricity and tilt angle could be qualitatively accounted for by asymmetrical mass ejection during thermonuclear flashes from proto-WDs (so-called the thermonuclear rocket model), but detailed studies are still lacking. In this paper, we simulate the impact of the kick caused by asymmetrical mass ejection on the properties of BMSPs. We find that the thermonuclear rocket model can potentially explain the observational characteristics of both eBMSPs and normal BMSPs under reasonable input parameters. In addition, our results predict a wide range of the orbital period (from less than one day to more than several hundred days) for eBMSPs, which can be tested by future observations. |

|**Abstract**| We study the relation between halo concentration and mass (c-M relation) using the Seventh and Eighth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR7 and DR8) galaxy catalogue. Assuming that the satellite galaxies follow the distribution of dark matter, we derive the halo concentration by fitting the satellite radial profile with a Nararro Frank and White (NFW) format. The derived c-M relation covers a wide halo mass range from $10^{11.6}$ to $10^{14.1} \rm\ M_\odot$. We confirm the anti-correlation between the halo mass and concentration as predicted in cosmological simulations. Our results are in good agreement with those derived using galaxy dynamics and gravitational lensing for halos of $10^{11.6}-10^{12.9} \rm\ M_\odot$, while they are slightly lower for halos of $10^{12.9}-10^{14.1}\rm\ M_\odot$. It is because blue satellite galaxies are less concentrated, especially in the inner regions. Instead of using all satellite galaxies, red satellites could be better tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution in galaxy groups. |

|**Abstract**| In this paper, we apply the feature-integration idea to fuse the abstract features extracted by Se-ResNet with experience features into hybrid features and input the hybrid features to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify Hot subdwarfs. Based on this idea, we construct a Se-ResNet+SVM model, including a binary classification model and a four-class classification model. The four-class classification model can further screen the hot subdwarf candidates obtained by the binary classification model. The F1 values derived by the binary and the four-class classification model on the test set are 96.17% and 95.64%, respectively. Then, we use the binary classification model to classify 333,534 nonFGK type spectra in the low-resolution spectra of LAMOST DR8 and obtain a catalog of 3,266 hot subdwarf candidates, of which 1223 are newly-determined. Subsequently, the four-class classification model further filtered the 3,266 candidates, 409 and 296 are newly-determined respectively when the thresholds were set at 0.5 and 0.9. Through manual inspection, The true number of hot subdwarfs in the three newly-determined canditates are 176, 63, and 41, the corresponding precision of the classification model in the three cases are 67.94%, 84.88%, and 87.60%, respectively. Finally, we train a Se-ResNet regression model with MAE values of 1212.65 K for Teff, 0.32 dex for log g and 0.24 for [He/H], and predict the atmospheric parameters of these 176 hot subdwarf stars. This provides a certain amount of samples to help for future studies of hot subdwarfs. |

|**Abstract**| We present a sample of 254,882 luminous red giant branch (LRGB) stars selected from the APOGEE and LAMOST surveys. By combining photometric and astrometric information from the 2MASS and Gaia surveys, the precise distances of the sample stars are determined by a supervised machine learning algorithm: the gradient boosted decision trees. To test the accuracy of the derived distances, member stars of globular clusters (GCs) and open clusters (OCs) are used. The tests by cluster member stars show a precision of about 10 per cent with negligible zero-point offsets, for the derived distances of our sample stars. The final sample covers a large volume of the Galactic disk(s) and halo of $0<R<30$ kpc and $|Z|\leqslant15$ kpc. The rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way across radius of $5\lesssim R\lesssim25$ kpc have been accurately measured with $\sim$ 54,000 stars of the thin disk population selected from the LRGB sample. The derived RC shows a weak decline along $R$ with a gradient of $-1.83\pm0.02$ $({\rm stat.}) \pm 0.07$ $({\rm sys.})$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, in excellent agreement with the results measured by previous studies. The circular velocity at the solar position, yielded by our RC, is $234.04\pm0.08$ $({\rm stat.}) \pm 1.36$ $({\rm sys.})$ km s$^{-1}$, again in great consistent with other independent determinations. From the newly constructed RC, as well as constraints from other data, we have constructed a mass model for our Galaxy, yielding a mass of the dark matter halo of $M_{\rm{200}}$ = ($8.05\pm1.15$)$\times$10$^{11} \rm{M_\odot}$ with a corresponding radius of $R_{\rm{200}}$ = $192.37\pm9.24$ kpc and a local dark matter density of $0.39\pm0.03$ GeV cm$^{-3}$. |
