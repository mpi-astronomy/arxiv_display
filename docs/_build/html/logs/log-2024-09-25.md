|**Abstract**|            Protoplanetary disks exhibit a rich variety of substructure in millimeter continuum emission, often attributed to unseen planets. As these planets carve gaps in the gas, dust particles can accumulate in the resulting pressure bumps, forming bright features in the dust continuum. We investigate the role of dust dynamics in the gap-opening process with 2D radiation hydrodynamics simulations of planet--disk interaction and a two-population dust component modeled as a pressureless fluid. We consider the opacity feedback and backreaction due to drag forces as mm grains accumulate in pressure bumps at different stages of dust growth. We find that dust dynamics can significantly affect the resulting substructure driven by the quasi-thermal-mass planet with $M_p/M_\star=10^{-4}$. Opacity feedback causes nonaxisymmetric features to become more compact in azimuth, whereas the drag-induced backreaction tends to dissolve nonaxisymmetries. For our fiducial model, this results in multiple concentric rings of dust rather than the expected vortices and corotating dust clumps found in models without dust feedback. A higher coagulation fraction disproportionately enhances the effect of dust opacity feedback, favoring the formation of crescents rather than rings. Our results suggest that turbulent diffusion is not always necessary to explain the rarity of observed nonaxisymmetric features, and that incorporating dust dynamics is vital for interpreting the observed substructure in protoplanetary disks. We also describe and test the implementation of the publicly-available dust fluid module in the PLUTO code.         |

|**Abstract**|            Relativistic magnetized jets, originating near black holes, are observed to exhibit sub-structured flows. In this study, we present synthetic synchrotron emission signatures for different lines of sight and frequencies, derived from three-dimensional relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of pc-scale AGN jets. These simulations apply different injection nozzles, injecting steady, variable, and precessing jets. Extending our previous study, here, we have developed a bridge to connect jet dynamics and particle acceleration within relativistic shocks with non-thermal radiation dominant in jets. The emission is derived from Lagrangian particles - injected into the jet and following the fluid - accelerated through diffusive shock acceleration and subsequently cooled by emitting energy via synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes. Overall, the different shocks structures lead to the formation of numerous localized emission patterns - interpreted as jet knots. These knot patterns can fade or flare, also as a consequence of merging or Doppler boosting, leading to jet variability. We find knots with high-enough pattern speed supposed to be visible as superluminal motion <~5c. Synchrotron spectra of all jets reveal double-humped structures, reflecting multiple electron populations characterized by the nature of underlying shock and their age. The precessing jet is the most powerful emitter, featuring a spectrum flatter than the steady and the variable jet. The emission, although essentially governed by the acceleration through shocks, depends on the cooling history of the particle as well. Overall, the continuous re-acceleration of electrons through shocks along the jet we found, is an essential prerequisite for observing extended jet emission over large time-scales and length-scales.         |

|**Abstract**|            We use the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and its Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) (5-28 um), to study the embedded HH 211 flow. We map a 0.95'x0.22' region, covering the full extent of the blue-shifted lobe, the central protostellar region, and a small portion of the red-shifted lobe. The jet driving source is not detected even at the longest mid-IR wavelengths. The overall morphology of the flow consists of a highly collimated jet, mostly molecular (H2, HD) with an inner atomic ([FeI], [FeII], [SI], [NiII]) structure. The jet shocks the ambient medium, producing several large bow-shocks, rich in forbidden atomic and molecular lines, and is driving an H2 molecular outflow, mostly traced by low-J, v=0 transitions. Moreover, 0-0 S(1) uncollimated emission is also detected down to 2"-3" (~650-1000 au) from the source, tracing a cold (T=200-400 K), less dense and poorly collimated molecular wind. The atomic jet ([FeII] at 26 um) is detected down to ~130 au from source, whereas the lack of H2 emission close to the source is likely due to the large visual extinction. Dust continuum-emission is detected at the terminal bow-shocks, and in the blue- and red-shifted jet, being likely dust lifted from the disk. The jet shows an onion-like structure, with layers of different size, velocity, temperature, and chemical composition. Moreover, moving from the inner jet to the outer bow-shocks, different physical, kinematic and excitation conditions for both molecular and atomic gas are observed. The jet mass-flux rate, momentum, and momentum flux of the warm H2 component are up to one order of magnitude higher than those inferred from the atomic jet component. Our findings indicate that the warm H2 component is the primary mover of the outflow, namely it is the most significant dynamical component of the jet, in contrast to jets from more evolved YSOs, where the atomic component is dominant.         |

|**Abstract**|            This study investigates the active regions of the M3.0V star G 80-21 using the observed data from the CARMENES project with synthetic spectra generated by the RH1.5D radiative transfer code. The CARMENES project aims to search for exoplanets around M dwarfs using high-resolution near-infrared and optical echelle spectrographs. By comparing the observed data and models for the chromospheric lines of H$_\alpha$ and the bluest Ca II infrared triplet line, we obtain the best-fit models for this star. The optimal fitting for the observed spectrum of G 80-21 is achieved by employing two active areas in conjunction with an inactive regions, with a calcium abundance of [Ca/H] = $-$0.4. This combination successfully fits all the observed data across varying ratios. The minor active component consistently comprises approximately 18\% of the total (ranging from 14\% to 20\%), which suggests that the minor active component is likely located in the polar regions. Meanwhile, the major active component occupies a variable proportion, ranging from 51\% to 82\%. Our method allows for the determination of the structure and size of stellar chromospheric active regions by analyzing high-resolution observed spectra.         |
