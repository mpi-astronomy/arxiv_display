|**Abstract**| The current studies of microlensing planets are limited by small number statistics. Follow-up observations of high-magnification microlensing events can efficiently form a statistical planetary sample. Since 2020, the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) and the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) global network have been conducting a follow-up program for high-magnification KMTNet events. Here, we report the detection and analysis of a microlensing planetary event, KMT-2023-BLG-1431, for which the subtle (0.05 magnitude) and short-lived (5 hours) planetary signature was characterized by the follow-up from KMTNet and LCO. A binary-lens single-source (2L1S) analysis reveals a planet/host mass ratio of $q = (0.72 \pm 0.07) \times 10^{-4}$, and the single-lens binary-source (1L2S) model is excluded by $\Delta\chi^2 = 80$. A Bayesian analysis using a Galactic model yields estimates of the host star mass of $M_{\rm host} = 0.57^{+0.33}_{-0.29}~M_\odot$, the planetary mass of $M_{\rm planet} = 13.5_{-6.8}^{+8.1}~M_{\oplus}$, and the lens distance of $D_{\rm L} = 6.9_{-1.7}^{+0.8}$ kpc. The projected planet-host separation of $a_\perp = 2.3_{-0.5}^{+0.5}$ au or $a_\perp = 3.2_{-0.8}^{+0.7}$, subject to the close/wide degeneracy. We also find that without the follow-up data, the survey-only data cannot break the degeneracy of central/resonant caustics and the degeneracy of 2L1S/1L2S models, showing the importance of follow-up observations for current microlensing surveys. |

|**Abstract**| METIS, the Mid-Infrared ELT Imager and Spectrograph, is one of the four first-generation ELT instruments scheduled to see first light in 2028. Its two main science modules are supported by an adaptive optics system featuring a pyramid sensor with 90x90 subapertures working in the H and K bands. During the PDR and FDR phases, extensive simulations were carried out to support the sensing, reconstruction, and control concept of METIS single-conjugate adaptive optics (SCAO) system. We present details on the implementation of the COMPASS-based environment used for the simulations, the metrics used for analyzing our performance expectations, an overview of the main results, and some details on special cases like non-common path aberrations (NCPA) and water vapor seeing, as well as the low-wind effect. |

|**Abstract**| Context: High-resolution spectrographs fed by adaptive optics (AO) provide a unique opportunity to characterize directly imaged exoplanets. Observations with such instruments allow us to probe the atmospheric composition, spin rotation, and radial velocity of the planet, thereby helping to reveal information on its formation and migration history. The recent upgrade of the Cryogenic High-Resolution Infrared Echelle Spectrograph (CRIRES+) at the VLT makes it a highly suitable instrument for characterizing directly imaged exoplanets. Aims: In this work, we report on observations of $\beta$ Pictoris b with CRIRES+ and use them to constrain the planets atmospheric properties and update the estimation of its spin rotation. Methods: The data were reduced using the open-source \textit{pycrires} package. We subsequently forward-modeled the stellar, planetary, and systematic contribution to the data to detect molecules in the planet's atmosphere. We also used atmospheric retrievals to provide new constraints on its atmosphere. Results: We confidently detected water and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere of $\beta$ Pictoris b and retrieved a slightly sub-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio, which is in agreement with previous results. The interpretation is hampered by our limited knowledge of the C/O ratio of the host star. We also obtained a much improved constraint on its spin rotation of $19.9 \pm 1.0$ km/s, which gives a rotation period of $8.7 \pm 0.8$ hours, assuming no obliquity. We find that there is a degeneracy between the metallicity and clouds, but this has minimal impact on the retrieved C/O, $v\sin{i}$, and radial velocity. Our results show that CRIRES+ is performing well and stands as a highly useful instrument for characterizing directly imaged planets. |

|**Abstract**| In our previous work, we derive the CR-IGIMF: a new scenario for a variable stellar initial mass function (IMF), which combines numerical results on the role played by cosmic rays in setting the thermal state of star forming gas, with the analytical approach of the integrated galaxy-wide IMF. In this work, we study the implications of this scenario for the properties of local Early-Type galaxies (ETG), as inferred from dynamical, photometric and spectroscopic studies. We implement a library of CR-IGIMF shapes in the framework of the Galaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) model. Our realization includes a derivation of synthetic spectral energy distribution for each model galaxy, allowing a direct derivation of the mass fraction in the mean IMF of low-mass stars (i.e. the dwarf-to-giant ratio - $\rm f_{dg}$) and a comparison with IMF sensitive spectral features. The predictions of the GAEA model implementing the CR-IGIMF confirm our previous findings: it correctly reproduces both the observed excess of z$\sim$0 dynamical mass (mass-to-light ratios) with respect to spectroscopic (photometric) estimates assuming a universal, MW-like, IMF, and the observed increase of [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios with stellar mass in spheroidal galaxies. Moreover, this realization reproduces the increasing trends of $\rm f_{dg}$, and IMF-sensitive line-strengths with velocity dispersion, although the predicted relations are significantly shallower than the observed ones. Our results show that the CR-IGIMF is a promising scenario that reproduces at the same time dynamical, photometric and spectroscopic indications of a varying IMF in local ETGs. The shallow relations found for spectral indices suggest that either a stronger variability as a function of galaxy properties or additional dependences (e.g. as a function of star forming gas metallicity) might be required to match the strength of the observed trends. |

|**Abstract**| We perform nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model atmosphere analyses of the three hottest hypervelocity stars (space velocities between $\approx$ 1500-2800 km s$^{-1}$) known to date, which were recently discovered spectroscopically and identified as runaways from Type Ia supernovae. The hottest of the three (J0546$+$0836, effective temperature $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 95,000 $\pm$ 15,000 K, surface gravity log g = $5.5 \pm 0.5$) has an oxygen-dominated atmosphere with a significant amount of carbon (C = $0.10 \pm 0.05$, O = $0.90 \pm 0.05$, mass fractions). Its mixed absorption+emission line spectrum exhibits photospheric absorption lines from O V and O VI as well as O III and O IV emission lines that are formed in a radiation-driven wind with a mass-loss rate of the order of $10^{-8}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Spectroscopically, J0546$+$0836 is a [WC]-PG1159 transition-type pre-white dwarf. The second object (J0927$-$6335) is a PG1159-type white dwarf with a pure absorption-line spectrum dominated by C III/C IV and O III/O IV. We find $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 60,000 $\pm$ 5000 K, log g = $7.0 \pm 0.5$, and a carbon- and oxygen-dominated atmosphere with C = $0.47 \pm 0.25$, O = $0.48 \pm 0.25$, and possibly a minute amount of helium (He = $0.05 \pm 0.05$). Comparison with post-AGB evolutionary tracks suggests a mass of $M\approx0.5$ $M_\odot$ for both objects, if such tracks can safely be applied to these stars. We find the third object (J1332$-$3541) to be a relatively massive ($M=0.89 M_\odot$) hydrogen-rich (DAO) white dwarf with $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 65,657 $\pm$ 2390 K, log g = $8.38 \pm 0.08$, and abundances H = $0.65 \pm 0.04$ and He = $0.35 \pm 0.04$. We discuss our results in the context of the "dynamically driven double-degenerate double-detonation" (D$^6$) scenario proposed for the origin of these stars. |
