|**Abstract**| Observations of CH$^+$ are used to trace the physical properties of diffuse clouds, but this requires an accurate understanding of the underlying CH$^+$ chemistry. Until this work, the most uncertain reaction in that chemistry was dissociative recombination (DR) of CH$^+$. Using an electron-ion merged-beams experiment at the Cryogenic Storage Ring, we have determined the DR rate coefficient of the CH$^+$ electronic, vibrational, and rotational ground state applicable for different diffuse cloud conditions. Our results reduce the previously unrecognized order-of-magnitude uncertainty in the CH$^+$ DR rate coefficient to $\sim \pm 20\%$ and are applicable at all temperatures relevant to diffuse clouds, ranging from quiescent gas to gas locally heated by processes such as shocks and turbulence. Based on a simple chemical network, we find that DR can be an important destruction mechanism at temperatures relevant to quiescent gas. As the temperature increases locally, DR can continue to be important up to temperatures of $ \sim 600\,\mathrm{K} $ if there is also a corresponding increase in the electron fraction of the gas. Our new CH$^+$ DR rate coefficient data will increase the reliability of future studies of diffuse cloud physical properties via CH$^+$ abundance observations. |

|**Abstract**| The Gemini North Adaptive Optics (GNAO) facility is the upcoming AO facility for Gemini North providing a state-of-the-art AO system for surveys and time domain science in the era of JWST and Rubin operations. GNAO will be optimized to feed the Gemini infrared Multi Object Spectrograph (GIRMOS). While GIRMOS is the primary science driver for defining the capabilities of GNAO, any instrument operating with an f/32 beam can be deployed using GNAO. The GNAO project includes the development of a new laser guide star facility which will consist of four side-launched laser beams supporting the two primary AO modes of GNAO: a wide-field mode providing an improved image quality over natural seeing for a 2-arcminute circular field-of-view and a narrow-field mode providing near diffraction-limited performance over a 20x20 arcsecond square field-of-view. The GNAO wide field mode will enable GIRMOS's multi-IFU configuration in which the science beam to each individual IFU will be additionally corrected using multi-object AO within GIRMOS. The GNAO narrow field mode will feed the GIRMOS tiled IFU configuration in which all IFUs are combined into a "super"-IFU in the center of the field. GNAO also includes the development of a new Real Time Controller, a new GNAO Facility System Controller and finally the development of a new AO Bench. We present in this paper an overview of the GNAO facility and provide a status update of each product. |

|**Abstract**| We report on the galaxy density environment around a high-z radio galaxy (HzRG) at z=4.72, HSC J083913.17+011308.1 (HSC J0839+0113), probed using an r-dropout Lyman break galaxy (LBG) sample from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program data. We find that HSC J0839+0113 resides in the outskirt of an overdense region identified by the r-dropout galaxies at a 4.7 sigma significance level. The projected distance between HSC J0839+0113 and the peak position of the overdense region is 0.4 physical Mpc which is shorter than the typical protocluster radius in this epoch. According to the extended Press Schechter and the light cone models, the HSC J0839+0113-hosted overdense region is expected to evolve into a halo > 10^14 Msun at z=0 with a high probability of >80 %. These findings suggest that HSC J0839+0113 is associated with a protocluster. The HSC J0839+0113 rich-system is the most overdense region of LBGs among the known protoclusters with LBGs in the same cosmic epoch. |

|**Abstract**| We present photometric and spectroscopic data of SN 2018lab, a low luminosity type II-P supernova (LLSN) with a V-band peak luminosity of $-15.1\pm0.1$ mag. SN 2018lab was discovered by the Distance Less Than 40 Mpc (DLT40) SNe survey only 0.73 days post-explosion, as determined by observations from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). TESS observations of SN 2018lab yield a densely sampled, fast-rising, early time light curve likely powered by circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction. The blue-shifted, broadened flash ionization lines in the earliest spectra ($<$2 days) of SN 2018lab provide further evidence for ejecta-CSM interaction. The early emission features in the spectra of SN 2018lab are well described by models of a red supergiant progenitor with an extended envelope and close-in CSM. As one of the few LLSNe with observed flash ionization features, SN 2018lab highlights the need for more early spectra to explain the diversity of flash feature morphology in type II SNe. |

|**Abstract**| We report on the host properties of five X-ray luminous Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) identified at $3 < z < 5$ in the first epoch of imaging from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS). Each galaxy has been imaged with the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} (\jwst) Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), which provides spatially resolved, rest-frame optical morphologies at these redshifts. We also derive stellar masses and star formation rates for each host galaxy by fitting its spectral energy distribution using a combination of galaxy and AGN templates. The AGN hosts have an average stellar mass of ${\rm log}(M_{*}/{\rm M_{\odot}} )= 11.0$, making them among the most massive galaxies detected at this redshift range in the current CEERS pointings, even after accounting for nuclear light from the AGN. We find that three of the AGN hosts have spheroidal morphologies, one is a bulge-dominated disk and one host is dominated by point-like emission. None are found to show strong morphological disturbances that might indicate a recent interaction or merger event. Notably, all four of the resolved hosts have rest-frame optical colors consistent with a quenched or post-starburst stellar population. The presence of AGN in passively evolving galaxies at $z>3$ is significant because a rapid feedback mechanism is required in most semi-analytic models and cosmological simulations to explain the growing population of massive quiescent galaxies observed at these redshifts. Our findings are in general agreement with this picture and show that AGN can continue to inject energy into these systems after their star formation is curtailed, possibly helping to maintain their quiescent state. |

|**Abstract**| James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) images of the luminous infrared (IR) galaxy VV 114 are presented. This redshift ~ 0.020 merger has a western component (VV 114W) rich in optical star clusters and an eastern component (VV 114E) hosting a luminous mid-IR nucleus hidden at UV and optical wavelengths by dust lanes. With MIRI, the VV 114E nucleus resolves primarily into bright NE and SW cores separated by 630 pc. This nucleus comprises 45% of the 15um light of VV 114, with the NE and SW cores having IR luminosities, L_ IR (8-1000um) ~ 8+/-0.8x10^10 L_sun and ~ 5+/-0.5x10^10 L_sun, respectively, and IR densities, Sigma_IR >~ 2+/-0.2x10^13 L_sun / kpc^2 and >~ 7+/-0.7x10^12 L_sun / kpc^2, respectively -- in the range of Sigma_IR for the Orion star-forming core and the nuclei of Arp 220. The NE core, previously speculated to have an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), has starburst-like mid-IR colors. In contrast, the VV 114E SW has AGN-like colors. Approximately 40 star-forming knots with L_IR ~ 0.02-5x10^10 L_sun are identified, 25% of which have no optical counterpart. Finally, diffuse emission accounts for 40-60% of the mid-IR emission. Mostly notably, filamentary Poly-cyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission stochastically excited by UV and optical photons accounts for half of the 7.7um light of VV 114. This study illustrates the ability of JWST to detect obscured compact activity and distributed PAH emission in the most extreme starburst galaxies in the local Universe. |

|**Abstract**| The transiting planet HD80606b undergoes a 1000-fold increase in insolation during its 111-day orbit due to it being highly eccentric (e=0.93). The planet's effective temperature increases from 400K to over 1400K in a few hours as it makes a rapid passage to within 0.03AU of its host star during periapsis. Spectroscopic observations during the eclipse (which is conveniently oriented a few hours before periapsis) of HD80606b with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are poised to exploit this highly variable environment to study a wide variety of atmospheric properties, including composition, chemical and dynamical timescales, and large scale atmospheric motions. Critical to planning and interpreting these observations is an accurate knowledge of the planet's orbit. We report on observations of two full-transit events: 7 February 2020 as observed by the TESS spacecraft and 7--8 December 2021 as observed with a worldwide network of small telescopes. We also report new radial velocity observations which when analyzed with a coupled model to the transits greatly improve the planet's orbital ephemeris. Our new orbit solution reduces the uncertainty in the transit and eclipse timing of the JWST era from tens of minutes to a few minutes. When combined with the planned JWST observations, this new precision may be adequate to look for non-Keplerian effects in the orbit of HD80606b. |

|**Abstract**| The Athena X-ray Integral Unit (X-IFU) is the high resolution X-ray spectrometer, studied since 2015 for flying in the mid-30s on the Athena space X-ray Observatory, a versatile observatory designed to address the Hot and Energetic Universe science theme, selected in November 2013 by the Survey Science Committee. Based on a large format array of Transition Edge Sensors (TES), it aims to provide spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy, with a spectral resolution of 2.5 eV (up to 7 keV) over an hexagonal field of view of 5 arc minutes (equivalent diameter). The X-IFU entered its System Requirement Review (SRR) in June 2022, at about the same time when ESA called for an overall X-IFU redesign (including the X-IFU cryostat and the cooling chain), due to an unanticipated cost overrun of Athena. In this paper, after illustrating the breakthrough capabilities of the X-IFU, we describe the instrument as presented at its SRR, browsing through all the subsystems and associated requirements. We then show the instrument budgets, with a particular emphasis on the anticipated budgets of some of its key performance parameters. Finally we briefly discuss on the ongoing key technology demonstration activities, the calibration and the activities foreseen in the X-IFU Instrument Science Center, and touch on communication and outreach activities, the consortium organisation, and finally on the life cycle assessment of X-IFU aiming at minimising the environmental footprint, associated with the development of the instrument. It is expected that thanks to the studies conducted so far on X-IFU, along the design-to-cost exercise requested by ESA, the X-IFU will maintain flagship capabilities in spatially resolved high resolution X-ray spectroscopy, enabling most of the original X-IFU related scientific objectives of the Athena mission to be retained (abridged). |

|**Abstract**| We investigate the impacts of neutrino cooling mechanism inside the neutron star (NS) core on the light curves of type-I X-ray bursts and X-ray superbursts. From several observations of NS thermal evolution, physical processes of fast neutrino cooling, such as the direct Urca (DU) process, are indicated. They significantly decrease the surface temperature of NSs, though the cooling effect could be suppressed by nucleon superfluidity. In the present study, focusing on the DU process and nucleon superfluidity, we investigate the effects of NS cooling on the X-ray bursts using a general-relativistic stellar-evolution code. We find that the DU process leads find the longer recurrence time and the higher peak luminosity, which could be obstructed by the neutrons superfluidity. We also apply our burst models to the comparison with {\it Clocked burster} GS 1826$-$24, and to the recurrence time of superburst triggered by carbon ignition. These effects are significant within a certain range of binary parameters and uncertainty of the NS equation of state. |

|**Abstract**| We present a detailed study of the barium star at the heart of the planetary nebula Abell 70. Time-series photometry obtained over a period of more than ten years demonstrates that the barium-contaminated companion is a rapid rotator with temporal variability due to spots. The amplitude and phasing of the photometric variability changes abruptly, however there is no evidence for a change in the rotation period (P = 2.06~d) over the course of the observations. The co-addition of 17 high-resolution spectra obtained with VLT-UVES allow us to measure the physical and chemical properties of the companion, confirming it to be a chromospherically-active, late G-type sub-giant with more than +1~dex of barium enhancement. We find no evidence of radial velocity variability in the spectra, obtained over the course of approximately 130~d with a single additional point some 8 years later, with the radial velocities of all epochs approximately $-$10 \kms{} from the previously measured systemic velocity of the nebula. This is perhaps indicative that the binary has a relatively long period (P $\gtrsim$ 2~yr) and high eccentricity ($e\gtrsim$ 0.3), and that all the observations were taken around radial velocity minimum. However, unless the binary orbital plane is not aligned with the waist of the nebula or the systemic velocity of the binary is not equal to the literature value for the nebula, this would imply an unfeasibly large mass for the nebular progenitor. |

|**Abstract**| We present a new method based on information theory to find the optimal number of bands required to measure the physical properties of galaxies with a desired accuracy. As a proof of concept, using the recently updated COSMOS catalog (COSMOS2020), we identify the most relevant wavebands for measuring the physical properties of galaxies in a Hawaii Two-0 (H20)- and UVISTA-like survey for a sample of $i<25$ AB mag galaxies. We find that with available $i$-band fluxes, $r$, $u$, IRAC/$ch2$ and $z$ bands provide most of the information regarding the redshift with importance decreasing from $r$-band to $z$-band. We also find that for the same sample, IRAC/$ch2$, $Y$, $r$ and $u$ bands are the most relevant bands in stellar mass measurements with decreasing order of importance. Investigating the inter-correlation between the bands, we train a model to predict UVISTA observations in near-IR from H20-like observations. We find that magnitudes in $YJH$ bands can be simulated/predicted with an accuracy of $1\sigma$ mag scatter $\lesssim 0.2$ for galaxies brighter than 24 AB mag in near-IR bands. One should note that these conclusions depend on the selection criteria of the sample. For any new sample of galaxies with a different selection, these results should be remeasured. Our results suggest that in the presence of a limited number of bands, a machine learning model trained over the population of observed galaxies with extensive spectral coverage outperforms template-fitting. Such a machine learning model maximally comprises the information acquired over available extensive surveys and breaks degeneracies in the parameter space of template-fitting inevitable in the presence of a few bands. |

|**Abstract**| We present detailed timing and spectral analyses of the transient X-ray pulsar RX J0209.6$-$7427 in the Small Magellanic Cloud during its 2019 giant outburst. With a better known distance than most galactic X-ray pulsars, its peak luminosity is determined to be $(1.11\pm0.06)\times 10^{39}\, \rm erg\ s^{-1}$; it is thus a {\it bonda fide} pulsating ultraluminous X-ray source (PULX). Owing to the broad energy band of \textit{Insight}-HXMT, its pulsed X-ray emission was detected from 1 keV up to the 130$-$180 keV band, which is the highest energy emission detected from any PULXs outside the Milky Way. This allows us to conclude that its main pulsed X-ray emission is from the "fan beam" of the accretion column, and its luminosity is thus intrinsic. We also estimate its magnetic field of (4.8$-$8.6)$\times10^{12}$ G or (1.7$-$2.2)$\times10^{13}$ G, from its spin evolution or transition in the accretion column structure during the outburst; we suggest that the two values of the magnetic field strength correspond to the dipole and multipole magnetic fields of the neutron star, similar to the recent discovery in the Galactic PULX Swift J0243.6+6124. Therefore, the nature of the neutron star and its ULX emission can be understood within the current theoretical frame of accreting neutron stars. This may have implications for understanding the nature of those farther away extragalactic PULXs. |

|**Abstract**| RISTRETTO is a visible high-resolution spectrograph fed by an extreme adaptive optics (XAO) system, to be proposed as a visitor instrument on ESO VLT. The main science goal of RISTRETTO is the detection and atmospheric characterization of exoplanets in reflected light, in particular the temperate rocky planet Proxima b. RISTRETTO will be able to measure albedos and detect atmospheric features in a number of exoplanets orbiting nearby stars for the first time. It will do so by combining a high-contrast AO system working at the diffraction limit of the telescope to a high-resolution spectrograph, via a 7-spaxel integral-field unit (IFU) feeding single-mode fibers. Further science cases for RISTRETTO include the study of accreting protoplanets such as PDS 70 b & c through spectrally-resolved H-alpha emission; and spatially-resolved studies of Solar System objects such as icy moons and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune. The project is in an advanced design phase for the spectrograph and IFU/fiber-link sub-systems, and a preliminary design phase for the AO front-end. Construction of the spectrograph and IFU/fiber-link will start at the end of 2022. RISTRETTO is a pathfinder instrument in view of similar developments at ESO ELT, in particular the SCAO-IFU mode of ELT-ANDES and the future ELT-PCS instrument. |

|**Abstract**| Strongly-magnetized ($B\geq10^{12}$ G) accreting neutron stars (NSs) are prime targets for studying the launching of jets by objects with a solid surface; while classical jet-launching models predict that such NSs cannot launch jets, recent observations and models argue otherwise. Transient Be/X-ray binaries (BeXRBs) are critical laboratories for probing this poorly-explored parameter space for jet formation. Here, we present the coordinated monitoring campaigns of three BeXRBs across four outbursts: giant outbursts of SAX 2103.5+4545, 1A 0535+262, and GRO J1008-57, as well as a Type-I outburst of the latter. We obtain radio detections of 1A 0535+262 during ten out of twenty observations, while the other targets remained undetected at typical limits of $20$-$50$ $\mu$Jy. The radio luminosity of 1A 0535+262 positively correlates with its evolving X-ray luminosity, and inhabits a region of the $L_X$-$L_R$ plane continuing the correlation observed previously for the BeXRB Swift J0243.6+6124. We measure a BeXRB $L_X$-$L_R$ coupling index of $\beta = 0.86 \pm 0.06$ ($L_R \propto L_X^\beta$), similar to the indices measured in NS and black hole low-mass X-ray binaries. Strikingly, the coupling's $L_R$ normalisation is $\sim 275$ and $\sim 6.2\times10^3$ times lower than in those two comparison samples, respectively. We conclude that jet emission likely dominates during the main peak of giant outbursts, but is only detectable for close-by or super-Eddington systems at current radio sensitivities. We discuss these results in the broader context of X-ray binary radio studies, concluding that our results suggest how supergiant X-ray binaries may host a currently unidentified additional radio emission mechanism. |

|**Abstract**| The ESA/NASA Solar Orbiter space mission has been successfully launched in February 2020. Onboard is the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI), which has two telescopes, a High Resolution Telescope (HRT) and the Full Disc Telescope (FDT). The instrument is designed to infer the photospheric magnetic field and line-of-sight velocity through differential imaging of the polarised light emitted by the Sun. It calculates the full Stokes vector at 6 wavelength positions at the Fe I 617.3 nm absorption line. Due to telemetry constraints, the instrument nominally processes these Stokes profiles onboard, however when telemetry is available, the raw images are downlinked and reduced on ground. Here the architecture of the on-ground pipeline for HRT is presented, which also offers additional corrections not currently available on board the instrument. The pipeline can reduce raw images to the full Stokes vector with a polarimetric sensitivity of $10^{-3}\cdot I_{c}$ or better. |

|**Abstract**| Every moment, countless meteoroids enter our atmosphere unseen. The detection and measurement of meteors offer the unique opportunity to gain insights into the composition of our solar systems' celestial bodies. Researchers, therefore, carry out a wide-area-sky-monitoring to secure 360-degree video material, saving every single entry of a meteor. Existing machine intelligence cannot accurately recognize events of meteors intersecting the earth's atmosphere due to a lack of high-quality training data publicly available. This work presents four reusable open source solutions for researchers trained on data we collected due to the lack of available labeled high-quality training data. We refer to the proposed dataset as the NightSkyUCP dataset, consisting of a balanced set of 10,000 meteor- and 10,000 non-meteor-events. Our solutions apply various machine learning techniques, namely classification, feature learning, anomaly detection, and extrapolation. For the classification task, a mean accuracy of 99.1\% is achieved. The code and data are made public at figshare with DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.16451625 |

|**Abstract**| Reconstruction of gravitational lensing effects in the CMB from current and upcoming surveys is still dominated by temperature anisotropies. Extragalactic foregrounds in temperature maps can induce significant biases in the lensing power spectrum obtained with the standard quadratic estimators. Techniques such as masking cannot remove these foregrounds fully, and the residuals can still lead to large biases if unaccounted for. In this paper, we study the "shear-only" estimator, an example of a class of geometric methods that suppress extragalactic foreground contamination while making only minimal assumptions about foreground properties. The shear-only estimator has only been formulated in the flat-sky limit and so is not easily applied to wide surveys. Here, we derive the full-sky version of the shear-only estimator and its generalisation to an $m=2$ multipole estimator that has improved performance for lensing reconstruction on smaller scales. The multipole estimator is generally not separable, and so is expensive to compute. We explore separable approximations based on a singular-value decomposition, which allow efficient evaluation of the estimator with real-space methods. Finally, we apply these estimators to simulations that include extragalactic foregrounds and verify their efficacy in suppressing foreground biases. |

|**Abstract**| The LOPES experiment was a radio interferometer built at the existing air shower array KASCADE-Grande in Karlsruhe, Germany. The last configuration of LOPES was called LOPES 3D and consisted of ten tripole antennas. Each of these antennas consisted of three crossed dipoles east-west, north-south, and vertically aligned. With this, LOPES 3D had the unique possibility to study the benefits of measurements with vertically aligned antennas in the environment of the well understood and calibrated particle detector array KASCADE-Grande. The measurements with three spatially coincident antennas allows a redundant reconstruction of the electric field vector. Several methods to exploit the redundancy were developed and tested. Furthermore, for the first time in LOPES, the background noise could be studied polarization- and direction dependent. With LOPES 3D it could be demonstrated that radio detection reaches a higher efficiency for inclined showers when including measurements with vertically aligned antennas and that the vertical component gets more important for the measurement of inclined showers. In this contribution we discuss a weighting scheme for the best combination of three redundant reconstructed electric field vectors. Furthermore, we discuss the influence of these weighting schemes on the ability to reconstruct air showers using the radio method. We show an estimate of the radio efficiency for inclined showers with focus on the benefits of measurements with vertically aligned antennas and we present the direction dependent noise in the different polarizations. |

|**Abstract**| The RISTRETTO project is aiming to build an instrument that will detect the reflected light from close-by exoplanet. It is a two stage instrument: An extreme AO system in the visible, followed by a seven spaxel single mode High resolution Spectrograph. In this paper we present the design of this spectrograph: a classical echelle spectrograph fed with single mode fibers. Standard single mode fibers have been chosen and are forming a long tilted slit in order to have the right order spacing on the detector. The instrument will be under vacuum and thermally controlled in order to make it stable. |
