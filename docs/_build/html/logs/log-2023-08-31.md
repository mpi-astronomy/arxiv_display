|**Abstract**| As stellar compositions evolve over time in the Milky Way, so will the resulting planet populations. In order to place planet formation in the context of Galactic chemical evolution, we make use of a large ($N = 5\,325$) stellar sample representing the thin and thick discs, defined chemically, and the halo, and we simulate planet formation by pebble accretion around these stars. We build a chemical model of their protoplanetary discs, taking into account the relevant chemical transitions between vapour and refractory minerals, in order to track the resulting compositions of formed planets. We find that the masses of our synthetic planets increase on average with increasing stellar metallicity [Fe/H] and that giant planets and super-Earths are most common around thin-disc ($\alpha$-poor) stars since these stars have an overall higher budget of solid particles. Giant planets are found to be very rare ($\lesssim$1\%) around thick-disc ($\alpha$-rich) stars and nearly non-existent around halo stars. This indicates that the planet population is more diverse for more metal-rich stars in the thin disc. Water-rich planets are less common around low-metallicity stars since their low metallicity prohibits efficient growth beyond the water ice line. If we allow water to oxidise iron in the protoplanetary disc, this results in decreasing core mass fractions with increasing [Fe/H]. Excluding iron oxidation from our condensation model instead results in higher core mass fractions, in better agreement with the core-mass fraction of Earth, that increase with increasing [Fe/H]. Our work demonstrates how the Galactic chemical evolution and stellar parameters, such as stellar mass and chemical composition, can shape the resulting planet population. |

|**Abstract**| We present an analysis of the detection fraction and the number counts of radio sources imaged with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) at 1.4 GHz as part of the mJIVE-20 survey. From a sample of 24,903 radio sources identified by FIRST, 4,965 are detected on VLBI-scales, giving an overall detection fraction of $19.9\pm2.9~$per cent. However, we find that the detection fraction falls from around 50 per cent at a peak surface brightness of $80~mJy~beam^{-1}$ in FIRST to around 8 per cent at the detection limit, which is likely dominated by the surface brightness sensitivity of the VLBI observations, with some contribution from a change in the radio source population. We also find that compactness at arcsec-scales is the dominant factor in determining whether a radio source is detected with VLBI, and that the median size of the VLBI-detected radio sources is 7.7 mas. After correcting for the survey completeness and effective sky area, we determine the slope of the differential number counts of VLBI-detected radio sources with flux densities $S_{\rm 1.4~GHz} > 1~mJy$ to be $\eta_{\rm VLBI} = -1.74\pm 0.02$, which is shallower than in the cases of the FIRST parent population ($\eta_{\rm FIRST} = -1.77\pm 0.02$) and for compact radio sources selected at higher frequencies ($\eta_{\rm JBF} = -2.06\pm 0.02$). From this, we find that all-sky ($3\pi~sr$) surveys with the EVN and the VLBA have the potential to detect $(7.2\pm0.9)\times10^{5}$ radio sources at mas-resolution, and that the density of compact radio sources is sufficient (5.3~deg$^{-2}$) for in-beam phase referencing with multiple sources (3.9 per primary beam) in the case of a hypothetical SKA-VLBI array. |

|| <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-08-31*|
|*Comments*| *26 pages, 8 figures, part one of a series of papers, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal*|
|**Abstract**| We propose a general principle that under the radiative-convective equilibrium, the spatial and temporal variations in a planet's surface and atmosphere tend to increase its cooling. This principle is based on Jensen's inequality and the curvature of the response functions of surface temperature and outgoing cooling flux to changes in incoming stellar flux and atmospheric opacity. We use an analytical model to demonstrate that this principle holds for various planet types: (1) on an airless planet, the mean surface temperature is lower than its equilibrium temperature; (2) on terrestrial planets with atmospheres, the inhomogeneity of incoming stellar flux and atmospheric opacity reduces the mean surface temperature; (3) on giant planets, inhomogeneously distributed stellar flux and atmospheric opacity increase the outgoing infrared flux, cooling the interior. Although the inhomogeneity of visible opacity might sometimes heat the atmosphere, the effect is generally much smaller than the inhomogeneous cooling effect of infrared opacity. Compared with the homogeneous case, the mean surface temperature on inhomogeneous terrestrial planets can decrease by more than 20\%, and the internal heat flux on giant planets can increase by over an order of magnitude. Despite simplifications in our analytical framework, the effect of stellar flux inhomogeneity appears to be robust, while further research is needed to fully understand the effects of opacity inhomogeneity in more realistic situations. This principle impacts our understanding of planetary habitability and the evolution of giant planets using low-resolution and one-dimensional frameworks that may have previously overlooked the role of inhomogeneity. |

|*Comments*| *25 pages, 11 figures, part two of a series of papers, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal*|
|**Abstract**| We generalize the theory of the inhomogeneity effect to enable comparison among different inhomogeneous planets. A metric of inhomogeneity based on the cumulative distribution function is applied to investigate the dependence of planetary cooling on previously overlooked parameters. The mean surface temperature of airless planets increases with rotational rate and surface thermal inertia, which bounds the value in the tidally locked configuration and the equilibrium temperature. Using an analytical model, we demonstrate that the internal heat flux of giant planets exhibits significant spatial variability, primarily emitted from the nightside and high-latitude regions acting as ``radiator fins." Given a horizontally uniform interior temperature in the convective zone, the outgoing internal flux increases up to several folds as the inhomogeneity of the incoming stellar flux increases. The enhancement decreases with increasing heat redistribution through planetary dynamics or rotation. The outgoing internal flux on rapidly rotating planets generally increases with planetary obliquity and orbital eccentricity. The radiative timescale and true anomaly of the vernal equinox also play significant roles. If the radiative timescale is long, the outgoing internal flux shows a slightly decreasing but nonlinear trend with obliquity. Our findings indicate that rotational and orbital states greatly influence the cooling of planets and impact the interior evolution of giant planets, particularly for tidally locked planets and planets with high eccentricity and obliquity (such as Uranus), as well as the spatial and temporal variations of their cooling fluxes. |

|**Abstract**| The interior flux of a giant planet impacts atmospheric motion, and the atmosphere dictates the interior's cooling. Here we use a non-hydrostatic general circulation model (SNAP) coupled with a multi-stream multi-scattering radiative module (HARP) to simulate the weather impacts on the heat flow of hot Jupiters. We found that the vertical heat flux is primarily transported by convection in the lower atmosphere and regulated by dynamics and radiation in the overlying ``radiation-circulation" zone. The temperature inversion occurs on the dayside and reduces the upward radiative flux. The atmospheric dynamics relay the vertical heat transport until the radiation becomes efficient in the upper atmosphere. The cooling flux increases with atmospheric drag due to increased day-night contrast and spatial inhomogeneity. The temperature dependence of the infrared opacity greatly amplifies the opacity inhomogeneity. Although atmospheric circulation could transport heat downward in a narrow region above the radiative-convective boundary, the opacity inhomogeneity effect overcomes the dynamical effect and leads to a larger overall interior cooling than the local simulations with the same interior entropy and stellar flux. The enhancement depends critically on the equilibrium temperature, drag, and atmospheric opacity. In a strong-drag atmosphere hotter than 1600 K, a significant inhomogeneity effect in three-dimensional (3D) models can boost interior cooling several-fold compared to the 1D radiative-convection equilibrium models. This study confirms the analytical argument of the inhomogeneity effect in Zhang (2023ab). It highlights the importance of using 3D atmospheric models in understanding the inflation mechanisms of hot Jupiters and giant planet evolution in general. |
