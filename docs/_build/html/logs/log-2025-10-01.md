|**Abstract**|            Shock fronts driven by active galactic nuclei in galaxy cluster cores represent a promising mechanism to heat the intracluster gas by converting kinetic energy into thermal energy through gas compression, thereby offsetting radiative cooling. Despite their potential importance, such shocks are challenging to detect, requiring deep X-ray exposures, and have only been identified in ten clusters. We present the first systematic detection and characterization of AGN-driven shocks in simulated clusters from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamic cosmological zoom-in simulations of galaxies. TNG-Cluster exhibits a rich variety of X-ray structures, including realistic populations of X-ray cavities, as well as shocks, produced by its AGN feedback model, without collimated, relativistic jets, nor cosmic rays. We produce mock Chandra observations with deep exposure times, for a sample of 100 clusters, mass-matched (M$_{500c}=1.2$ - $8.5 \times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$) to the ten observed clusters with shocks. Using observational techniques, we identify shocks through surface brightness edges fitted with broken power laws and associated density and temperature jumps. We detect 50 shocks in 30 of the 100 clusters, with ~35% hosting multiple shocks. These shocks lie within a hundred kiloparsec of the central SMBH, are weak (Mach number < 2, median ~ 1.1), and are associated with cavities in about half of the cases. Both in observations and in TNG-Cluster, shocks tend to be located at larger radii than cavities, with median offsets of 46 and 27 kpc, respectively. The observationally inferred shock powers are comparable to the cluster cooling luminosities (10$^{44-46}$ erg s$^{-1}$), suggesting that shocks in the simulation are crucial heating mechanisms. Our results indicate that shocks play a role as important as cavities in balancing cooling in cluster cores, acting isotropically and up to larger distances.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the first VLTI/GRAVITY observations at R$_\lambda \sim 4000$ of $\beta$ Pic b. These four high S/N ($\sim$20) K-band spectra conserve both the pseudo-continuum and molecular absorption patterns. We analyze them with four self-consistent forward model grids (Exo-REM, ATMO, BT-Settl, Sonora) exploring $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, log(g), metallicity, C/O, and $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio. We also upgrade our forward modeling code \texttt{\textit{ForMoSA}} to account for the data multi-modality and combine the GRAVITY epochs with published 1-5 $\mu$m photometry, low- to medium-resolution spectra (0.9-7 $\mu$m), and high-resolution echelle spectra (2.1-5.2 $\mu$m). Sonora and Exo-REM are statistically preferred. Exo-REM yields $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ $=1607.45^{+4.85}_{-6.20}$ K and log(g) $=4.46^{+0.02}_{-0.04}$ dex from GRAVITY alone, and $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ $=1502.74^{+2.32}_{-2.14}$ K and log(g) $=4.00\pm0.01$ dex when including all datasets. Archival data significantly affect the retrieved parameters. C/O remains solar ($0.552^{+0.003}_{-0.002}$) while [M/H] reaches super-solar values (0.50$\pm$0.01). We report the first tentative constraint on log($^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO) $\sim$1.12, though this remains inconclusive due to telluric residuals. Additionally, we estimate the luminosity to be log(L/L$_\odot$) $=-4.01^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$, implying a heavy-element content of up to $\sim$5% (20-80 M$_\oplus$) given the system age and dynamical mass measurements. Access to both continuum and molecular lines at K-band significantly impacts the metallicity, possibly owing to collision-induced absorption shaping the continuum. Echelle spectra do not dominate the final fit with respect to lower resolution data. Future multi-modal frameworks should include weighting schemes reflecting bandwidth and central wavelength coverage.         |

|**Abstract**|            Context: Investigating the vertical distribution of molecular content in protoplanetary disks remains difficult in most disks mildly inclined along the line of sight. In contrast, edge-on disks provide a direct (tomographic) view of the 2D molecular brightness. Aims: We study the radial and vertical molecular distribution as well as the gas temperature and density by observing the Keplerian edge-on disk surrounding the Flying Saucer, a Class II object located in Ophiuchus. Methods: We use new and archival ALMA data to perform a tomography of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, CN, HCN, CS, H$_2$CO, c-C$_3$H$_2$, N$_2$D$^+$, DCN and $^{13}$CS. We analyze molecular tomographies and model data using the radiative transfer code DiskFit. Results: We directly measure the altitude above the mid-plane for each observed species. For the first time, we unambiguously demonstrate the presence of a common molecular layer and measure its thickness: most molecules are located at the same altitude versus radius. Beyond CO, as predicted by chemical models, the CN emission traces the upper boundary of the molecular layer, whereas the deuterated species (DCN and N2D+) resides below one scale-height. Our best fits from DiskFit show that most observed transitions in the molecular layer are thermalized because their excitation temperature is the same, around 17-20 K. Conclusions: These long-integration observations clearly reveal a molecular layer predominantly located around 1-2 scale height, at a temperature above the CO freeze-out temperature. The deuterated molecules are closer to the mid-plane and N2D+ may be a good proxy for the CO snowline. Some molecules, such as CN and H2CO, are likely influenced by the disk environment, at least beyond the mm dust disk radius. The direct observation of the molecular stratification opens the door to detailed chemical modeling in this disk which appears representative of T Tauri disks.         |

|**Abstract**|            Exoplanetary systems with multiple giant planets present an opportunity to understand planet formation, migration processes, and long-term system-wide dynamical interactions. In particular, they provide constraints to distinguish between smooth disk-driven migration or more dynamically excited system evolution pathways. We report the discovery and characterization of a unique multi-planet system hosting three gas giant planets orbiting the post-main sequence star TOI-375. The innermost planet, TOI-375 b, was initially detected by the TESS mission and then confirmed with photometric follow-up observations conducted using MEarth and LCOGT, and radial velocity measurements obtained with FEROS and CHIRON. The radial velocity data revealed the presence of two additional planetary candidates, TOI-375 c and TOI-375 d. We find that TOI-375 b is a hot Jupiter with an orbital period of $9.45469 \pm 0.00002$ days, mass $0.745 \pm 0.053,M_\mathrm{J}$, radius $0.961 \pm 0.043, R_\mathrm{J}$, and eccentricity $0.087 \pm 0.042$. The outer two planets, TOI-375 c and TOI-375 d, are warm-cold and cold Jupiters with orbital periods of $115.5^{+2.0}_{-1.6}$ days and $297.9^{+28.9}_{-18.6}$ days, and minimum masses of $2.11 \pm 0.22, M_\mathrm{J}$ and $1.40 \pm 0.28, M_\mathrm{J}$, respectively. In terms of formation and overall system architecture, the physical properties of TOI-375 b are consistent with the core accretion scenario, while the current configuration of the system could be explained by both disk-driven and high-eccentricity migration scenarios. The discovery of TOI-375 as the first known system hosting three or more fully evolved gas giants, with at least one transiting planet, makes it an excellent candidate for testing formation and migration theories.         |

|**Abstract**|            Recent disk observations have revealed multiple indirect signatures of forming gas giant planets, but high-contrast imaging has rarely confirmed the presence of the suspected perturbers. Here, we exploit a unique opportunity provided by the background star AS209bkg, which shines through a wide annular gap in the AS209 disk, to perform transmission spectrophotometry and directly measure the extinction from gap material for the first time. By combining new VLT/SPHERE and JWST/NIRCam observations with archival HST data from 2005, we model the spectral energy distribution (SED) of AS209bkg over a 19-year baseline. We find that the SED and its variability are best explained by increasing extinction along the line of sight as AS209bkg approaches the gap edge in projection. The extinction is best described by a combination of ISM-like extinction component and a grey extinction component. This points to the presence of grains in the disk outer gap that are larger than in the ISM. We find that the extinction in the gap at $\lambda\sim4.0~\mu$m is $A_{4\,\mu\mathrm{m}} = 2.7^{+0.7}_{-0.7}$ mag, while at H$\alpha$ ($\lambda=0.656~\mu$m), where most searches for accretion signatures take place, the extinction could be as high as $A_\mathrm{H\alpha} = 4.2^{+0.9}_{-1.2}$ mag ($A_V=4.6^{+1.0}_{-1.3}$ mag). This suggests that even wide, deep gaps can significantly obscure emission from protoplanets, even those following a hot-start evolutionary model. Our extinction measurements help reconcile the discrepancy between ALMA-based predictions of planet-disk interactions and the non-detections from sensitive optical and near-infrared imaging campaigns.         |

|**Abstract**|            The hot gas in the outskirts of galaxy cluster-sized halos, extending around and beyond the virial radius into nearby accretion regions, remains among one of the least explored baryon components of large-scale cosmic structure. We present a stacking analysis of 680 galaxy clusters located in the western Galactic hemisphere, using data from the first two years of the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. The stacked X-ray surface brightness profile reveals a statistically significant signal extending out to 2r200m (~4.5 Mpc). The best-fit surface brightness profile is well described by a combination of terms describing orbiting and infalling gas, with a transition occurring around r200m. At this radius, the best-fit gas density is 2.5e-5 cm^-3, corresponding to a baryon overdensity of 30. By integrating the gas density profile out to r200m, we infer a gas fraction of 90% of the universal baryon fraction with the assumption of a typical halo concentration, indicating the completeness of the baryon budget within large radii. Additionally, we examine the hot gas distribution in massive clusters in the IllustrisTNG simulations from the halo center to the accretion region. This analysis reveals differences in radial gas profiles depending on whether the direction probes voids or nearby cosmic filaments. Beyond r200m, the density profile along the filament direction exceeds that along the void direction. This pattern aligns with the observed transition radius between the one-halo and two-halo terms, suggesting that r200m is the approximate radius marking the location at which cosmic filaments connect to galaxy clusters. Meanwhile, the comparisons of the gas density profile and gas fraction profile between the observation and the IllustrisTNG simulation suggest that the feedback processes in the stacking sample are more efficient than the IllustrisTNG model in distributing gas to large radii.         |

|**Abstract**|            We investigate how Milky Way-like environments influence the sizes and structural properties of low-mass galaxies by comparing satellites of Milky Way analogs from the Satellites Around Galactic Analogs (SAGA) Survey with two control samples: an environmentally agnostic population from the SAGA background (SAGAbg) sample and isolated galaxies from the SDSS NASA-Sloan Atlas. All sizes and structural parameters are measured uniformly using pysersic to ensure consistency across samples. We find the half-light sizes of SAGA satellites are systematically larger than those of isolated galaxies, with the magnitude of the offset ranging from 0.05 to 0.12 dex (10-24%) depending on the comparison sample and completeness cuts. This corresponds to physical size differences between 85-200 pc at 10^7.5 solar masses and 220-960 pc at 10^10 solar masses. This offset persists among star-forming galaxies, suggesting that environment can influence the structure of low-mass galaxies even before it impacts quenching. The intrinsic scatter in the size-mass relation is lower for SAGA satellites than isolated galaxies, and the SÃ©rsic index distributions of satellites and isolated galaxies are similar. In comparison to star-forming satellites, quenched SAGA satellites have a slightly shallower size-mass relation and rounder morphologies at low-mass, suggesting that quenching is accompanied by structural transformation and that the processes responsible differ between low- and high-mass satellites. Our results show that environmental processes can imprint measurable structural differences on satellites in Milky Way-mass halos.         |

|**Abstract**|            Although numerous dynamical techniques have been developed to estimate the total dark matter halo mass of the Milky Way, it remains poorly constrained, with typical systematic uncertainties of 0.3 dex. In this study, we apply a neural network-based approach that achieves high mass precision without several limitations that have affected past approaches; for example, we do not assume dynamical equilibrium, nor do we assume that neighboring galaxies are bound satellites. Additionally, this method works for a broad mass range, including for halos that differ significantly from the Milky Way. Our model relies solely on observable dynamical quantities, such as satellite orbits, distances to larger nearby halos, and the maximum circular velocity of the most massive satellite. In this paper, we measure the halo mass of the Milky Way to be $\log_{10} M_\mathrm{vir}/\Msun = 12.20^{+0.163}_{-0.138}$. Future studies in this series will extend this methodology to estimate the dark matter halo mass of M31, and develop new neural networks to infer additional halo properties including concentration, assembly history, and spin axis.         |

|**Abstract**|            Knowing the composition of Jupiter's atmosphere is crucial for constraining Jupiter's bulk metallicity and formation history. Yet, constraining Jupiter's atmospheric water abundance is challenging due to its potential non-uniform distribution. Here, we explicitly resolve the water hydrological cycle in Jupiter's mid-latitudes using high-resolution simulations. Falling precipitation leads to a significant large-scale depletion of water vapor beneath the lifting condensation level. A non-uniform water vapor distribution emerges in the mid-latitude simulation with a changing Coriolis parameter across latitudes and spatially uniform cooling and heating. Water abundance at the 7-bar level varies by up to a factor of ten across latitudes, from sub-solar to super-solar values. We propose that nonlinear large-scale eddies and waves tend to drift air parcels across latitudes along constant potential vorticity (PV) surfaces, thereby sustaining latitudinal dependencies in water vapor and the interplay between water distribution and large-scale dynamics. Therefore, water distribution is influenced by the vertical structure of density stratification and changing Coriolis parameter across Jupiter's mid-latitudes, as quantified by PV. Additionally, the water hydrological cycle amplifies the specific energy of air parcels through the latent heat effect, thereby slowing down vertical mixing with a latent heat flux. The horizontal gradient of water is expected to be more pronounced with a super-solar water abundance. We suggest that similar interplays between precipitating condensates, planetary rotation, and distribution of condensable species generally exist in the weather layer of fast-rotating giant planets. The ongoing Juno mission and future Uranus mission may further reveal the non-uniform distribution of condensed species and their interplay with large-scale dynamics.         |

|**Abstract**|            Fulfilling the science goals of the Simons Observatory, a state-of-the-art cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment, has required deploying tens of thousands of superconducting bolometers. Reading out data from the observatory's more than 67,000 transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors while maintaining cryogenic conditions requires an effective multiplexing scheme. The SLAC microresonator radio frequency (SMuRF) electronics have been developed to provide the warm electronics for a high-density microwave frequency multiplexing readout system, and this system has been shown to achieve multiplexing factors on the order of 1,000. SMuRF has recently been deployed to the Simons Observatory, which is located at 5,200 m on Cerro Toco in Chile's Atacama Desert. As the SMuRF system is exposed to the desert's diurnal temperature swings, resulting phase drift in RF transmission lines may introduce a systematic signal contamination. We present studies of phase drift in the room-temperature RF lines of the Simons Observatory's 6 m large-aperture telescope, which hosts the largest deployment to date of TES microwave frequency multiplexing to a single telescope. We show that these phase drifts occur on time scales which are significantly longer than sky scanning, and that their contribution to on-sky in-transition detector noise is within the readout noise budget.         |

|**Abstract**|            GRB 250702B/EP250702a is an interesting long-duration gamma-ray transient whose nature is in debate. To obtain a full picture in gamma-ray band, we implement a comprehensive targeted search of burst emission in a wide window of 30 days jointly with Insight-HXMT, GECAM and Fermi/GBM data within the ETJASMIN framework. In gamma-ray band, we find there is a 50-second precursor about 25 hours before the 4-hour main burst, which generally consists of 4 emission episodes. Remarkably, we find that the soft X-ray emission (after the main burst) decays as a power-law with start time aligning with the last episode of main emission and index of -5/3 perfectly consistent with the canonical prediction of fallback accretion. We conclude that the properties of precursor, main burst and the following soft X-ray emission strongly support the atypical collapsar Ultra-Long Gamma-Ray Burst (ULGRB) scenario rather than the Tidal Disruption Event (TDE), and all these gamma-ray and soft X-ray emission probably originate from relativistic jet whose luminosity is dominated by the fallback accretion rate during the death collapse of a supergiant star.         |
