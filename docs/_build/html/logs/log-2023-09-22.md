|**Abstract**| We present a framework to study regolith segregation on rubble-pile asteroids (self-gravitating granular aggregates) due to seismic shaking induced by impacts sustained during their lifetimes. We first relate the amplitude and frequency of surface vibrations to the location and severity of an impact, and the rubble body's geometry and bulk properties. For clarity, the body is taken to be an ellipsoid with size and spin close to that of Itokawa, although other asteroids are also easily incorporated. We then model the body's collisional history stochastically given the variability in the impact activity on an asteroid. Finally, we utilize discrete element simulations to investigate the regolith's response to impacts. In these simulations, in any sample collisional history, every time an impact occurs, a bin filled with a grain mixture and located at the region of interest on the asteroid is vibrated at that impact's associated amplitude and frequency. Utilizing this framework we find that impact-driven seismicity is sufficient to drive size segregation on small rubble-piles, but the segregation quality depends on several aspects, e.g. total impact energy supplied, placement of the region of interest, bulk wave speed, and seismic diffusivity. |

|**Abstract**| The 2.5-generation (2.5G) ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors LIGO Voyager and Neutron Star Extreme Matter Observatory (NEMO) are expected to be operational in the late 2020s and early 2030s. In this work, we explore the potential of GW standard sirens observed by the 2.5G GW detectors in measuring cosmological parameters, especially for the Hubble constant. We consider the optimistic scenario in which short $\gamma$-ray bursts (SGRBs) from BNS mergers could be detected by the THESEUS-like GRB detector. Then we predict the number of joint GW-SGRB events based on the 10-year observation and use the mock bright siren data to perform the cosmological analysis. Our results show that LIGO Voyager and NEMO alone could measure the Hubble constant to precisions of $1.43\%$ and $1.07\%$, respectively, close to the standard of precision cosmology. Moreover, the bright sirens from 2.5G detectors could effectively break the cosmological parameter degeneracies generated by the CMB data. When combined with CMB, the constraint precision of dark-energy equation of state $w$ could achieve $3.31\%$, which is comparable with the constraint results of the latest CMB+SN data. In the conservative scenario in which electromagnetic counterparts are not available, due to the limit of the detector's sensitivity, we only consider the observation of LIGO Voyager. The constraint precision of the Hubble constant could reach $1.98\%$. When combining the mock bright and dark siren data of LIGO Voyager, the constraint precision of the Hubble constant could reach $1.06\%$, rather close to the standard of precision cosmology. We conclude that the magnificent prospect for solving the Hubble tension is worth expecting in the era of the 2.5G ground-based GW detectors. |
