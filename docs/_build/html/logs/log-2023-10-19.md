|**Abstract**| The inner hundred parsecs of the Milky Way hosts the nearest supermassive black hole, largest reservoir of dense gas, greatest stellar density, hundreds of massive main and post main sequence stars, and the highest volume density of supernovae in the Galaxy. As the nearest environment in which it is possible to simultaneously observe many of the extreme processes shaping the Universe, it is one of the most well-studied regions in astrophysics. Due to its proximity, we can study the center of our Galaxy on scales down to a few hundred AU, a hundred times better than in similar Local Group galaxies and thousands of times better than in the nearest active galaxies. The Galactic Center (GC) is therefore of outstanding astrophysical interest. However, in spite of intense observational work over the past decades, there are still fundamental things unknown about the GC. JWST has the unique capability to provide us with the necessary, game-changing data. In this White Paper, we advocate for a JWST NIRCam survey that aims at solving central questions, that we have identified as a community: i) the 3D structure and kinematics of gas and stars; ii) ancient star formation and its relation with the overall history of the Milky Way, as well as recent star formation and its implications for the overall energetics of our galaxy's nucleus; and iii) the (non-)universality of star formation and the stellar initial mass function. We advocate for a large-area, multi-epoch, multi-wavelength NIRCam survey of the inner 100\,pc of the Galaxy in the form of a Treasury GO JWST Large Program that is open to the community. We describe how this survey will derive the physical and kinematic properties of ~10,000,000 stars, how this will solve the key unknowns and provide a valuable resource for the community with long-lasting legacy value. |

|| A. Richard-Laferri√®re, et al. -- incl., <mark>U. Chadayammuri</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-10-19*|
|*Comments*| *10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**| The cluster of galaxies Abell 2146 is undergoing a major merger and is an ideal cluster to study ICM physics, as it has a simple geometry with the merger axis in the plane of the sky, its distance allows us to resolve features across the relevant scales and its temperature lies within Chandra's sensitivity. Gas from the cool core of the subcluster has been partially stripped into a tail of gas, which gives a unique opportunity to look at the survival of such gas and determine the rate of conduction in the ICM. We use deep 2.4 Ms Chandra observations of Abell 2146 to produce a high spatial resolution map of the temperature structure along a plume in the ram-pressure stripped tail, described by a partial cone, which is distinguishable from the hot ambient gas. Previous studies of conduction in the ICM typically rely on estimates of the survival time for key structures, such as cold fronts. Here we use detailed hydrodynamical simulations of Abell 2146 to determine the flow velocities along the stripped plume and measure the timescale of the temperature increase along its length. We find that conduction must be highly suppressed by multiple orders of magnitude compared to the Spitzer rate, as the energy used is about 1% of the energy available. We discuss magnetic draping around the core as a possible mechanism for suppressing conduction. |

|| K. B. Webber, et al. -- incl., <mark>M. Smith</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-10-19*|
|*Comments*| *15 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables, accepted to ApJ*|
|**Abstract**| We present a detailed chemical abundance analysis of the brightest star in the ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy candidate Cetus II from high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectra. For this star, DES J011740.53-173053, abundances or upper limits of 18 elements from Carbon to Europium are derived. Its chemical abundances generally follow those of other UFD galaxy stars, with a slight enhancement of the alpha-elements (Mg, Si, and Ca) and low neutron-capture element (Sr, Ba, Eu) abundances supporting the classification of Cetus II as a likely UFD. The star exhibits lower Sc, Ti, and V abundances than Milky Way (MW) halo stars with similar metallicity. This signature is consistent with yields from a supernova (SN) originating from a star with a mass of ~11.2 solar masses. In addition, the star has a Potassium abundance of [K/Fe] = 0.81 which is somewhat higher than the K abundances of MW halo stars with similar metallicity, a signature which is also present in a number of UFD galaxies. A comparison including globular clusters (GC) and stellar stream stars suggests that high K is a specific characteristic for some UFD galaxy stars and can thus be used to help classify objects as UFD galaxies. |
