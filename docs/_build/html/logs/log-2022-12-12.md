|**Abstract**| JWST is discovering star forming `candidate' galaxies with photometric redshifts $z>9$ and little attenuation. We model presumptive massive black holes (MBHs) in such galaxies and find that their unobscured emission is fainter than the galaxy starlight in JWST filters, and difficult to be detected via color-color selection, and X-ray and radio observations. Only MBHs overmassive relative to expected galaxy scaling relations, accreting at high Eddington rates, would be detectable. Their discovery would point to the presence of heavy MBH seeds, but care is needed to exclude the existence of lighter seeds as only overmassive MBHs are detectable in this type of galaxies. Conversely, if no overmassive MBHs are hosted in these galaxies, either there are no heavy seeds or they are rare. The most massive/highest redshift candidate galaxies can attain stellar masses in excess of 5e10 Msun by z~6 if they grow along the SFR-mass sequence, and can nurse a MBH growing from ~1e5 Msun up to >3e7 Msun by z~6, to become hosts of some z>6 quasars. Candidate galaxies of log(M_{gal}/Msun)~8 can not grow their putative seeds fast, unless seeds are >1e6 Msun. The number density of the JWST candidate galaxies far outnumbers that of the highest-z quasar hosts and this allows for about only 1 high-redshift quasar every 1000 of these galaxies. |

|**Abstract**| The standard approach to inference from cosmic large-scale structure data employs summary statistics that are compared to analytic models in a Gaussian likelihood with pre-computed covariance. To overcome the idealising assumptions about the form of the likelihood and the complexity of the data inherent to the standard approach, we investigate simulation-based inference (SBI), which learns the likelihood as a probability density parameterised by a neural network. We construct suites of simulated, exactly Gaussian-distributed data vectors for the most recent Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) weak gravitational lensing analysis and demonstrate that SBI recovers the full 12-dimensional KiDS posterior distribution with just under $10^4$ simulations. We optimise the simulation strategy by initially covering the parameter space by a hypercube, followed by batches of actively learnt additional points. The data compression in our SBI implementation is robust to suboptimal choices of fiducial parameter values and of data covariance. Together with a fast simulator, SBI is therefore a competitive and more versatile alternative to standard inference. |

|**Abstract**| We use the large-scale structure galaxy data (LSS) from the BOSS and eBOSS surveys, in combination with abundances information from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) to measure two values of the Hubble expansion rate, $H_0=100h\,[{\rm km}\, {\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}]$, each of them based on very different physical processes. One is a (traditional) late-time-background measurement based on determining the BAO scale and using BBN abundances on baryons for calibrating its absolute size (BAO+BBN). This method anchors $H_0$ to the (standard) physics of the sound horizon scale at pre-recombination times. The other is a newer early-time based measurement associated with the broadband shape of the power spectrum. This second method anchors $H_0$ to the physics of the matter-radiation equality scale, which also needs BBN information for determining the suppression of baryons in the power spectrum shape (shape+BBN). Within the $\Lambda$CDM model, we find very good consistency among these two $H_0$'s: BAO+BBN (+growth) delivers $H_0=67.42_{-0.94}^{+0.88}$ $(67.37_{-0.95}^{+0.86})$ km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$ , whereas the shape+BBN (+growth) delivers $H_0 = 70.1_{-2.1}^{+2.1}$ $(70.1_{-2.1}^{+1.9})$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, where "growth" stands for information from the late-time-perturbations captured by the growth of structure parameter. These are the tightest sound-horizon free $H_0$ constraints from LSS data to date. As a consequence to be viable, any $\Lambda$CDM extension proposed to address the so-called "Hubble tension" needs to modify consistently not only the sound horizon scale physics, but also the matter-radiation equality scale, in such a way that both late- and early-based $H_0$'s return results mutually consistent and consistent with the high $H_0$ value recovered by the standard cosmic distance ladder (distance-redshift relation) determinations. |

|**Abstract**| Scattering from objects near an antenna produce correlated signals from strong compact radio sources in a manner similar to those used by the Sea Interferometer to measure the radio source positions using the fine frequency structure in the total power spectrum of a single antenna. These fringes or ripples due to correlated signal interference are present at a low level in the spectrum of any single antenna and are a major source of systematics in systems used to measure the global redshifted 21-cm signal from the early universe. In the Sea Interferometer a single antenna on a cliff above the sea is used to add the signal from the direct path to the signal from the path reflected from the sea thereby forming an interferometer. This was used for mapping radio sources with a single antenna by Bolton and Slee in the 1950s. In this paper we derive analytic expressions to determine the level of these ripples and compare these results in a few simple cases with electromagnetic modeling software to verify that the analytic calculations are sufficient to obtain the magnitude of the scattering effects on the measurements of the global 21-cm signal. These analytic calculations are needed to evaluate the magnitude of the effects in cases that are either too complex or take too much time to be modeled using software. |

|**Abstract**| We present a detailed analysis of an eclipsing double-lined binary FX UMa based on TESS photometry and newly acquired spectroscopic observations. The radial velocities and atmospheric parameters for each component star are obtained from the SONG high-resolution spectra. Combined with the radial-velocity measurements, our light-curve modeling yields absolute masses and radii of the two components. The Fourier amplitude spectrum of the residual light curve reveals a total of 103 frequencies with signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) > 4, including 12 independent frequencies, 17 multiples of the orbital frequency (Nforb), and 74 combination frequencies. Ten Nforb peaks with S/N > 10 have very high amplitudes and are likely due to tidally excited oscillations (TEOs). The remaining Nforb peaks (4 < S/N < 10) may be originated from the imperfect removal, or they are actually real TEOs. Four anharmonic frequencies can pair up and sum to give exact harmonics of the orbital frequency, suggesting the existence of non-linear tidal processes in the eccentric binary system FX UMa. Eight independent frequencies in the range of 20 to 32 day$^{-1}$ are typical low-order pressure modes of delta Scuti pulsators. |

|**Abstract**| We present the first 2.5 years of data from the MeerKAT Pulsar Timing Array (MPTA), part of MeerTime, a MeerKAT Large Survey Project. The MPTA aims to precisely measure pulse arrival times from an ensemble of 88 pulsars visible from the Southern Hemisphere, with the goal of contributing to the search, detection and study of nanohertz-frequency gravitational waves as part of the International Pulsar Timing Array. This project makes use of the MeerKAT telescope, and operates with a typical observing cadence of two weeks using the L-band receiver that records data from 856-1712 MHz. We provide a comprehensive description of the observing system, software, and pipelines used and developed for the MeerTime project. The data products made available as part of this data release are from the 78 pulsars that had at least $30$ observations between the start of the MeerTime programme in February 2019 and October 2021. These include both sub-banded and band-averaged arrival times, as well as the initial timing ephemerides, noise models, and the frequency-dependent standard templates (portraits) used to derive pulse arrival times. After accounting for detected noise processes in the data, the frequency-averaged residuals of $67$ of the pulsars achieved a root-mean-square residual precision of $< 1 \mu \rm{s}$. We also present a novel recovery of the clock correction waveform solely from pulsar timing residuals, and an exploration into preliminary findings of interest to the international pulsar timing community. The arrival times, standards and full Stokes parameter calibrated pulsar timing archives are publicly available. |

|**Abstract**| MAXI J1305-704 is a transient X-ray binary with a black hole primary. It was discovered on April 9, 2012, during its only known outburst. MAXI J1305-704 is also a high inclination low-mass X-ray binary with prominent dip features in its light curves, so we check the full catalog of 92 \emph{Swift}/XRT continuous observations of MAXI J1305-704, focusing only on the stable spectra. We select 13 ``gold" spectra for which the root mean square RMS <0.075 and the coronal scattered fraction $f_{\mathrm{sc}} \lesssim 25 \%$. These ``gold" data are optimal thermal-state observations for continuum-fitting modeling, in which the disk extends to the innermost-stable circular orbit and is geometrically thin. The black hole spin was unknown for this object before. By utilizing the X-ray continuum fitting method with the relativistic thin disk model \texttt{kerrbb2} and supplying the known dynamical binary system parameters, we find MAXI J1305-704 has a moderate spin ($a_{*}=0.87_{-0.13}^{+0.07}$) at a 68.3\% confidence level. This is the first determination of MAXI J1305-704's spin. |

|**Abstract**| Based on independent shear measurements using the DECaLS/DR8 imaging data, we measure the weak lensing signals around isolated central galaxies (ICGs) from SDSS/DR7 at $z\sim0.1$. The projected stellar mass density profiles of surrounding satellite galaxies are further deduced, using photometric sources from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey (pDR3). The signals of ICGs $+$ their extended stellar halos are taken from Wang et al.(2021). All measurements are compared with predictions by the Illustris-TNG300-1 simulation. We find, overall, a good agreement between observation and TNG300. In particular, a correction to the stellar mass of massive observed ICGs is applied based on the calibration of He et al.(2013), which brings a much better agreement with TNG300 predicted lensing signals at $\log_{10}M_\ast/M_\odot>11.1$. In real observation, red ICGs are hosted by more massive dark matter halos, have more satellites and more extended stellar halos than blue ICGs at fixed stellar mass. However, in TNG300 there are more satellites around blue ICGs at fixed stellar mass, and the outer stellar halos of red and blue ICGs are similar. The stellar halos of TNG galaxies are more extended compared with real observed galaxies, especially for blue ICGs with $\log_{10}M_\ast/M_\odot>10.8$. We find the same trend for TNG100 galaxies and for true halo central galaxies. The tensions between TNG and real galaxies might indicate that satellite disruptions are stronger in TNG. In both TNG300 and observation, satellites approximately trace the underlying dark matter distribution beyond $0.1R_{200}$, but the fraction of total stellar mass in TNG300 does not show the same radial distribution as real galaxies. |

|**Abstract**| Gravitational lenses can magnify distant galaxies, allowing us to discover and characterize the stellar populations of intrinsically faint, quiescent galaxies that are otherwise extremely difficult to directly observe at high redshift from ground-based telescopes. Here, we present the spectral analysis of two lensed, quiescent galaxies at $z\gtrsim 1$ discovered by the ASTRO 3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses survey: AGEL1323 ($M_*\sim 10^{11.1}M_{\odot}$, $z=1.016$, $\mu \sim 14.6$) and AGEL0014 ($M_*\sim 10^{11.3}M_{\odot}$, $z=1.374$, $\mu \sim 4.3$). We measured the age, [Fe/H], and [Mg/Fe] of the two lensed galaxies using deep, rest-frame-optical spectra (S/N $\gtrsim$ 40\AA$^{-1}$) obtained on the Keck I telescope. The ages of AGEL1323 and AGEL0014 are $5.6^{+0.8}_{-0.8}$ Gyr and $3.1^{+0.8}_{-0.3}$ Gyr, respectively, indicating that most of the stars in the galaxies were formed less than 2 Gyr after the Big Bang. Compared to nearby quiescent galaxies of similar masses, the lensed galaxies have lower [Fe/H] and [Mg/H]. Surprisingly, the two galaxies have comparable [Mg/Fe] to similar-mass galaxies at lower redshifts, despite their old ages. Using a simple analytic chemical evolution model connecting the instantaneously recycled element Mg with the mass-loading factors of outflows averaged over the entire star formation history, we found that the lensed galaxies may have experienced enhanced outflows during their star formation compared to lower-redshift galaxies, which may explain why they quenched early. |

|**Abstract**| Dust emission from high-redshift galaxies gives us a clue to the origin and evolution of dust in the early Universe. Previous studies have shown that different sources of dust (stellar dust production and dust growth in dense clouds) predict different ultraviolet (UV) extinction curves for galaxies at $z\sim 7$ but that the observed attenuation curves depend strongly on the geometry of dust and star distributions. Thus, we perform radiative transfer calculations under the dust-stars geometries computed by a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation (IllustrisTNG). This serves to investigate the dust attenuation curves predicted from `realistic' geometries. We choose objects with stellar mass and star formation rate appropriate for Lyman break galaxies at $z\sim 7$. We find that the attenuation curves are very different from the original extinction curves in most of the galaxies. This makes it difficult to constrain the dominant dust sources from the observed attenuation curves. We further include infrared dust emission in the analysis and plot the infrared excess (IRX)-UV spectral slope ($\beta$) diagram. We find that different sources of dust cause different IRX-$\beta$ relations for the simulated galaxies. In particular, if dust growth is the main source of dust, a variation of dust-to-metal ratio causes a more extended sequence with smaller IRX in the IRX-$\beta$ diagram. Thus, the comprehensive analysis of the abundances of dust and metals, the UV slope, and the dust emission could provide a clue to the dominant dust sources in the Universe. |

|**Abstract**| The TIFR-ARIES Near Infrared Spectrometer (TANSPEC) instrument provides simultaneous wavelength coverage from 0.55 to 2.5 micron, mounted on India's largest ground-based telescope, 3.6-m Devasthal Optical Telescope at Nainital, India. The TANSPEC offers three modes of observations, imaging with various filters, spectroscopy in the low-resolution prism mode with derived R~ 100-400 and the high-resolution cross-dispersed mode (XD-mode) with derived median R~ 2750 for a slit of width 0.5 arcsec. In the XD-mode, ten cross-dispersed orders are packed in the 2048 x 2048 pixels detector to cover the full wavelength regime. As the XD-mode is most utilized as well as for consistent data reduction for all orders and to reduce data reduction time, a dedicated pipeline is at the need. In this paper, we present the code for the TANSPEC XD-mode data reduction, its workflow, input/output files, and a showcase of its implementation on a particular dataset. This publicly available pipeline pyTANSPEC is fully developed in Python and includes nominal human intervention only for the quality assurance of the reduced data. Two customized configuration files are used to guide the data reduction. The pipeline creates a log file for all the fits files in a given data directory from its header, identifies correct frames (science, continuum and calibration lamps) based on the user input, and offers an option to the user for eyeballing and accepting/removing of the frames, does the cleaning of raw science frames and yields final wavelength calibrated spectra of all orders simultaneously. |

|**Abstract**| Compact radio sources exhibit scintillation, an interference pattern arising from propagation through inhomogeneous plasma, where scintillation patterns encode the relative distances and velocities of the source, scattering material, and Earth. In Main et al. 2022, we showed that the scintillation velocity of the repeating fast radio burst FRB20201124A can be measured by correlating pairs of burst spectra, and suggested that the scattering was nearby the Earth at $\sim0.4\,$kpc from the low values of the scintillation velocity and scattering timescale. In this work, we have measured the scintillation velocity at 10 epochs spanning a year, observing an annual variation which strongly implies the screen is within the Milky Way. Modelling the annual variation with a 1D anisotropic or 2D isotropic screen results in a screen distance $d_{l} = 0.24\pm0.04\,$pc or $d_{l} = 0.37\pm0.07\,$pc from Earth respectively, possibly associated with the Local Bubble or the edge of the Orion-Eridanus Superbubble. Continued monitoring, and using measurements from other telescopes particularly at times of low effective velocity will help probe changes in screen properties, and distinguish between screen models. Where scintillation of an FRB originates in its host galaxy or local environment, these techniques could be used to detect orbital motion, and probe the FRB's local ionized environment. |

|**Abstract**| More than 100 rotating radio transients (RRATs) have been discovered since 2006. However, it is unclear whether RRATs radiate in the nulling states. PSR J0628+0909 has been classified as an RRAT. In this paper, we study the single pulses and integrated pulse profile of PSR J0628+0909 to check whether we can detect pulsed radio emission in the nulling states. We also aim to study the polarization of the RRAT and its relationship to the general pulsar population. We used the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to observe PSR J0628+0909 in the frequency range from 1.0 to 1.5 GHz. We searched for strong single pulses and looked for pulsed emission in the RRAT nulling states. Polarisation profiles, the single-pulse energy distribution, and waiting-time statistics were measured. The Faraday rotation measure and dispersion measure values are updated with the current observation. The single-pulse polarisation behaviours show great diversity, similar to the case of pulsars. Based on the integrated pulse profile and single-pulse energy statistics, we argue that continuous pulsar-like emission exists in addition to the transient-like burst emission for PSR J0628+0909. We find that the pulse waiting time is not correlated with the pulse energy and conclude that the strong transient emission of RRAT is not generated by the energy store-release mechanism. |

|**Abstract**| We have developed an algorithm to identify solar spicules in the first-ever systematic survey of on-disk spicules using exclusively Mg II spectral observations. Using this algorithm we identify 2219 events in three IRIS datasets with unique solar feature targets spanning a total of 300 minutes: 1) an active region, 2) decayed active region/active network, and 3) a coronal hole. We present event statistics and relate occurrence rates to underlying photospheric magnetic field strength. This method identifies spicule event densities and occurrence rates similar to previous studies performed using H{\alpha} and Ca II observations of active regions. Additionally, this study identifies spicule-like events at very low rates at magnetic field intensities below 20 Gauss and increasing significantly between 100-200 Gauss in active regions and above 20 Gauss in coronal holes, which can be used to inform future observation campaigns. This information can be be used to help characterize spicules over their full lifetime, and compliments existing H-{\alpha} spectral capabilities and upcoming Ly-{\alpha} spectral observations on the SNIFS Sounding Rocket. In total, this study presents a method for detecting solar spicules using exclusively Mg II spectra, and provides statistics for spicule occurrence in Mg II wavelengths with respect to magnetic field strength for the purpose of predicting spicule occurrences. |

|**Abstract**| Stars move away from their birth places over time via a process known as radial migration, which blurs chemo-kinematic relations used for reconstructing the Milky Way formation history. One of the ultimate goals of Galactic Archaeology, therefore, is to find stars' birth aggregates in the disk via chemical tagging. Here we show that stellar birth radii can be derived directly from the data with minimum prior assumptions on the Galactic enrichment history. We recover the time evolution of the stellar birth metallicity gradient, $d$[Fe/H]($R$, $\tau$)/$dR$, through its inverse relation to the metallicity range as a function of age today, allowing us to place any star with age and metallicity measurements back to its birthplace, $R_b$. Applying our method to a high-precision large data set of Milky Way disk subgiant stars, we find a steepening of the birth metallicity gradient from 11 to 8 Gyr ago, which coincides with the time of the last major merger, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE). This transition appears to play a major role in shaping both the age-metallicity relation and the bimodality in the [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane. By dissecting the disk into mono-$R_b$ populations, clumps in the low-[$\alpha$/Fe] sequence appear, which are not seen in the total sample and coincide in time with known star-formation bursts. We estimated that the Sun was born at $4.5 \pm 0.4$ kpc from the Galactic center. Our $R_b$ estimates provide the missing piece needed to recover the Milky Way formation history, while the by-product,[Fe/H]$(R$, $\tau)$, can be used as the thus-far missing prior for chemical evolution modeling. |

|**Abstract**| The evolutions of a neutron star's rotation and magnetic field (B-field) have remained unsolved puzzles for over half a century. We ascribe the rotational braking torques of pulsar to both components, the standard magnetic dipole radiation (MDR) and particle wind flow ( MDR + Wind, hereafter named MDRW), which we apply to the Crab pulsar (B0531 + 21), the only source with a known age and long-term continuous monitoring by radio telescope. Based on the above presumed simple spin-down torques, we obtain the exact analytic solution on the rotation evolution of the Crab pulsar, together with the related outcomes as described below: (1) unlike the constant characteristic B-field suggested by the MDR model, this value for the Crab pulsar increases by a hundred times in 50~kyr while its real B-field has no change; (2) the rotational braking index evolves from $\sim$3 to 1 in the long-term, however, it drops from 2.51 to 2.50 in $\sim$45 years at the present stage, while the particle flow contributes approximately 25% of the total rotational energy loss rate; (3) strikingly, the characteristic age has the maximum limit of $\sim$10 kyr, meaning that it is not always a good indicator of real age. Furthermore, we discussed the evolutionary path of the Crab pulsar from the MDR to the wind domination by comparing it with the possible wind braking candidate pulsar PSR J1734-3333. |

|**Abstract**| Finding and characterising the first galaxies that illuminated the early Universe at cosmic dawn is pivotal to understand the physical conditions and the processes that led to the formation of the first stars. In the first few months of operations, imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have been used to identify tens of candidates of galaxies at redshift (z) greater than 10, less than 450 million years after the Big Bang. However, none of these candidates has yet been confirmed spectroscopically, leaving open the possibility that they are actually low-redshift interlopers. Here we present spectroscopic confirmation and analysis of four galaxies unambiguously detected at redshift 10.3<z<13.2, previously selected from NIRCam imaging. The spectra reveal that these primeval galaxies are extremely metal poor, have masses between 10^7 and a few times 10^8 solar masses, and young ages. The damping wings that shape the continuum close to the Lyman edge are consistent with a fully neutral intergalactic medium at this epoch. These findings demonstrate the rapid emergence of the first generations of galaxies at cosmic dawn. |
