|**Abstract**|            Context. Recent JWST observations have shown that brown dwarfs (BD) are chemically rich, offering valuable insights into giant planet formation. Aims. As part of the MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS) JWST guaranteed time program, we aim to characterize the gas and dust composition of the disk around the brown dwarf [NC98] Cha HA 1, hereafter Cha H$\alpha$ 1, in the mid-infrared. Methods. We obtain data from the MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) from 4.9 to 28$\mu$m. We use the dust fitting tool DuCK to investigate the dust composition and grain sizes while we identify and fit molecular emission using slab models. Results. Compared with disks around very low mass stars, clear silicate emission features are seen in this BD disk. In addition, JWST reveals a plethora of hydrocarbons, including C$_2$H$_2$, $^{13}$CCH$_2$, CH$_3$, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_4$, C$_4$H$_2$, C$_3$H$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, and C$_6$H$_6$ which suggest a disk with a gas C/O > 1. Additionally, we detect CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, HCN, H$_2$, and H$_2$O. CO and OH are absent from the spectrum. The dust is dominated by large $\sim$4 $\mu$m size amorphous silicates (MgSiO$_3$). We infer a small dust mass fraction ($>$10$\%$) of 5 $\mu$m size crystalline forsterite. We do not detect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Conclusions. Cha H$\alpha$ 1 shows the most diverse chemistry seen to date in a BD protoplanetary disk, consisting of a strong dust feature, 12 carbon-bearing molecules plus H$_2$, and water. The diverse molecular environment offers a unique opportunity to test our understanding of BD disks chemistry and how it affects the possible planets forming in them.         |

|**Abstract**|            Leveraging the large sample size of low-resolution spectroscopic surveys to constrain white dwarf stellar structure requires an accurate understanding of the shapes of hydrogen absorption lines, which are pressure broadened by the Stark effect. Using data from both the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Type Ia Supernova Progenitor Survey, we show that substantial biases (5-15 km/s) exist in radial velocity measurements made from observations at low spectral resolution relative to similar measurements from high-resolution spectra. Our results indicate that the physics of line formation in high-density plasmas, especially in the wings of the lines, are not fully accounted for in state-of-the-art white dwarf model atmospheres. We provide corrections to account for these resolution-induced redshifts in a way that is independent of an assumed mass-radius relation, and we demonstrate that statistical measurements of gravitational redshift with these corrections yield improved agreement with theoretical mass-radius relations. Our results provide a set of best practices for white dwarf radial velocity measurements from low-resolution spectroscopy, including those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, the 4-meter Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope, and the Wide-Field Multiplexed Spectroscopic Facility.         |

|**Abstract**|            Understanding the morphological structures of Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) is crucial for unveiling their formation pathways and the physical origins of Ly$\alpha$ emission. However, the evolution of their sizes and structural scaling relations remains debated. In this study, we analyze a large sample of 876 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at $3 \lesssim z < 7$, selected from the MUSE, VANDELS, and CANDELSz7 surveys in the GOODS-S, UDS, and COSMOS fields. Utilizing deep, high-resolution near-infrared images from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we measure their rest-frame UV and optical V-band effective radii ($R_{\rm e}$) through two-dimensional Sérsic profile fitting. Our results show that these LAEs are generally compact with weak size evolution, following $R_{\rm e,UV} \propto (1 + z)^{-0.91 \pm 0.10}$ and $R_{\rm e,V} \propto (1 + z)^{-0.93 \pm 0.18}$, respectively. Their UV and optical sizes are statistically comparable, indicating negligible UV-to-optical color gradients. For the first time, we establish the rest-frame optical size-mass relation for LAEs at $z>3$, finding slopes comparable to typical star-forming galaxies (SFGs), but with slightly smaller sizes at a given stellar mass. These results provide important clues for understanding the formation mechanisms and structural evolution of LAEs in the early universe.         |
