|**Abstract**|            Massive, intensely star-forming galaxies at high redshift require a supply of molecular gas from their gas reservoirs, replenished by infall from the surrounding circumgalactic medium, to sustain their immense star-formation rates. However, our knowledge of the extent and morphology of their cold-gas reservoirs is still in its infancy. We present the results of stacking 80 hours of JVLA observations of CO(1--0) emission -- which traces the cold molecular gas -- in 19 $z=2.0-4.5$ dusty, star-forming galaxies from the AS2VLA survey. The visibility-plane stack reveals extended emission with a half-light radius of $3.8\pm0.5$~kpc, 2--3$\times$ more extended than the dust-obscured star formation and $1.4\pm0.2\times$ more extended than the stellar emission. Similarly, stacking the [CI](1--0) observations for a subsample of our galaxies yields sizes consistent with CO(1--0). The CO(1--0) size is comparable to the [CII] halos detected around high-redshift star-forming this http URL bulk (up to 80\%) of molecular gas resides outside the star-forming region; only a small part of their molecular gas reservoir directly contributes to their current star formation. Photon-dissociation region modelling indicates that the extended CO(1--0) emission arises from clumpy, dense clouds rather than smooth, diffuse gas.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-12*|

|**Abstract**|            The cosmic curvature $\Omega_{K}$ is an important parameter related to the inflationary cosmology and the ultimate fate of the universe. In this work, we adopt the non-CMB observations to constrain $\Omega_{K}$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model and its extensions. The DESI baryon acoustic oscillation, DES type Ia supernova, cosmic chronometer, and strong gravitational lensing time delay data are considered. We find that the data combination favors an open universe in the $\Lambda$CDM model, specifically $\Omega_{K}=0.108\pm0.056$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level, which is in $2.6\sigma$ tension with the Planck CMB result supporting our universe being slightly closed. In the $\Lambda$CDM extensions, the data combination is consistent with a spatially flat universe. However, the central value of $\Omega_{K}$ is positive and has a significant deviation from zero. We adopt the Akaike information criterion to compare different cosmological models. The result shows that non-flat models fit the observational data better that the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, which adds evidence to the argument that flat $\Lambda$CDM is not the ultimate model of cosmology.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the Early Data Release of the Multi-Cycle JWST-NEXUS Treasury program (2024-2028), which includes NIRCam imaging and WFSS observations from the first (partial) NEXUS-Wide epoch covering the central 100 ${\rm arcmin^2}$ of the NEXUS field, located near the North Ecliptic Pole and within the Euclid Ultra-Deep Field. We release reduced NIRCam mosaics (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F356W, F444W), photometric source catalogs, as well as preliminary WFSS spectra (in F322W2 and F444W) for the subset of bright sources (F356W$<$21 mag or F444W$<$21 mag). These observations fully cover the NEXUS-Deep area, and anchor the long-term baseline of the program. These data will be used for initial target selection for the NIRSpec/MSA spectroscopy starting from June 2025. The NIRCam imaging reaches depths of 27.4--28.2 (AB) mags in F090W--F444W. Upcoming NEXUS-Wide epochs will expand the area to the full $\sim 400\,{\rm arcmin^2}$, and improve the NIRCam exposure depths in the Wide tier by a factor of three. In addition, this central region will be repeatedly covered by the NEXUS-Deep observations (NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec/MSA PRISM spectroscopy) over 18 epochs with a $\sim 2$-month cadence. We demonstrate the data quality of the first NEXUS observations, and showcase some example science cases enabled by these data.         |

|**Abstract**|            Cepheid masses are particularly necessary to help solving the mass discrepancy, while independent distance determinations provide crucial test of the period-luminosity relation and Gaia parallaxes. We used CHARA/MIRC to measure the astrometric positions of the high-contrast companion orbiting the Cepheid SU Cygni. We also present new radial velocity measurements from the HST. The combination of interferometric astrometry with optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy provides the full orbital elements of the system, in addition to component masses and the distance to the Cepheid system. We measured the mass of the Cepheid, $M_A = 4.859\pm0.058M_\odot$, and its two companions, $M_{Ba} = 3.595 \pm 0.033 M_\odot$ and $M_{Bb} = 1.546 \pm 0.009 M_\odot$. This is the most accurate existing measurement of the mass of a Galactic Cepheid (1.2%). Comparing with stellar evolution models, we show that the mass predicted is higher than the measured mass of the Cepheid, similar to conclusions of our previous work. We also measured the distance to the system to be $926.3 \pm 5.0$pc, i.e. an unprecedented parallax precision of $6\mu$as (0.5%), being the most precise and accurate distance for a Cepheid. Such precision is similar to what is expected by Gaia for the last data release (DR5 in $\sim$ 2030) for single stars fainter than G = 13, but is not guaranteed for stars as bright as SU Cyg. We demonstrated that evolutionary models remain inadequate in accurately reproducing the measured mass, often predicting higher masses for the expected metallicity, even when factors such as rotation or convective core overshooting are taken into account. Our precise distance measurement allowed us to compare prediction period-luminosity relations. We found a disagreement of 0.2-0.5 mag with relations calibrated from photometry, while relations calibrated from direct distance measurement are in better agreement.         |

|**Abstract**|            Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright milliseconds-duration radio bursts from cosmological distances. Despite intense observational and theoretical studies, their physical origin is still mysterious. One major obstacle is the lack of identification of multi-wavelength counterparts for FRBs at cosmological distances. So far, all the searches other than in the radio wavelength, including those in the gamma-ray energies, have only left upper limits. Here we report a gigaelectronvolt (GeV) gamma-ray flare lasting 15.6 seconds as well as additional evidence of variable gamma-ray emission in temporal and spatial association with the hyper-active, newly discovered repeating FRB 20240114A, which has been localized to a dwarf galaxy at a redshift of 0.13. The energetic, short GeV gamma-ray flare reached a prompt isotropic luminosity of the order of ${10}^{48}~{\rm ergs~{s}^{-1}}$. The additional less-significant gamma-ray flares, if true, also have similar luminosities; such flares could contribute to a 5-day average luminosity of the order of ${10}^{45}~{\rm ergs~{s}^{-1}}$. These high-luminosity flares challenge the traditional FRB engine scenario involving a seconds-period magnetar. Rather, it suggests a powerful, long-lived, but newborn energy source at the location of this active repeater, either directly powering the bursts or indirectly triggering bursts in the vicinity of the FRB engine.         |

|**Abstract**|            The recent detection of extended $\gamma$-ray emission around middle-aged pulsars is interpreted as inverse-Compton scattering of ambient photons by electron-positron pairs escaping the pulsar wind nebula, which are confined near the system by unclear mechanisms. This emerging population of $\gamma$-ray sources was first discovered at TeV energies and remains underexplored in the GeV range. To address this, we conducted a systematic search for extended sources along the Galactic plane using 14 years of Fermi-LAT data above 10 GeV, aiming to identify a number of pulsar halo candidates and extend our view to lower energies. The search covered the inner Galactic plane ($\lvert l\rvert\leq$ 100$^{\circ}$, $\lvert b\rvert\leq$ 1$^{\circ}$) and the positions of known TeV sources and bright pulsars, yielding broader astrophysical interest. We found 40 such sources, forming the Second Fermi Galactic Extended Sources Catalog (2FGES), most with 68% containment radii smaller than 1.0$^{\circ}$ and relatively hard spectra with photon indices below 2.5. We assessed detection robustness using field-specific alternative interstellar emission models and by inspecting significance maps. Noting 13 sources previously known as extended in the 4FGL-DR3 catalog and five dubious sources from complex regions, we report 22 newly detected extended sources above 10 GeV. Of these, 13 coincide with H.E.S.S., HAWC, or LHAASO sources; six coincide with bright pulsars (including four also coincident with TeV sources); six are associated with 4FGL point sources only; and one has no association in the scanned catalogs. Notably, six to eight sources may be related to pulsars as classical pulsar wind nebulae or pulsar halos.         |

|**Abstract**|            Direct imaging observations are biased towards wide-separation, massive companions that have degenerate formation histories. Although the majority of exoplanets are expected to form via core accretion, most directly imaged exoplanets have not been convincingly demonstrated to follow this formation pathway. We obtained new interferometric observations of the directly imaged giant planet AF Lep b with the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument. We present three epochs of 50$\mu$as relative astrometry and the K-band spectrum of the planet for the first time at a resolution of R=500. Using only these measurements, spanning less than two months, and the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalogue of Accelerations, we are able to significantly constrain the planet's orbit; this bodes well for interferometric observations of planets discovered by Gaia DR4. Including all available measurements of the planet, we infer an effectively circular orbit ($e<0.02, 0.07, 0.13$ at $1, 2, 3 \sigma$) in spin-orbit alignment with the host, and a measure a dynamical mass of $M_\mathrm{p}=3.75\pm0.5\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$. Models of the spectrum of the planet show that it is metal rich ([M/H]$=0.75\pm0.25$), with a C/O ratio encompassing the solar value. This ensemble of results show that the planet is consistent with core accretion formation.         |
