|**Abstract**| An edge-on debris disk was detected in 2015 around the young, nearby A0V star HD 110058. The disk showed features resembling those seen in the disk of beta Pictoris that could indicate the presence of a perturbing planetary-mass companion in the system. We investigated new and archival scattered light images of the disk in order to characterise its morphology and spectrum. In particular, we analysed the disk's warp to constrain the properties of possible planetary perturbers. Our work uses data from two VLT/SPHERE observations and archival data from HST/STIS. We measured the morphology of the disk by analysing vertical profiles along the length of the disk to extract the centroid spine position and vertical height. We extracted the surface brightness and reflectance spectrum of the disk. We detect the disk between 20 au (with SPHERE) and 150 au (with STIS), at a position angle of 159.6$^\circ\pm$0.6$^\circ$. Analysis of the spine shows an asymmetry between the two sides of the disk, with a 3.4$^\circ\pm$0.9$^\circ$ warp between ~20 au and 60 au. The disk is marginally vertically resolved in scattered light, with a vertical aspect ratio of 9.3$\pm$0.7% at 45 au. The extracted reflectance spectrum is featureless, flat between 0.95 micron and 1.1 micron, and red from 1.1 micron to 1.65 micron. The outer parts of the disk are also asymmetric with a tilt between the two sides compatible with a disk made of forward-scattering particles and seen not perfectly edge-on, suggesting an inclination of <84$^\circ$. The presence of an undetected planetary-mass companion on an inclined orbit with respect to the disk could explain the warp. The misalignment of the inner parts of the disk with respect to the outer disk suggests a warp that has not yet propagated to the outer parts of the disk, favouring the scenario of an inner perturber as the origin of the warp. |

|**Abstract**| Hot corinos are of great interest due to their richness in interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs) and the consequent potential prebiotic connection to solar-like planetary systems. Recent surveys have reported an increasing number of hot corino detections in Class 0/I protostars; however, the relationships between their physical properties and the hot-corino signatures remain elusive. In this study, our objective is to establish a general picture of the detectability of the hot corinos by identifying the origin of the hot-corino signatures in the sample of young stellar objects (YSOs) obtained from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Survey of Orion Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (ALMASOP) project. We apply spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling to our sample and identify the physical parameters of the modeled YSOs directly, linking the detection of hot-corino signatures to the envelope properties of the YSOs. Imaging simulations of the methanol emission further support this scenario. We, therefore, posit that the observed COM emission originates from the warm inner envelopes of the sample YSOs, based on both the warm region size and the envelope density profile. The former is governed by the source luminosity and is additionally affected by the disk and cavity properties, while the latter is related to the evolutionary stages. This scenario provides a framework for detecting hot-corino signatures toward luminous Class 0 YSOs, with fewer detections observed toward similarly luminous Class I sources. |

|**Abstract**| Early JWST observations have uncovered a new, substantial population of red sources that might represent a previously overlooked phase of actively growing supermassive black holes (Kocevski et al. 2023, Matthee et al. 2023, Labbe et al. 2023). One of the most intriguing examples is an extremely red, point-like object that was found to be triply-imaged by the strong lensing galaxy cluster Abell 2744 (Furtak et al. 2023), allowing an unprecedented detailed look into this enigmatic population. Here we present deep spectroscopic JWST/NIRSpec observations of this object, Abell2744-QSO1. The spectroscopy confirms that the three images are of the same object, and that it is a highly reddened ($A_V\sim3$) broad emission-line Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) at a redshift of $z_{\mathrm{spec}}=7.0451\pm0.0005$. From the width of H$\beta$ ($\mathrm{FWHM}=2800\pm250\,\frac{\mathrm{km}}{\mathrm{s}}$) we derive a black hole mass of $M_{\mathrm{BH}}=3_{-1}^{+2}\times10^7\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We infer a very high ratio of black hole to galaxy mass of at least 3% and possibly as high as 100%, an order of magnitude or more than is seen in local galaxies. The lack of strong metal lines in the spectrum together with the high bolometric luminosity ($L_{\mathrm{bol}}=(1.1\pm0.3)\times10^{45}\,\frac{\mathrm{erg}}{\mathrm{s}}$) suggest that we are seeing the black hole in a phase of rapid growth, accreting at 30% of the Eddington limit. Based on early JWST imaging studies we estimate that such heavily reddened, low-mass black holes can be $\sim100$ times more common than UV-selected ones at this epoch. The rapid growth and high black hole to galaxy mass ratio of A2744-QSO1 suggests that it may represent the missing link between black hole seeds (Inayoshi et al. 2020; Greene et al. 2020; Volonteri 2021) and the first luminous quasars (Fan et al. 2023). |
