|**Abstract**| The morphology of a galaxy stems from secular and environmental processes during its evolutionary history. Thus galaxy morphologies have been a long used tool to gain insights on galaxy evolution. We visually classify morphologies on cloud-scales based on the molecular gas distribution of a large sample of 79 nearby main-sequence galaxies, using 1'' resolution CO(2-1) ALMA observations taken as part of the PHANGS survey. To do so, we devise a morphology classification scheme for different types of bars, spiral arms (grand-design, flocculent, multi-arm and smooth), rings (central and non-central rings) similar to the well-established optical ones, and further introduce bar lane classes. In general, our cold gas based morphologies agree well with the ones based on stellar light. Both our bars as well as grand-design spiral arms are preferentially found at the higher mass end of our sample. Our gas-based classification indicates a potential for misidentification of unbarred galaxies in the optical when massive star formation is present. Central or nuclear rings are present in a third of the sample with a strong preferences for barred galaxies (59%). As stellar bars are present in 45$\pm$5% of our sample galaxies, we explore the utility of molecular gas as tracer of bar lane properties. We find that more curved bar lanes have a shorter radial extent in molecular gas and reside in galaxies with lower molecular to stellar mass ratios than those with straighter geometries. Galaxies display a wide range of CO morphology, and this work provides a catalogue of morphological features in a representative sample of nearby galaxies. |

|**Abstract**| In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a two-element interferometer working in the millimeter wave band (39.5 GHz - 40 GHz) for observing solar radio emissions through nulling interference. The system is composed of two 50 cm aperture Cassegrain antennas mounted on a common equatorial mount, with a separation of 230 wavelengths. The cross-correlation of the received signals effectively cancels the quiet solar component of the large flux density (~3000 sfu) that reduces the detection limit due to atmospheric fluctuations. The system performance is obtained as follows: the noise factor of the AFE in the observation band is less than 2.1 dB, system sensitivity is approximately 12.4 K (~34 sfu) with an integration time constant of 0.1 ms (default), the frequency resolution is 153 kHz, and the dynamic range is larger than 30 dB. Through actual testing, the nulling interferometer observes a quiet sun with a low level of output fluctuations (of up to 50 sfu) and has a significantly lower radiation flux variability (of up to 190 sfu) than an equivalent single-antenna system, even under thick cloud cover. As a result, this new design can effectively improve observation sensitivity by reducing the impact of atmospheric and system fluctuations during observation. |
