|**Abstract**|            We present compelling observational evidence supporting G178.28-00.61 as an early-stage candidate for Cloud-Cloud Collision (CCC), with indications of the formation of an S-shaped filament, evenly-separated dense cores, and young star clusters. The observations of CO molecular line emission demonstrate the existence of two interacting molecular clouds with systemic velocities of 0.8 km/s and -1.2 km/s, respectively. The convergence zone of these two clouds reveals an S-shaped filament in the JCMT 850 micron continuum image, suggesting cloud interaction. In line with expectations from CCC simulations, broad bridging features are discernible in the position-velocity diagrams. An elevated concentration of identified Class I and II young stellar objects along the filament at the intersection area further supports the hypothesis of a collision-induced origin. This observation could be explained by a recent MHD model of CCC (Kong et al. 2024), which predicts a similar morphology, scale, density, and unbound status, as well as the orientation of the polarization.         |

|**Abstract**|            We aim to construct a comprehensive global multi-scale kinematic equilibrium radiative-transfer model for the pre-transitional disc of DoAr 44 (Haro 1-16, V2062 Oph) in the Ophiuchus star-forming region. This model integrates diverse observational datasets to describe the system, spanning from the accretion region to the outer disc. Our analysis utilises a large set of observational data, including ALMA continuum complex visibilities, VLTI/GRAVITY continuum squared visibilities, closure phases, and triple products, as well as VLT/UVES and VLT/X-shooter H-alpha spectra. Additionally, we incorporated absolute flux measurements from ground-based optical observatories, Spitzer, IRAS, the Submillimeter Array, the IRAM, or the ATCA radio telescopes. These data sets were used to constrain the structure and kinematics of the object through radiative-transfer modelling. Our model reveals that the spectral line profiles are best explained by an optically thin spherical inflow/outflow within the co-rotation radius of the star, exhibiting velocities exceeding 380 km/s. The VLTI near-infrared interferometric observations are consistent with an inner disc extending from 0.1 to 0.2 au. The ALMA sub-millimetre observations indicate a dust ring located between 36 and 56 au, probably related to the CO2 condensation line. The global density and temperature profiles derived from our model provide insight into an intermediate disc, located in the terrestrial planet-forming zone, which has not yet been spatially resolved.         |

|**Abstract**|            Although interstellar dust extinction serves as a powerful distance estimator, the solar system's location within the Galactic plane complicates distance determinations, especially for molecular clouds (MCs) at varying distances along the line of sight (LoS). The presence of complex extinction patterns along LoS introduces degeneracies, resulting in less accurate distance measurements to overlapping MCs in crowded regions of the Galactic plane. In this study, we develop the CUSUM-based Jump-point Analysis for Distance Estimation (CU-JADE), a novel method designed to help mitigate these observational challenges. The key strengths of CU-JADE include: (1) sensitivity to detect abrupt jumps in $Distance$-$A_{\lambda}$ ($D$-$A$) datasets, (2) minimal systematic errors as demonstrated on both mock and observed data, and (3) the ability to combine CUSUM analysis with multi-wavelength data to improve the completeness of distance measurements for nearby gas structures, even for extinction values as low as $\Delta A_{V} \gtrsim 0.15$ mag. By combining CO survey data with a large sample of stars characterized by high-precision parallaxes and extinctions, we uncovered the multi-layered molecular gas distribution in the high-latitude Cepheus region. We also determined accurate distances to MCs beyond the Cygnus Rift by analyzing the intricate structure of gas and extinction within the Galactic plane. Additionally, we constructed a full-sky 3D extinction map extending to 4 kpc, which provides critical insights into dense interstellar medium components dominated by molecular hydrogen. These results advance our understanding of the spatial distribution and physical properties of MCs across the Milky Way.         |

|**Abstract**|            The study of pulsar glitches provides a unique window into the internal structure and dynamic processes of neutron stars. PSR J0007+7303, a very bright gamma-ray pulsar, is the first pulsar discovered by the Fermi-LAT telescope. In this paper, we present the 15 years of timing results of this pulsar using the Fermi-LAT data. We identified nine glitches, five of which are newly discovered. Among these, two are small glitches, occurring between the three previously reported ones, while the other four are large glitches. The glitches exhibit fractional frequency changes ranging from 15 x 10^-9 to 1238 x 10^-9, with intervals of approximately 1-2 years between events. Uniquely, this pulsar shows no exponential recovery behavior following any glitch, setting it apart from most glitching pulsars. Furthermore, no significant changes were observed in the gamma-ray pulse profile, flux, or phase-averaged spectra before and after glitches, indicating the stability of the pulsar's emission properties despite internal changes. A parametric analysis of the glitches yielded a fractional moment of inertia of the crustal superfluid involved in glitches as 1.06 percent, which matches extremely well with previous statistical work if the non-dissipative entrainment effect is not considered and strongly supports the internal origin of these glitches. These results highlight the distinct glitch behavior of PSR J0007+7303 and offer valuable insights into the crust-superfluid interaction in neutron stars. The physical origin of no exponential recovery is also discussed.         |
