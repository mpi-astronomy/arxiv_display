|**Abstract**|            Computing photo-z for AGN is challenging, primarily due to the interplay of relative emissions associated with the SMBH and its host galaxy. SED fitting methods, effective in pencil-beam surveys, face limitations in all-sky surveys with fewer bands available, lacking the ability to capture the AGN contribution to the SED accurately. This limitation affects the many 10s of millions of AGN clearly singled out and identified by SRG/eROSITA. Our goal is to significantly enhance photometric redshift performance for AGN in all-sky surveys while avoiding the need to merge multiple data sets. Instead, we employ readily available data products from the 10th Data Release of the Imaging Legacy Survey for DESI, covering > 20,000 deg$^{2}$ with deep images and catalog-based photometry in the grizW1-W4 bands. We introduce PICZL, a machine-learning algorithm leveraging an ensemble of CNNs. Utilizing a cross-channel approach, the algorithm integrates distinct SED features from images with those obtained from catalog-level data. Full probability distributions are achieved via the integration of Gaussian mixture models. On a validation sample of 8098 AGN, PICZL achieves a variance $\sigma_{\textrm{NMAD}}$ of 4.5% with an outlier fraction $\eta$ of 5.6%, outperforming previous attempts to compute accurate photo-z for AGN using ML. We highlight that the model's performance depends on many variables, predominantly the depth of the data. A thorough evaluation of these dependencies is presented in the paper. Our streamlined methodology maintains consistent performance across the entire survey area when accounting for differing data quality. The same approach can be adopted for future deep photometric surveys such as LSST and Euclid, showcasing its potential for wide-scale realisation. With this paper, we release updated photo-z (including errors) for the XMM-SERVS W-CDF-S, ELAIS-S1 and LSS fields.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-13*|

|**Abstract**|            The MUltiplexed Survey Telescope (MUST) is a 6.5-meter telescope under development. Dedicated to highly-multiplexed, wide-field spectroscopic surveys, MUST observes over 20,000 targets simultaneously using 6.2-mm pitch positioning robots within a ~5 deg2 field of view. MUST aims to carry out the first Stage-V spectroscopic survey in the 2030s to map the 3D Universe with over 100 million galaxies and quasars, spanning from the nearby Universe to redshift z~5.5, corresponding to around 1 billion years after the Big Bang. To cover this extensive redshift range, we present an initial conceptual target selection algorithm for different types of galaxies, from local bright galaxies, luminous red galaxies, and emission line galaxies to high-redshift (2 < z < 5.5) Lyman-break galaxies. Using Fisher forecasts, we demonstrate that MUST can address fundamental questions in cosmology, including the nature of dark energy, test of gravity theories, and investigations into primordial physics. This is the first paper in the series of science white papers for MUST, with subsequent developments focusing on additional scientific cases such as galaxy and quasar evolution, Milky Way physics, and dynamic phenomena in the time-domain Universe.         |

|| M. L. Li, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. El-Badry</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-13*|
|*Comments*| *40 pages, 18 figures, 20 tables*|
|**Abstract**|            In the past few years, the improved sensitivity and cadence of wide-field optical surveys have enabled the discovery of several afterglows without associated detected gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We present the identification, observations, and multiwavelength modeling of a recent such afterglow (AT2023lcr), and model three literature events (AT2020blt, AT2021any, and AT2021lfa) in a consistent fashion. For each event, we consider the following possibilities as to why a GRB was not observed: 1) the jet was off-axis; 2) the jet had a low initial Lorentz factor; and 3) the afterglow was the result of an on-axis classical GRB (on-axis jet with physical parameters typical of the GRB population), but the emission was undetected by gamma-ray satellites. We estimate all physical parameters using afterglowpy and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods from emcee. We find that AT2023lcr, AT2020blt, and AT2021any are consistent with on-axis classical GRBs, and AT2021lfa is consistent with both on-axis low Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_0 \approx 5 - 13$) and off-axis ($\theta_\text{obs}=2\theta_\text{jet}$) high Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_0 \approx 100$) jets.         |

|| R.-P. Kudritzki, et al. -- incl., <mark>S. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-13*|
|*Comments*| *accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal*|
|**Abstract**|            A quantitative spectroscopic study of blue supergiant stars in the Hubble constant anchor galaxy NGC 4258 is presented. The non-LTE analysis of Keck I telescope LRIS spectra yields a central logarithmic metallicity (in units of the solar value) of [Z] = -0.05\pm0.05 and a very shallow gradient of -(0.09\pm0.11)r/r25 with respect to galactocentric distance in units of the isophotal radius. Good agreement with the mass-metallicity relationship of star forming galaxies based on stellar absorption line studies is found. A comparison with HII region oxygen abundances obtained from the analysis of strong emission lines shows reasonable agreement when the Pettini & Pagel (2004) calibration is used, while the Zaritsky et al. (1994) calibration yields values that are 0.2 to 0.3 dex larger. These results allow to put the metallicity calibration of the Cepheid Period--Luminosity relation in this anchor galaxy on a purely stellar basis. Interstellar reddening and extinction are determined using HST and JWST photometry. Based on extinction-corrected magnitudes, combined with the stellar effective temperatures and gravities we determine, we use the Flux-weighted Gravity--Luminosity Relationship (FGLR) to estimate an independent spectroscopic distance. We obtain a distance modulus m-M = 29.38\pm0.12 mag, in agreement with the geometrical distance derived from the analysis of the water maser orbits in the galaxy's central circumnuclear disk.         |
