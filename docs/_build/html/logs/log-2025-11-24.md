|**Abstract**|            We present measurements of key protoplanetary disk properties inferred from parametric models of ALMA 12CO spectral line visibilities. We derive gas-disk radii, integrated fluxes, optically thick emission layers, and brightness temperature profiles for the disk population of the old (4 - 14 Myr) Upper Scorpius star-forming region. We measure CO emission sizes for 37 disks with bright CO J=3-2 emission (S/N > 10 on the integrated flux; out of the 83 disks with CO detections), finding that the median radius containing 90% of the flux is ~84 au, with radii spanning from 23 up to 243 au. We report a correlation between the 12CO brightness temperatures and stellar luminosities, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.6, and we use it to prove that the 12CO optically thick emission layer primarily emanates from a region below the super-heated dust, which is optically thin to the stellar irradiation. Moreover, we derive 33 CO emission surface height profiles, finding a median aspect ratio <z/r> ~ 0.16 in a range from ~0.01 up to ~0.45 over the sample. Finally, we comment on the multiple systems in our sample, of which only some were already known. These results re-affirm how it is possible to derive bulk disk properties by modeling moderate angular resolution ALMA visibilities.         |

|**Abstract**|            Water is one of the central molecules for the formation and habitability of planets. In particular, the region where water freezes-out, the water snowline, could be a favorable location to form planets in protoplanetary disks. We use high resolution ALMA observations to spatially resolve H$_2$O, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and SO emission in the HL Tau disk. A rotational diagram analysis is used to characterize the water reservoir seen with ALMA and compare this to the reservoir visible at mid- and far-IR wavelengths. We find that the H$_2$O 183 GHz line has a compact central component and a diffuse component that is seen out to ~75 au. A radially resolved rotational diagram shows that the excitation temperature of the water is ~350 K independent of radius. The steep drop in the water brightness temperature outside the central beam of the observations where the emission is optically thick is consistent with the water snowline being located inside the central beam ($\lesssim 6$ au) at the height probed by the observations. Comparing the ALMA lines to those seen at shorter wavelengths shows that only 0.02%-2% of the water reservoir is visible at mid- and far-IR wavelengths, respectively, due to optically thick dust hiding the emission whereas 35-70% is visible with ALMA. An anti-correlation between the H$_2$O and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ emission is found but this is likely caused by optically thick dust hiding the H$^{13}$CO$^+$ emission in the disk center. Finally, we see SO emission tracing the disk and for the first time in SO a molecular outflow and the infalling streamer out to ~2". The velocity structure hints at a possible connection between the SO and the H$_2$O emission. Spatially resolved observations of H$_2$O lines at (sub-)mm wavelengths provide valuable constraints on the location of the water snowline, while probing the bulk of the gas-phase reservoirs.         |

|**Abstract**|            To investigate how the presence of baryons in simulations affects galaxy merger orbits, we compare in detail the merger timescales and orbits of the matched merger pairs in TNG100 hydrodynamical simulations and their corresponding dark-matter-only simulations, for different resolution levels. Compared with the mergers in the TNG100-1-Dark simulation without baryons, the matched mergers in the TNG100-1 simulation have similar infall time, but have statistically earlier merger times and therefore shorter merger timescales. The merger orbits for the matched pairs in the TNG100-1 and the TNG100-1-Dark simulations are similar right after infall, and both evolve to more head-on orbits at final stages, with smaller changes in the hydrodynamical simulation. In the final 2 Gyr before merger, the collision angles that represent merger orbits quantitatively are smaller in TNG100-1 than those in TNG100-1-Dark, by around 6$^\circ$ to 10$^\circ$, depending on the mass ratios and galaxy masses investigated. Our results demonstrate that the presence of baryons accelerates a bit the merger processes, and results in more spiral-in orbits for both major and minor mergers in galaxies with various stellar masses. These effects are less obvious in simulations with lower resolutions.         |

|| Y. Zhang, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            Recent observations with SRG/eROSITA have revealed the average X-ray surface brightness profile of the X-ray-emitting circumgalactic medium (CGM) around Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies, offering valuable insights into the baryon mass in these systems. However, the estimation of the baryon mass depends critically on several assumptions regarding the gas density profile, temperature, metallicity, and the underlying halo mass distribution. Here, we assess how these assumptions affect the inferred baryon mass of the X-ray-emitting CGM in MW-mass galaxies, based on the stacked eROSITA signal. We find that variations in temperature profiles and uncertainties in the halo mass introduce the dominant sources of uncertainty, resulting in X-ray-emitting baryon mass estimates that vary by nearly a factor of four ($0.8-3.5\times10^{11} M_\odot$). Assumptions about metallicity contribute an additional uncertainty of approximately $50\%$. We emphasize that accurate X-ray spectral constraints on gas temperature and metallicity, along with careful modeling of halo mass uncertainty, are essential for accurately estimating the baryon mass for MW-mass galaxies. Future X-ray microcalorimeter missions will be crucial for determining the hot CGM properties and closing the baryon census at the MW-mass scale.         |

|| B. Catinella, et al. -- incl., <mark>E. Schinnerer</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            The Multiphase Astrophysics to Unveil the Virgo Environment (MAUVE) project is a multi-facility programme exploring how dense environments transform galaxies. Combining a VLT/MUSE P110 Large Programme and ALMA observations of 40 late-type Virgo Cluster galaxies, MAUVE resolves star formation, kinematics, and chemical enrichment within their molecular gas discs. A key goal is to track the evolution of cold gas that survives in the inner regions of satellites after entering the cluster, and how it evolves across different infall stages. With its high spatial resolution -- probing down to the physical scales of giant molecular cloud complexes -- and multiphase synergy, MAUVE aims to offer a time-resolved view of environmental quenching and set a new benchmark for cluster galaxy studies.         |
