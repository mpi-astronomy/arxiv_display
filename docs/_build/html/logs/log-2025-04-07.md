|**Abstract**|            Aims: The presence of a Yukawa-like correction to Newtonian gravity is investigated at the Galactic Center, leading to a new upper limit for the intensity of such a correction. Methods: We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using the astrometric and spectroscopic data of star S$2$ collected at the Very Large Telescope by GRAVITY, NACO and SINFONI instruments, covering the period from $1992$ to $2022$. Results: The precision of the GRAVITY instrument allows us to derive the most stringent upper limit at the Galactic Center for the intensity of the Yukawa contribution ($\propto \, \alpha e^{- \lambda r}$) to be $|\alpha| < 0.003$ for a scale length $\lambda = 3 \cdot 10^{13}\, \rm m\, (\sim 200 \, \rm AU)$. This improves by roughly one order of magnitude all estimates obtained in previous works.         |

|**Abstract**|            Aims: Previous estimates of planet occurrence rates in the CARMENES survey indicated increased numbers of planets on short orbits for M dwarfs with masses below 0.34\,M$_\odot$. Here we focused on the lowest-mass stars in the survey, comprising 15 inactive targets with masses under 0.16\,M$_\odot$. Methods: To correct for detection biases, we determined detection sensitivity maps for individual targets and the entire sample. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimated planet occurrence rates for orbital periods of 1\,d to 100\,d and minimum masses from 0.5\,M$_\oplus$ to 10\,M$_\oplus$. Results: The radial velocity (RV) data from CARMENES reveal four new planets around three stars in our sample, namely G~268--110\,b, G~261--6\,b, and G~192--15\,b and c. All three b planets have minimum masses of 1.03--1.52\,M$_\oplus$ and orbital periods of 1.43--5.45\,d, while G~192--15\,c is a 14.3\,M$_\oplus$ planet on a wide, eccentric orbit with $P \approx 1218$\,d and $e \approx 0.68$. Our occurrence rates suggest considerable dependencies with respect to stellar masses. For planets below 3\,M$_\oplus$ we found rates consistent with one planet per star across all investigated periods, but the rates decrease almost by an order of magnitude for larger planet masses up to 10\,M$_\oplus$. Compared to previous studies, low-mass stars tend to harbor more planets with $P <10$\,d. We also demonstrate that synthetic planet populations based on the standard core accretion scenario predict slightly more massive planets on wider orbits than observed. Conclusions: Our findings confirm that planet occurrence rates vary with stellar masses even among M dwarfs, as we found more planets with lower masses and on shorter orbits in our subsample of very low-mass stars compared to more massive M dwarfs. Therefore, we emphasize the need for additional differentiation in future studies.         |

|**Abstract**|            The search of exoplanets around nearby M dwarfs is a crucial milestone to perform the census of planetary systems in the vicinity of our Solar System. Since 2018 our team is carrying a radial-velocity blind search program for planets around nearby M dwarfs with the near-IR spectro-polarimeter and velocimeter SPIRou at the CFHT and the optical velocimeter SOPHIE at the OHP in France. Here we present our results on Gl 410, a 0.55 Msun 480+-150 Myr old active M dwarf distant 12 pc. We use the line-by-line (LBL) technique to measure the RVs with SPIRou and the template matching method with SOPHIE. Three different methods, two based in principal component analysis (PCA), are used to clean the SPIRou RVs for systematics. Gaussian processes (GP) modeling is applied to correct the SOPHIE RVs for stellar activity. The l1 and apodize sine periodogram (ASP) analysis is used to search for planetary signals in the SPIRou data taking into account activity indicators. We analyse TESS data and search for planetary transits. We report the detection of a M sin(i)=8.4+-1.3 Mearth sub-Neptune planet at a period of 6.020+-0.004 days in circular orbit with SPIRou. The same signal, although with lower significance, is also retrieved in the SOPHIE RV data after correction for activity using a GP trained on SPIRou's longitudinal magnetic field (Bl) measurements. TESS data indicates that the planet is not transiting. We find within the SPIRou wPCA RVs tentative evidence for two additional planetary signals at 2.99 and 18.7 days. In conclusion, infrared RVs are a powerful method to detect extrasolar planets around active M dwarfs, care should be taken however to correct/filter systematics generated by residuals of the telluric correction or small structures in the detector plane. The LBL technique combined with PCA offers a promising way to reach this objective. Further monitoring of Gl 410 is necessary.         |

|**Abstract**|            Analyzing longitude-velocity diagrams (LVDs) in the CS(J=2-1) and H13CN(J=1-0) molecular lines from the internal release data of the ALMA Central-Molecular-Zone Exploration Survey (ACES) and in the 13CO (J=1-0) line from the Nobeyama Galactic-Centre (GC) survey, we identify six GC Arms as prominent straight LV ridges. In addition to the currently known Arms I to IV, we identify a new inner arm, Arm V, and further highlight the circum-nuclear disc (CND) as Arm VI. Integrated intensity maps of the Arms on the sky suggest that most of the Arms compose ring-like structures inclined from the Galactic plane. We determine the radii (curvatures) of the Arms using the velocity-gradient ($dv/dl$) method, assuming that the arms are rotating on circular orbits at a constant velocity of $\sim 150$ km/s. We show that Arms I and II compose the main ring structure of the CMZ with radii $\sim 100$--120 pc; Arm III is a dense arm 42 pc from the GC; Arm IV is a clear and narrow arm 20 pc from the GC; and Arm V is a faint, long arm of 8.2 pc radius. We show that the circum-nuclear disc (CND) composes the sixth arm, Arm VI, of radius $\sim 2.3$ pc associated with bifurcated spiral fins. We also discuss the association of the 20- and 50-km/s clouds with these Arms. The radii of the arms fall on an empirical relation $R\sim 630 (2/5)^N$ for $N=1$ (Arm I) to 6 (VI), suggesting either discrete rings or a logarithmic spiral with pitch angle $\sim 22^\circ$. The vertical full extent of the arm increases with radius and is represented by $z\sim 0.7 (R/1 {\rm pc})^{0.7}$ pc. The tilt angle of the arms from the Galactic plane, or the warping, increases rapidly toward the GC.         |
