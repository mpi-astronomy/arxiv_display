|**Abstract**|            A longstanding prediction in interstellar theory posits that significant quantities of molecular gas, crucial for star formation, may be undetected due to being ``dark" in commonly used molecular gas tracers, such as carbon monoxide. We report the discovery of Eos, the closest dark molecular cloud, located just 94 parsecs from the Sun. This cloud is the first molecular cloud ever to be identified using H$_2$ far ultra-violet (FUV) fluorescent line emission, which traces molecular gas at the boundary layers of star-forming and supernova remnant regions. The cloud edge is outlined along the high-latitude side of the North Polar Spur, a prominent x-ray/radio structure. Our distance estimate utilizes 3D dust maps, the absorption of the soft X-ray background, and hot gas tracers such as O\,{\sc vi}; these place the cloud at a distance consistent with the Local Bubble's surface. Using high-latitude CO maps we note a small amount (M$_{\rm{H}_2}\approx$20-40\,M$_\odot$) of CO-bright cold molecular gas, in contrast with the much larger estimate of the cloud's true molecular mass (M$_{\rm{H}_2}\approx3.4\times 10^3$\,M$_\odot$), indicating most of the cloud is CO-dark. Combining observational data with novel analytical models and simulations, we predict this cloud will photoevaporate in 5.7 million years, placing key constraints on the role of stellar feedback in shaping the closest star-forming regions to the Sun.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Cosmic Dawn Survey Pre-launch (PL) catalogues cover an effective 10.13 deg$^{2}$ area with uniform deep Spitzer/IRAC data ($m\sim25$ mag, 5$\sigma$), the largest area covered to these depths in the infrared. These data are used to gain new insight into the growth of stellar mass across cosmic history by characterising the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) through $0.2 < z \leq 6.5$. The total volume (0.62 Gpc$^{3}$) represents a tenfold increase compared to previous works that have explored $z > 3$ and significantly reduces cosmic variance, yielding strong constraints on the abundance of massive galaxies. Results are generally consistent with the literature but now provide firm estimates of number density where only upper limits were previously available. Contrasting the GSMF with the dark matter halo mass function suggests that massive galaxies ($M \gtrsim10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$) at $z > 3.5$ required integrated star-formation efficiencies of $M/(M_{\rm h}f_{\rm b}) \gtrsim$ 0.25--0.5, in excess of the commonly-held view of ``universal peak efficiency" from studies on the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR). Such increased efficiencies imply an evolving peak in the SHMR at $z > 3.5$ which can be maintained if feedback mechanisms from active galactic nuclei and stellar processes are ineffective at early times. In addition, a significant fraction of the most massive quiescent galaxies are observed to be in place already by $z\sim 2.5$--3. The apparent lack in change of their number density by $z\sim 0.2$ is consistent with relatively little mass growth from mergers. Utilising the unique volume, evidence for an environmental dependence of the galaxy stellar mass function is found all the way through $z\sim 3.5$ for the first time, though a more careful characterisation of the density field is ultimately required for confirmation.         |

|**Abstract**|            There is a broad consensus from theory that stellar feedback in galaxies at high redshifts is essential to their evolution, alongside conflicting evidence in the observational literature about its prevalence and efficacy. To this end, we utilize deep, high-resolution [CII] emission line data taken as part of the [CII] resolved ISM in star-forming galaxies with ALMA (CRISTAL) survey. Excluding sources with kinematic evidence for gravitational interactions, we perform a rigorous stacking analysis of the remaining 15 galaxies to search for broad emission features that are too weak to detect in the individual spectra, finding only weak evidence that a broad component is needed to explain the composite spectrum. Additionally, such evidence is mostly driven by CRISTAL-02, which is already known to exhibit strong outflows in multiple ISM phases. Interpreting modest residuals in the stack at $v\sim300$kms$^{-1}$ as an outflow, we derive a mass outflow rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm out}=26\pm11$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ and a cold outflow mass-loading factor of $\eta_m=0.49\pm0.20$. This result holds for the subsample with the highest star-formation rate surface density $(\Sigma_{\rm{SFR}}>1.93$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$) but no such broad component is present in the composite of the lower-star-formation rate density subsample. Our results imply that the process of star-formation-driven feedback may already be in place in typical galaxies at $z=5$, but on average not strong enough to completely quench ongoing star formation.         |

|| M. Lin, et al. -- incl., <mark>Y. Wang</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            In this article, we report the multiwavelength and multiview observations of transverse oscillations of two loop strands induced by a jet-related, confined flare in active region NOAA 13056 on 11 July 2022. The jet originates close to the right footpoint of the loops and propagates in the northeast direction. The average rise time and fall time of the jet are $\approx$ 11 and $\approx$ 13.5 minutes, so that the lifetime of the jet reaches $\approx$ 24.5 minutes. The rising motion of the jet is divided into two phases with average velocities of $\approx$ 164 and $\approx$ 546\,km\,s$^{-1}$. The falling motion of the jet is coherent with an average velocity of $\approx$ 124\,km\,s$^{-1}$. The transverse oscillations of the loops, lasting for 3 $-$ 5 cycles, are of fundamental standing kink mode. The maximal initial amplitudes of the two strands are $\approx$ 5.8 and $\approx$ 4.9 Mm. The average periods are $\approx$ 405\,s and $\approx$ 407\,s. Both of the strands experience slow expansions during oscillations. The lower limits of the kink speed are 895$_{-17}^{+21}$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ for loop\_1 and 891$_{-35}^{+29}$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ for loop\_2, respectively. The corresponding lower limits of the Alfvén speed are estimated to be 664$_{-13}^{+16}$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ and 661$_{-26}^{+22}$\,km\,s$^{-1}$.         |

|**Abstract**|            The dynamical method provides an efficient way to discover post-common-envelope binaries (PCEB) with faint white dwarfs (WDs), thanks to the development of time-domain survey projects. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the PCEB system TMTS J15530469+4457458 (J1553), discovered by the Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescopes for Survey, to explore its physical origin and evolutionary fate. This system is characterized by double-peaked Balmer emission lines, and a cross-correlation function is applied to derive its radial velocity (RV) from a series of phase-resolved Keck spectra. Analyses with the cross-correlation function suggest that this system is a single-lined spectroscopic binary and only one star is optically visible. Further analysis through Doppler tomography indicates that J1553 is a detached binary without an accretion disk. Under such a configuration, the simultaneous light-curve and RV fitting reveal that this system contains an unseen WD with mass $M_{\rm A}=0.56\pm 0.09\, M_{\odot}$, and an M4 dwarf with mass $M_{\rm B}=0.37\pm 0.02\,M_{\odot}$ and radius $R_{\rm B}=0.403^{+0.014}_{-0.015}\,R_{\odot}$. The extra prominent Balmer emission lines seen in the spectra can trace the motion of the WD, which are likely formed near the WD surface as a result of wind accretion. According to the MESA simulation, J1553 could have evolved from a binary consisting of a 2.0-4.0 ${M}_{\odot}$ zero-age-main-sequence star and an M dwarf with an initial orbital period $P_i\approx 201-476$ d, and the system has undergone a common-envelope (CE) phase. After about $3.3\times10^6$ yr, J1553 should evolve into a cataclysmic variable, with a transient state as a supersoft X-ray source at the beginning. J1553 is an excellent system for studying wind accretion, CE ejection physics, and binary evolution theory.         |
