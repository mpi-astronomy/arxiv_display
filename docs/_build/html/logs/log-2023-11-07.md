|**Abstract**| With the unprecedented increase of known star clusters, quick and modern tools are needed for their analysis. In this work, we develop an artificial neural network trained on synthetic clusters to estimate the age, metallicity, extinction, and distance of $Gaia$ open clusters. We implement a novel technique to extract features from the colour-magnitude diagram of clusters by means of the QuadTree tool and we adopt a multi-band approach. We obtain reliable parameters for $\sim 5400$ clusters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology in accurately determining crucial parameters of $Gaia$ open clusters by performing a comprehensive scientific validation. In particular, with our analysis we have been able to reproduce the Galactic metallicity gradient as it is observed by high-resolution spectroscopic surveys. This demonstrates that our method reliably extracts information on metallicity from colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of stellar clusters. For the sample of clusters studied, we find an intriguing systematic older age compared to previous analyses present in the literature. This work introduces a novel approach to feature extraction using a QuadTree algorithm, effectively tracing sequences in CMDs despite photometric errors and outliers. The adoption of ANNs, rather than Convolutional Neural Networks, maintains the full positional information and improves performance, while also demonstrating the potential for deriving clusters' parameters from simultaneous analysis of multiple photometric bands, beneficial for upcoming telescopes like the Vera Rubin Observatory. The implementation of ANN tools with robust isochrone fit techniques could provide further improvements in the quest for open clusters' parameters. |

|**Abstract**| AI and deep learning techniques are beginning to play an increasing role in astronomy as a necessary tool to deal with the data avalanche. Here we describe an application for finding resolved Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in crowded, wide-field, narrow-band H-alpha survey imagery in the Galactic plane. PNe are important to study late stage of stellar evolution of low to intermediate-mass stars. However, the confirmed ~3800 Galactic PNe fall far short of the numbers expected. Traditional visual searching for resolved PNe is time-consuming due to the large data size and areal coverage of modern astronomical surveys, especially those taken in narrow-band filters highlighting emission nebulae. To test and facilitate more objective, reproducible, efficient and reliable trawls for PNe candidates we have developed a new, deep learning algorithm. In this paper, we applied the algorithm to several H-alpha digital surveys (e.g. IPHAS and VPHAS+). The training and validation dataset was built with true PNe from the HASH database. After transfer learning, it was then applied to the VPHAS+ survey. We examined 979 out of 2284 survey fields with each survey field covering 1 * 1 deg^2. With a sample of 454 PNe from the IPHAS as our validation set, our algorithm correctly identified 444 of these objects (97.8%), with only 16 explicable 'false' positives. Our model returned ~20,000 detections, including 2637 known PNe and many other kinds of catalogued non-PNe such as HII regions. A total of 815 new high-quality PNe candidates were found, 31 of which were selected as top-quality targets for subsequent optical spectroscopic follow-up. Representative preliminary confirmatory spectroscopy results are presented here to demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques with full details to be given in paper-II. |

|**Abstract**| Measurement of the redshifted 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen from the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) promises to unveil a wealth of information about the astrophysical processes during the first billion years of evolution of the universe. The AARTFAAC Cosmic Explorer (ACE) utilises the AARTFAAC wide-field imager of LOFAR to measure the power spectrum of the intensity fluctuations of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the CD at z~18. The RFI from various sources contaminates the observed data and it is crucial to exclude the RFI-affected data in the analysis for reliable detection. In this work, we investigate the impact of non-ground-based transient RFI using cross-power spectra and cross-coherence metrics to assess the correlation of RFI over time and investigate the level of impact of transient RFI on the ACE 21-cm power spectrum estimation. We detected moving sky-based transient RFI sources that cross the field of view within a few minutes and appear to be mainly from aeroplane communication beacons at the location of the LOFAR core in the 72-75 MHz band, by inspecting filtered images. This transient RFI is mostly uncorrelated over time and is only expected to dominate over the thermal noise for an extremely deep integration time of 3000 hours or more with a hypothetical instrument that is sky temperature dominated at 75 MHz. We find no visible correlation over different k-modes in Fourier space in the presence of noise for realistic thermal noise scenarios. We conclude that the sky-based transient RFI from aeroplanes, satellites and meteorites at present does not pose a significant concern for the ACE analyses at the current level of sensitivity and after integrating over the available 500 hours of observed data. However, it is crucial to mitigate or filter such transient RFI for more sensitive experiments aiming for significantly deeper integration. |
