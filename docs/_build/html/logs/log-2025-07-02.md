|**Abstract**|            Context: Inferring the likely formation channel of giant exoplanets and brown dwarf companions from orbital and atmospheric observables remains a formidable challenge. Further and more precise directly measured dynamical masses of these companions are required to inform and gauge formation, evolutionary, and atmospheric models. We present an updated study of HIP 99770 b based on observations conducted with VLTI/GRAVITY. Aims: Combining the new data with previous observations from the literature, we characterise HIP 99770 b to better constrain its orbit, dynamical mass, and atmospheric properties, as well as to shed light on its likely formation channel. Methods: We ran a renewed orbit fit to further constrain the dynamical mass of the companion and the orbit solution. We also analysed the GRAVITY K-band spectrum, placing it into context with literature data, and extracting magnitude, age, spectral type, bulk properties and atmospheric characteristics of HIP 99770 b. Results: We detected the companion at a radial separation of $417\,\mathrm{mas}$ from its host. The new orbit fit yields a dynamical mass of $17_{-5}^{+6}\,\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{Jup}$ and an eccentricity of $0.31_{-0.12}^{+0.06}$. We also find that additional relative astrometry epochs in the future will not enable further constraints on the dynamical mass due to the dominating relative uncertainty on the Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion anomaly. The publication of Gaia DR4 will likely ease this predicament. We find that the companion is consistent with spectral type L8 and exhibits a potential metal enrichment in its atmosphere. Conclusions: These results do not yet allow for a definite inference of the companion's formation channel. Nevertheless, the new constraints on its bulk properties and the additional GRAVITY spectrum presented here will aid future efforts to determine the formation history of HIP 99770 b.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) hosts 12 known Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs), seven of which apparently single. Their formation is a challenge for current stellar evolution models, because line-driven winds are generally assumed to be quenched at a metallicity Z<0.004. Here, we present a set of MESA models of single stars with zero-age main sequence masses 20-80 M_sun, considering different initial rotation speeds (Omega=0-0.7 Omega_c), metallicities (Z=0.002-0.0045), and wind mass-loss models (optically thin and thick winds). We show that if we account for optically thick winds, as described by Sabhahit+2023, fast rotating (Omega=0.6 Omega_c) single metal-poor O-type stars (with M>20 M_sun) shed their envelope and become WR stars even at the low metallicity of the SMC. The luminosity, effective temperature, evolutionary timescale, surface abundance, and rotational velocity of our simulated WR stars are compatible to the WRs observed in the SMC. We speculate that this scenario can also alleviate the excess of giant stars across the Humphreys-Davidson limit. Our results have key implications for black hole masses, (pair instability) supernova explosions, and other observable signatures.         |

|**Abstract**|            Recent claims of biosignature gases in sub-Neptune atmospheres have renewed interest in water-rich sub-Neptunes with surface oceans, often referred to as Hycean planets. These planets are hypothesized to form beyond the snow line, accreting large amounts of H$_2$O >10 wt%) before migrating inward. However, current interior models often neglect chemical equilibration between primordial atmospheres and molten interiors. Here, we compute global chemical equilibrium states for a synthetic population of sub-Neptunes with magma oceans. Although many initially accrete 5-30 wt% water, interior-atmosphere interactions destroy most of it, reducing final H$_2$O mass fractions to below 1.5 wt%. As a result, none meet the threshold for Hycean planets. Despite that, we find H$_2$O-dominated atmospheres exclusively on planets that accreted the least ice. These planets form inside the snow line, are depleted in carbon and hydrogen, and develop small envelopes with envelope mass fractions below 1%, dominated by endogenic water. In contrast, planets formed beyond the snow line accrete more volatiles, but their water is largely converted to H$_2$ gas or sequestered into the interior, resulting in low atmospheric H$_2$O mass fractions. Most H$_2$O-rich envelopes are also fully miscible with H$_2$, making a separate water layer unlikely. Our results topple the conventional link between ice accretion and water-rich atmospheres, showing instead that H$_2$O-dominated envelopes emerge through chemical equilibration in hydrogen-poor planets formed inside the snow line.         |

|**Abstract**|            Carbon dioxide is one of the three most abundant species within the ice mantles around dust grains inside molecular clouds. Since a substantial amount of interstellar grains is made of siliceous materials, we have studied the infrared profile of CO2 deposited on top of a bare and ice-coated amorphous silicate (MgFeSiO4) film using reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS). In contrast to a metal surface, the CO2 IR profile shows a relaxation of the metal surface selection rule in the presence of the bare MgFeSiO4 dust grain analog, which brings the IR profile closer to the observational spectra while maintaining the sensitivity of RAIRS. Experiments with the underlying CO and CH4 ices show that their presence facilitates structural changes toward crystalline ice for the deposited CO2 at much lower temperatures than on the polar ice layers. Warming-up experiments of CO2 showed that it tends to stay on the silicate surface for much longer than on the gold surface without the silicate layer. We noticed for the first time a split in the 13CO2 IR feature on the pure or ice-covered silicate grain as a marker for the onset of diffusion. The laboratory 13CO2 profile then closely resembles recent JWST observations of this feature around young and embedded protostars, suggesting that it can be linked to the observed feature.         |

|**Abstract**|            Rocky exoplanet characterization has been a top priority for early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) science operations. Several milestones have been achieved, including the most precise rocky planet transmission spectra measured to date, and the first detection of thermal emission for rocky worlds below 800 Kelvin. Despite these advances, no atmospheres have been definitively detected. Several transmission spectra show tentative evidence for molecular absorption features, but these hints are marginally significant and the spectra may be affected by stellar contamination. Features from many plausible atmospheres, including those dominated by oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, are below the current noise level. Meanwhile, the emerging picture from thermal emission spectra is that the planets have hot daysides, consistent with either a bare rock composition or low surface pressure atmospheres (< 10 bar). Higher surface pressures and high carbon dioxide abundances are generally ruled out, assuming cloud-free atmosphere models. The absence of strong CO$_2$ features hints at a limited initial volatile inventory or rapid atmospheric escape during the planets' early lifetimes. Taken together, these results motivate a push towards higher precision data, as well as observations of cooler planets that may be more likely to retain atmospheres. As a goal for future transmission spectroscopy, we suggest a "five scale height challenge," to achieve the precision necessary to detect CO$_2$ features in nitrogen-rich atmospheres. Detecting rocky planet atmospheres remains challenging, but with JWST's excellent performance and a continuing investment of telescope time, we are optimistic these uncharted atmospheres will be detected in coming years.         |

|**Abstract**|            In this work, we observe the nearby pulsar, PSR B1929$+$10, using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). We find, for the first time, two new emission components with an extremely weak observed flux density of about $10^{-4}$ of the magnitude of the peak radio emission of PSR B1929$+$10. Our results show that the intrinsic radio emission of PSR B1929$+$10 covers the $360^{\circ}$ of longitude, demonstrating that this pulsar is a whole $360^{\circ}$ of longitude emission pulsar. We find at least 15 components of pulse emission in the average pulse profile. Additionally, we identify 5 modes of subpulse modulation in different emission regions, which differ from the pulse components. Moreover, the narrowband emission feature and the frequent jumps in the observed linear polarization position angle (PPA) are also detected in the single pulse of this pulsar. To understand the magnetosphere of this pulsar, we analyze the observed PPA variations across the whole $360^{\circ}$ of longitude and fit them using the classical rotating vector model (RVM). For the best-fit model, the inclination angle,$\alpha$, and the impact angle, $\beta$, of this pulsar are $55^{\circ}.56$ and $53^{\circ}.47$, respectively. Using the rotating magnetosphere approximation of the magnetic dipole field, we investigate the three-dimensional pulsar magnetosphere and the sparking pattern on the polar cap surface. Our analysis indicates that the extremely narrow zone of the polar cap, which is associated with a high-altitude magnetospheric region, is responsible for the weak emission window. This pulsar has extremely high-altitude magnetospheric radio emissions.         |

|**Abstract**|            Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the brightest electromagnetic bursts in the universe, are believed to originate from ultra-relativistic jets launched by the rapidly rotating central engine, either a disk-surrounded newly formed black hole (BH) or a magnetar. Such a central engine potentially possesses rapidly evolving physical characteristics, as it is just born. The caught of time-increasing frequency in the gravitational wave signals is the evidence of upon opinion. Here we report a possible oscillatory signal identified in GRB 131122B with periods increasing from 1.27 seconds to 4.02 seconds in a time interval of 16.75 seconds. Such a peculiar oscillation signal has not been identified in GRBs before and its periodic evolution could also be the quickest one found in the electromagnetic radiation window of astrophysics. The precession of a misaligned accretion disk caused by the tidal disruption of a star by an intermediate-mass BH may be responsible for this signal. This finding could open a new window to reveal the nature of the hiding central engine of GRBs.         |

|**Abstract**|            The particle acceleration and transport process during solar eruptions is one of the critical and long-standing problems in space plasma physics. Through decades of research, it is well accepted that particles with higher energies released during a solar eruption arrive at observers earlier than the particles with lower energies, forming a well-known structure in the dynamic energy spectrum called particle velocity dispersion (VD), as frequently observed by space missions. However, this picture is challenged by new observations from NASA's Parker Solar Probe and ESA's Solar Orbiter which show an unexpected inverse velocity dispersion (IVD) phenomenon, where particles with higher-energies arrive later at the observer. Facing on the challenge, we here report the recent discovery of such IVD structures with 10 solar energetic proton events observed by Solar Orbiter, and then analyze the mechanisms causing this unusual phenomenon. We suggest that shock diffusive acceleration, with respect to magnetic reconnection, is probably a dominant mechanism to accelerate protons to tens of MeV in such events where particles need longer time to reach higher energies. And we determine, innovatively, the physical conditions and time scales during the actual shock acceleration process that cannot be observed directly.         |
