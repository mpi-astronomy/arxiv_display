|**Abstract**| Our knowledge of relations between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies at $z\gtrsim1$ is still limited, even though being actively sought out to $z\sim6$. Here, we use the high resolution and sensitivity of JWST to measure the host galaxy properties for 61 X-ray-selected type-I AGNs at $0.7<z<2.5$ with rest-frame optical/near-infrared imaging from COSMOS-Web and PRIMER. Black hole masses ($\log\left(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot\right)\sim7.5-9.5$) are available from previous spectroscopic campaigns. We extract the host galaxy components from four NIRCam broadband images and the HST/ACS F814W image by applying a 2D image decomposition technique. We detect the host galaxy for $\sim90\%$ of the sample after subtracting the unresolved AGN emission. With host photometry free of AGN emission, we determine the stellar mass of the host galaxies to be $\log\left(M_*/M_\odot\right)\sim10-11.5$ through SED fitting and measure the evolution of the mass relation between SMBHs and their host galaxies. Considering selection biases and measurement uncertainties, we find that the $M_\mathrm{ BH}/M_*$ ratio evolves as $\left(1+z\right)^{0.37_{-0.60}^{+0.35}}$ thus remains essentially constant or exhibits mild evolution up to $z\sim2.5$. We also see an amount of scatter ($\sigma_{\mu}=0.28\pm0.13$) is similar to the local relation and consistent with low-$z$ studies; this appears to not rule out non-causal cosmic assembly where mergers contribute to the statistical averaging towards the local relation. We highlight improvements to come with larger samples from JWST and, particularly, Euclid, which will exceed the statistical power of wide and deep surveys such as Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam. |

|**Abstract**| We investigate the feasibility of using the velocity acoustic oscillations (VAO) features on the Cosmic Dawn 21 cm power spectrum to probe small-scale density fluctuations. In the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model, Pop III stars form in minihalos and affect the 21 cm signal through Ly$\alpha$ and X-ray radiation. Such a process is modulated by the relative motion between dark matter and baryons, generating the VAO wiggles on the 21 cm power spectrum. In the fuzzy or warm dark matter models for which the number of minihalos is reduced, the VAO wiggles are weaker or even fully invisible. We investigate the wiggle features in the CDM with different astrophysical models and in different dark matter models. We find: 1) In the CDM model the relative streaming velocities can generate the VAO wiggles for broad ranges of parameters $f_*$, $\zeta_X$ and $f_{\rm esc,LW}\zeta_{\rm LW}$, though for different parameters the wiggles would appear at different redshifts and have different amplitudes. 2) For the axion model with $m_{\rm a} \lesssim10^{-19}$ eV, the VAO wiggles are negligible. In the mixed model, the VAO signal is sensitive to the axion fraction. For example, the wiggles almost disappear when $f_{\rm a} \gtrsim 10\%$ for $m_{\rm a}=10^{-21}$ eV. Therefore, the VAO signal can be an effective indicator for small-scale density fluctuations and a useful probe of the nature of dark matter. The SKA-low with $\sim$2000 hour observation time has the ability to detect the VAO signal and constraint dark matter models. |

|**Abstract**| Gravitational microlensing is a phenomenon that allows us to observe dark remnants of stellar evolution even if they no longer emit electromagnetic radiation. In particular, it can be useful to observe solitary neutron stars or stellar-mass black holes, providing a unique window through which to understand stellar evolution. Obtaining direct mass measurements with this technique requires precise observations of both the change in brightness and the position of the microlensed star and the European Space Agency's Gaia satellite can provide both. We analysed events published in Gaia Data Release 3 (GDR3) microlensing catalogue using publicly available data from different surveys. Here we describe our selection of candidate dark lenses, where we suspect the lens is a white dwarf (WD), a neutron star (NS), a black hole (BH), or a mass-gap object, with a mass in a range between the heaviest NS and the least massive BH. We estimated the mass of the lenses using information obtained from the best-fitting microlensing models, the Galactic model and the expected distribution of the parameters. We found eight candidates for WDs or NS, and two mass-gap objects. |
