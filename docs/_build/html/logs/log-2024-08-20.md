|**Abstract**|            The PDS 70 system, hosting two planets within its disk, is an ideal target for examining the effect of planets on dust accumulation, growth, and ongoing planet formation. Here, we present high-resolution ($0.''07 = 8 \ \mathrm{au}$) dust continuum observations of the PDS 70 disk in ALMA Band 3 (3.0 mm). While previous Band 7 observations showed a dust ring with slight asymmetry, our Band 3 observations reveal a more prominent asymmetric peak in the northwest direction, where the intensity is 2.5 times higher than in other directions and the spectral index is at the local minimum with $\alpha_{\mathrm{SED}} \sim 2.2$. This indicates that a substantial amount of dust is accumulated both radially and azimuthally in the peak. We also detect point-source emission around the stellar position in the Band 3 image, which is likely to be free-free emission. We constrain the eccentricity of the outer ring to be $e<0.04$ from the position of the central star and the outer ring. From the comparison with numerical simulations, we constrain the mass of PDS 70c to be less than 4.9 Jupiter masses if the gas turbulence strength $\alpha_{\mathrm{turb}} = 10^{-3}$. Then, we discuss the formation mechanism of the disk structures and further planet formation scenarios in the disk.         |

|**Abstract**|            The formation of the massive stars, and in particular, the role that the magnetic fields play in their early evolutionary phase is still far from being completely understood. Here, we present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.2 mm full polarized continuum, and H$^{13}$CO$^+$(3$-$2), CS(5$-$4), and HN$^{13}$C(3$-$2) line observations with a high angular resolution ($\sim$0.4$''$ or 1100 au). In the 1.2 mm continuum emission, we reveal a dusty envelope surrounding the massive protostars, IRAS16547-E and IRAS16547-W, with dimensions of $\sim$10,000 au. This envelope has a bi-conical structure likely carved by the powerful thermal radio jet present in region. The magnetic fields vectors follow very-well the bi-conical envelope. The polarization fraction is $\sim$2.0\% in this region. Some of these vectors seem to converge to IRAS 16547-E, and IRAS 16547-W, the most massive protostars. Moreover, the velocity fields revealed from the spectral lines H$^{13}$CO$^+$(3$-$2), and HN$^{13}$C(3$-$2) show velocity gradients with a good correspondence with the magnetic fields, that maybe are tracing the cavities of molecular outflows or maybe in some parts infall. We derived a magnetic field strength in some filamentary regions that goes from 2 to 6.1\,mG. We also find that the CS(5$-$4) molecular line emission reveals multiple outflow cavities or bow-shocks with different orientations, some of which seem to follow the NW-SE radio thermal jet.         |

|**Abstract**|            Detecting primordial fluctuations from the cosmic dark ages requires extremely large low-frequency radio telescope arrays deployed on the far side of the Moon. The antenna of such an array must be lightweight, easily storable and transportable, deployable on a large scale, durable, and capable of good electrical performance. A membrane antenna is an excellent candidate to meet these criteria. We study the design of a low-frequency membrane antenna for a lunar-based low-frequency (<30 MHz) radio telescope constructed from polyimide film widely used in aerospace applications, owing to its excellent dielectric properties and high stability as a substrate material. We first design and optimize an antenna in free space through dipole deformation and coupling principles, then simulate an antenna on the lunar surface with a simple lunar soil model, yielding an efficiency greater than 90% in the range of 12-19 MHz and greater than 10% in the range of 5-35 MHz. The antenna inherits the omni-directional radiation pattern of a simple dipole antenna in the 5-30 MHz frequency band, giving a large field of view and allowing detection of the 21 cm global signal when used alone. A demonstration prototype is constructed, and its measured electrical property is found to be consistent with simulated results using |S11| measurements. This membrane antenna can potentially fulfill the requirements of a lunar low-frequency array, establishing a solid technical foundation for future large-scale arrays for exploring the cosmic dark ages.         |

|**Abstract**|            Brown dwarfs and planetary-mass companions display rotationally modulated photometric variability, especially those near the L/T transition. This variability is commonly attributed to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) inhomogeneities, with proposed models including patchy thick and thin clouds, planetary-scale jets, or chemical disequilibrium. Surface mapping techniques are powerful tools to probe their atmospheric structures and distinguish between models. One of the most successful methods for stellar surface mapping is Doppler imaging, where the existence of TOA inhomogeneities can be inferred from their varying Doppler shifts across the face of a rotating star. We applied Doppler imaging to the nearest brown dwarf binary WISE 1049AB (aka Luhman 16AB) using time-resolved, high-resolution spectroscopic observations from Gemini IGRINS, and obtained for the first time H and K band simultaneous global weather map for brown dwarfs. Compared to the only previous Doppler map for a brown dwarf in 2014 featuring a predominant mid-latitude cold spot on WISE 1049B and no feature on WISE 1049A, our observations detected persistent spot-like structures on WISE 1049B in the equatorial to mid-latitude regions on two nights, and revealed new polar spots on WISE 1049A. Our results suggest stability of atmospheric features over timescale of days and possible long-term stable or recurring structures. H and K band maps displayed similar structures in and out of CO bands, indicating the cold spots not solely due to chemical hotspots but must involve clouds. Upcoming 30-m extremely large telescopes (ELTs) will enable more sensitive Doppler imaging of dozens of brown dwarfs and even a small number of directly-imaged exoplanets.         |

|**Abstract**|            The emission of Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) and Soft Gamma-Ray Repeaters (SGRs) is believed to be powered by the dissipation of their strong magnetic fields, which coined the name `magnetar'. By combining timing and energy observational results, the magnetar model can be easily appreciated. From a timing perspective, the magnetic field strengths of AXPs and SGRs, calculated assuming dipole radiation, are extremely strong. From an energy perspective, the X-ray/soft gamma-ray luminosities of AXPs and SGRs are larger than their rotational energy loss rates (i.e., $ L_{\rm X}>\dot E_{\rm rot}$). It is thus reasonable to assume that the high-energy radiation comes from magnetic energy decay, and the magnetar model has been extensively discussed (or accepted). However, we argue that: (1) calculating magnetic fields by assuming that rotational energy loss is dominated by dipole radiation (i.e., $\dot{E}_{\rm rot}\simeq\dot{E}_{\mu}$)) may be controversial, and we suggest that the energies carried by outflowing particles should also be considered; and (2) the fact that X-ray luminosity is greater than the rotational energy loss rate does not necessarily mean that the emission energy comes from the magnetic field decaying, which requires further observational testing. Furthermore, some observational facts conflict with the `magnetar' model, such as observations of anti-magnetars, high magnetic field pulsars, and radio and X-ray observations of AXPs/SGRs. Therefore, we propose a crusted strange star model as an alternative, which can explain many more observational facts of AXPs/SGRs.         |

|| <mark>X. Zhang</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-08-20*|
|*Comments*| *16 pages, 15 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            Super-resolution (SR) models in cosmological simulations use deep learning (DL) to rapidly supplement low-resolution (LR) runs with statistically correct, fine details. The SR technique preserves large-scale structures by conditioning on a low-resolution (LR) version of the simulation. On smaller scales, the generative deep learning (DL) process is stochastic, resulting in numerous possible SR realizations, each with unique small-scale structures. Validation of SR then relies on making sure that a specific statistic of interest is accurately reproduced by comparing SR and high resolution (HR) runs. In this study, we develop an emulator designed to reproduce the individual small-scale structures of an HR simulation as closely as possible. We process an SR realization alongside a specific High-Resolution Initial Condition (HRIC), transforming the SR output to emulate the results of a full simulation with that HRIC. By comparing visualizations, individual halo measures and cross-correlating Fourier modes we show that the emulated SR runs closely align with the corresponding HR simulation, even on length scales an order of magnitude smaller than the LR run. Additionally, small halos are trained to match the HR simulation, and the subhalo mass function is more accurately reproduced. These results show the promise of this method for generating numerous fast and accurate simulations and mock observations for large galaxy surveys.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report the highest-redshift detection of [O I] 63 $\mu$m from a luminous quasar, J2054-0005, at $z=6.04$ based on the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array Band 9 observations. The [O I] 63 $\mu$m line luminosity is $(4.5\pm1.5) \times 10^{9}~L_{\rm \odot}$, corresponding to the [O I] 63 $\mu$m-to-far-infrared luminosity ratio of $\approx 6.7\times10^{-4}$, which is consistent with the value obtained in the local universe. Remarkably, [O I] 63 $\mu$m is as bright as [C II] 158 $\mu$m, resulting in the [O I]-to-[C II] line luminosity ratio of $1.3\pm0.5$. Based on a careful comparison of the luminosity ratios of [O I] 63 $\mu$m, [C II] 158 $\mu$m, and dust continuum emission to models of photo-dissociation regions, we find that J2054-0005 has a gas density log($n_{\rm H}$/cm$^{-3}$)$=3.7\pm0.3$ and an incident far-ultraviolet radiation field of log($G/G_{\rm 0}$)$= 3.0\pm0.1$, showing that [O I] 63 $\mu$m serves as an important coolant of the dense and warm gas in J2054-0005. A close examination of the [O I] and [C II] line profiles suggests that the [O I] line may be partially self-absorbed, however deeper observations are needed to verify this conclusion. Regardless, the gas density and incident radiation field are in a broad agreement with the values obtained in nearby star-forming galaxies and objects with [O I] 63 $\mu$m observations at $z=1-3$ with the Herschel Space Observatory. These results demonstrate the power of ALMA high-frequency observations targeting [O I] 63 $\mu$m to examine the properties of photo-dissociation regions in high-redshift galaxies.         |

|| J. Cao, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-08-20*|

|**Abstract**|            This paper primarily investigates the effect of the tilt of corner cube reflector (CCR) arrays on lunar laser ranging (LLR). A mathematical model was established to study the random errors caused by the tilt of the CCR arrays. The study found that, ideally, when the laser ranging pulse width is 10 picoseconds or less, it is possible to distinguish from which specific corner cubes within the CCR array each peak in the echo signal originates. Consequently, partial data from the echo can be extracted for signal processing, significantly reducing random errors and improving the single-shot precision of LLR. The distance obtained by extracting part of the echo can be reduced to the center position of the array, thereby providing multiple higher-precision ranging results from each measurement. This not only improves the precision of LLR but also increases the data volume. A simulation experiment based on the 1.2 m laser ranging system at Yunnan Observatories was conducted. By extracting one peak for signal processing, the single-shot precision improved from 32.24 mm to 2.52 mm, validating the theoretical analysis results. Finally, an experimental laser ranging system based on a 53 cm binocular telescope system was established for ground experiments. The experimental results indicated that the echo signal could identify the tilt state of the CCR array. By extracting the peak returned by the central CCR for signal processing, the ranging precision was greatly improved. Through theoretical analyses, simulation experiments, and ground experiments, a solution to reduce the random errors caused by the tilt of the CCR array was provided. This offers an approach to enhance the single-shot precision of future LLR and provides a reference for upgrading ground-based equipment at future laser ranging stations.         |
