      ) | **The Variation of the Galaxy-Wide IMF for Low-Mass Stars: Modeling and Observational Insights**  |

|**Abstract**|            The Stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) characterizes the mass distribution of newly formed stars in various cosmic environments, serving as a fundamental assumption in astrophysical research. Recent findings challenge the prevalent notion of a universal and static IMF, proposing instead that the IMF's shape is contingent upon the star formation environment. In this study, we analyze the galaxy-wide variation of the IMF for low-mass stars in both dwarf and massive galaxies with diverse observational methods. Despite systematic discrepancies between different approaches, an IMF model with a metallicity-dependent slope for the low-mass stars aligns with the majority of observations, indicating a high degree of uniformity in the star formation processes across the universe. We also emphasize the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the variation of the low-mass IMF, considering measurement biases and factors beyond metallicity.         |

      ) | **Is the James Webb Space Telescope detecting too many AGN candidates?**  |
|| <mark>M. Habouzit</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-05-10*|
|*Comments*| *11 pages, submitted to the journal*|
|**Abstract**|            In less than two years of operation, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has already accelerated significantly our quest to identify active massive black holes (BHs) in the first billion years of the Universe's history. At the time of writing, about 50 AGN detections and candidates have been identified through spectroscopy, photometry, and/or morphology. Broad-line AGN are about a hundred times more numerous than the faint end of the UV-bright quasar population at z~5-6. In this paper, we compare the observational constraints on the abundance of these AGN at z~5 to the populations of AGN produced in large-scale cosmological simulations. Assuming a null fraction of obscured simulated AGN, we find that while some simulations produce more AGN than discovered so far, some others produce a similar abundance or even fewer AGN in the bolometric luminosity range probed by JWST. Keeping in mind the large uncertainty on the constraints, we discuss the implications for the theoretical modeling of BH formation and evolution in case similar constraints continue to accumulate. At the redshift of interest, the simulated AGN populations diverge the most at Lbol~1e44 erg/s (by more than a dex in the bolometric luminosity function). This regime is most affected by incompleteness in JWST surveys. However, it holds significant potential for constraining the physical processes determining the assembly of BHs (e.g., seeding, feedback from supernova and AGN) and the current abundance of broad-line AGN with >1e44.5 erg/s.         |

      ) | **Do spiral arms enhance star formation efficiency?**  |
|| M. Querejeta, et al. -- incl., <mark>E. Schinnerer</mark>, <mark>S. Stuber</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            Spiral arms are some of the most spectacular features in disc galaxies, and also present in our own Milky Way. It has been argued that star formation should proceed more efficiently in spiral arms as a result of gas compression. Yet, observational studies have so far yielded contradictory results. Here we examine arm/interarm surface density contrasts at ~100 pc resolution in 28 spiral galaxies from the PHANGS survey. We find that the arm/interarm contrast in stellar mass surface density (Sigma_*) is very modest, typically a few tens of percent. This is much smaller than the contrasts measured for molecular gas (Sigma_mol) or star formation rate (Sigma_SFR) surface density, which typically reach a factor of ~2-3. Yet, Sigma_mol and Sigma_SFR contrasts show a significant correlation with the enhancement in Sigma_*, suggesting that the small stellar contrast largely dictates the stronger accumulation of gas and star formation. All these contrasts increase for grand-design spirals compared to multi-armed and flocculent systems (and for galaxies with high stellar mass). The median star formation efficiency (SFE) of the molecular gas is 16% higher in spiral arms than in interarm regions, with a large scatter, and the contrast increases significantly (median SFE contrast 2.34) for regions of particularly enhanced stellar contrast (Sigma_* contrast >1.97). The molecular-to-atomic gas ratio (Sigma_mol/Sigma_atom) is higher in spiral arms, pointing to a transformation of atomic to molecular gas. In conclusion, the boost in the star formation efficiency of molecular gas in spiral arms is generally modest or absent, except for locations with exceptionally large stellar contrasts.

      ) | **A PAge-like Unified Dark Fluid Model**  |

|*Appeared on*| *2024-05-10*|

|**Abstract**|            The unified dark fluid model unifies dark matter and dark energy into a single component, providing an alternative and more concise framework for interpreting cosmological observations. We introduce a PAge-like Unified Dark Fluid (PUDF) model based on the PAge approximation (Huang 2020), which is parameterized by the age of the universe and an $\eta$ parameter indicating the deviation from Einstein-De Sitter Universe. The PUDF model shares many similar features of the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and can effectively describe the large-scale structure formation and late-time cosmic acceleration. We constrain the PUDF model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillation measurements including those from the most recent DESI 2024, the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia supernovae, and the Cosmic Chronometers compilation. Although the PUDF performs well in fitting all the cosmological datasets, the joint analysis of the data still favors the $\Lambda$CDM model over the PUDF model, according to the Bayesian evidence of model comparison.         |

      ) | **Time-dependent long-term hydrodynamic simulations of the inner protoplanetary disk III: The influence of photoevaporation**  |
|| <mark>M. Cecil</mark>, L. Gehrig, D. Steiner |

|**Abstract**|            The final stages of a protoplanetary disk are essential for our understanding of the formation and evolution of planets. Photoevaporation is an important mechanism that contributes to the dispersal of an accretion disk and has significant consequences for the disk's lifetime. However, the combined effects of photoevaporation and star-disk interaction have not been investigated in previous studies. We combined an implicit disk evolution model with a photoevaporative mass-loss profile. By including the innermost disk regions down to 0.01 AU, we could calculate the star-disk interaction, the stellar spin evolution, and the transition from an accreting disk to the propeller regime self-consistently. Starting from an early Class II star-disk system, we calculated the long-term evolution of the system until the disk becomes almost completely dissolved. Photoevaporation has a significant effect on disk structure and evolution. The radial extent of the dead zone decreases, and the number of episodic accretion events (outbursts) is reduced by high stellar X-ray luminosities. Reasonable accretion rates in combination with photoevaporative gaps are possible for a dead zone that is still massive enough to develop episodic accretion events. Furthermore, the stellar spin evolution during the Class II evolution is less affected by the star-disk interaction in the case of high X-ray luminosities. Our results suggest that the formation of planets, especially habitable planets, in the dead zone is strongly impaired in the case of strong X-ray luminosities. Additionally, the importance of the star-disk interaction during the Class II phase with respect to the stellar spin evolution is reduced.         |
