|**Abstract**|            We report the discovery of a complete Einstein ring around the elliptical galaxy NGC 6505, at $z=0.042$. This is the first strong gravitational lens discovered in Euclid and the first in an NGC object from any survey. The combination of the low redshift of the lens galaxy, the brightness of the source galaxy ($I_\mathrm{E}=18.1$ lensed, $I_\mathrm{E}=21.3$ unlensed), and the completeness of the ring make this an exceptionally rare strong lens, unidentified until its observation by Euclid. We present deep imaging data of the lens from the Euclid Visible Camera (VIS) and Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) instruments, as well as resolved spectroscopy from the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). The Euclid imaging in particular presents one of the highest signal-to-noise ratio optical/near-infrared observations of a strong gravitational lens to date. From the KCWI data we measure a source redshift of $z=0.406$. Using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) we measure a velocity dispersion for the lens galaxy of $\sigma_\star=303\pm15\,\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$. We model the lens galaxy light in detail, revealing angular structure that varies inside the Einstein ring. After subtracting this light model from the VIS observation, we model the strongly lensed images, finding an Einstein radius of 2.5 arcsec, corresponding to $2.1\,\mathrm{kpc}$ at the redshift of the lens. This is small compared to the effective radius of the galaxy, $R_\mathrm{eff}\sim 12.3\,\mathrm{arcsec}$. Combining the strong lensing measurements with analysis of the spectroscopic data we estimate a dark matter fraction inside the Einstein radius of $f_\mathrm{DM} = (11.1_{-3.5}^{+5.4})\%$ and a stellar initial mass-function (IMF) mismatch parameter of $\alpha_\mathrm{IMF} = 1.26_{-0.08}^{+0.05}$, indicating a heavier-than-Chabrier IMF in the centre of the galaxy.         |

|**Abstract**|            We re-determine planetary occurrences around M dwarfs using 20 years of observations from HARPS on 197 targets. The first aim of this study is to propose more precise occurrence rates using the large volume of the sample but also variations to previous calculations, particularly by considering multiplicity, which is now an integral part of planetary occurrence calculations. The second aim is to exploit the extreme longevity of HARPS to determine occurrence rates in the unexplored domain of very long periods. This work relies entirely on the 197 radial velocity time series obtained and analysed in our previous study. By considering they are cleaned of any detectable signal, we convert them into detection limits. We use these 197 limits to produce a detectability map and combine it with confirmed planet detections to establish our occurrence rates. Finally, we also convert the detection limits from orbital period to insolation in order to construct an occurrence statistics for the temperate zone. We find a strong prevalence of low-mass planets around M dwarfs, with an occurrence rate of 120% for planets with a mass between 0.75 and 3 Me. In addition, we compute an occurrence rate of 45.3% +20-16% for temperate zone planets around M dwarfs. We obtain an occurrence rate of a few percent for giant planets with wide separations. In our sample these giant planets with wide separations are only detected around the most massive M dwarfs.         |

|**Abstract**|            Quasars behind the Galactic plane (GPQs) are excellent tracers to probe the chemistry and kinematics of the interstellar/intergalactic medium (ISM/IGM) of the Milky Way along sight lines via absorption line spectroscopy. Moreover, the quasars located at low Galactic latitudes will fill the gap in the spatial distribution of known quasars near the Galactic plane, and can be used to construct an astrometric reference frame for accurate measurements of proper motions (PMs) of stars, and substructures of the Milky Way. We started a survey of background quasars in the low Galactic latitude region since the LAMOST phase II survey in 2017. Quasar candidates have been selected from the optical and infrared photometric data of Pan-STARRS1 and WISE surveys based on their variability and color properties. In this paper, we present a sample of 1982 spectroscopically confirmed GPQs with |b| <= 20 degree based on LAMOST Data Release 10 (DR10). Among them, 1338 are newly discovered. Most GPQs are located around 240<l<90 degree, and the spatial distributions are non-uniform. These GPQs have a magnitude distribution with a peak at i-mag 19.0, and mostly around 18.0-19.5mag. The peak of redshift distributions is around ~1.5, and most GPQs have redshifts between 0.3 and 2.5. Our finding demonstrates the potential discovery space for the GPQs from the spectroscopic surveys and the promising applications for future research.         |

|**Abstract**|            After a successful kick-off meeting in 2021. two workshops in 2022 and 2023 on the future Global Cosmic-Ray Observatory (GCOS) focused mainly on a straw man design of the detector and science possibilities for astro- and particle physics. About 100 participants gathered for in-person and hybrid panel discussions. In this report, we summarize these discussions, present a preliminary straw-man design for GCOS and collect short write-ups of the flash talks given during the focus sessions.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report ALMA and ACA observations of atomic carbon ([\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$) and dust continuum in 10 Enormous Ly$\alpha$ Nebulae hosting ultra-luminous Type-I QSOs at $z=2.2-2.5$, as part of the SUrvey of Protocluster ELANe Revealing CO/CI in the Ly$\alpha$ Detected CGM (SUPERCOLD-CGM). We detect [\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$ and dust in all ten QSOs and five companion galaxies. We find that the QSOs and companions have higher gas densities and more intense radiation fields than Luminous Infrared galaxies and high-$z$ main sequence galaxies, with the highest values found in the QSOs. By comparing molecular gas masses derived from [\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$, CO(4$-$3) and dust continuum, we find that the QSOs and companions display a similar low CO conversion factor of $\alpha_{\rm CO}$\,$\sim$\,0.8 $\rm M_{\sun}$${[\rm K\,km/s\,pc^2]}^{-1}$. After tapering our data to low resolution, the [\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$ flux increases for nine QSOs, hinting at the possibility of [\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$ in the circum-galactic medium (CGM) on a scale of 16$-$40 kpc. However, the [\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$ sensitivity is too low to confirm this for individual targets, except for a tentative (2.7$\sigma$) CGM detection in Q0050+0051{} with M$_{\rm H_2}$\,=\, ($1.0 - 2.8$)$\times 10^{10}$ $\rm M_{\sun}$. The 3$\sigma$ mass limits of molecular CGM for the remaining QSO fields are ($0.2-1.4$)\,$\times$\,10$^{10}$ $\rm M_{\sun}$. This translates into a baryon fraction of $<$0.4-3$\% $ in the molecular CGM relative to the total baryonic halo mass. Our sample also includes a radio-detected AGN, Q1416+2649{}, which shows [\ion{C}{1}]$(1-0)$ and CO(4$-$3) luminosities an order of magnitude fainter for its far-infrared luminosity than other QSOs in our sample, possibly due to a lower molecular gas mass.         |

|| W. Thompson, et al. -- incl., <mark>T. Henning</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-02-11*|
|*Comments*| *Resubmitted to AJ*|
|**Abstract**|            The companion GL229B was recently resolved by Xuan et al. (2024) as a tight binary of two brown dwarfs (Ba and Bb) through VLTI-GRAVITY interferometry and VLT-CRIRES+ RV measurements. Here, we present Bayesian models of the interferometric and RV data in additional detail, along with an updated outer orbit of the brown dwarf pair about the primary. To create a model of the inner orbit with robust uncertainties, we apply kernel phases to the GRAVITY data to address baseline redundancy in the raw closure phases. Using parallel tempering, we constrain the binary's orbit using only VLTI-GRAVITY data, despite each epoch having low visibility-plane coverage and/or SNR. We demonstrate very agreement the VLTI-GRAVITY and CRIRES+ datasets and find that the inner binary has a period of 12.1346$\pm$0.0011 days, eccentricity of 0.2317$\pm$0.0025, and total mass of 71.0$\pm$0.4 Mjup, with Ba and Bb having masses of 37.7$\pm$1.1Mjup and 33.4$\pm$1.0Mjup respectively. With new Keck/NIRC2 astrometry, we update the outer orbit GL229B around the primary. We find a semi-major axis of 42.9+3.0-2.4AU, eccentricity of 0.736$\pm$0.014, and a total mass for B of 71.7$\pm$0.6Mjup, consistent with that derived from the inner orbit. We find a mutual inclination of 31$\pm$2.5deg, below the threshold for Kozai-Lidov oscillations. The agreement on the mass of Ba+Bb between the inner and outer orbits is an important test of our ability to model RV, astrometry, and Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion anomaly. Our methodological advances in handling interferometric data with low SNR and sparse UV-coverage will benefit future observations of rapidly-orbiting companions with VLTI-GRAVITY.         |
