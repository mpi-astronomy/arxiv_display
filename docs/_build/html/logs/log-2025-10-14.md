|**Abstract**|            We present a spectroscopically-selected [OIII]+Hb emitters catalogue at 6.75<z<9.05 and the resulting [OIII] 5008 Ã…Luminosity Function (LF) in the COSMOS field. We leverage the 0.3 deg$^{2}$ covered to date by COSMOS-3D using NIRCam/WFSS F444W (90% of the survey) to perform the largest spectroscopic search for [OIII] emitters at 6.75<z<9.05. We present our catalogue of 237 [OIII] emitters and their associated completeness function. The inferred constraints on the [OIII] LF enable us to characterise the knee of the [OIII] LF, resulting in improved [OIII] LF constraints at z~7,8. Notably, we find evidence for an accelerated decline of the [OIII] luminosity density between z~7 and z~8, which could be expected if the metallicity of [OIII] emitters, as well as the cosmic star-formation rate density, is declining at these redshifts. We find that theoretical models that reproduce the z~7,8 [OIII] LF do not reproduce well the [OIII] equivalent width distribution, pointing to potential challenges in the modelling of[OIII] and other nebular lines in the early Universe. Finally, we provide the first constraints on the cosmic variance of [OIII] emitters, estimating at 15% the relative uncertainty for the z~7,8 [OIII] LF in the 0.3 deg$^2$ field. This estimate is in good agreement with that inferred from clustering, and shows that the [OIII] LF derived from smaller extragalactic legacy fields is strongly affected by cosmic variance. Our results highlight the fundamental role that wide-area JWST slitless surveys play to map the galaxy large-scale structure down into the reionisation era, serving as a springboard for a variety of science cases.         |

|**Abstract**|            For an interferometric array, an image of the sky can be synthesized from interferometric visibilities, which are the cross-correlations of the received electric voltages of pairs of array elements. However, to search for transient targets such as the fast radio burst (FRB), it is more convenient to use the beam-forming technique, where the real-time voltage outputs of the array elements are used to generate data streams (beams) which are sensitive to a specific direction. This is usually achieved by a weighted sum of the array element voltages, with the complex weight adjusted so that all outputs have the same phase for that direction. Alternatively, beams can also be formed from the weighted sum of the short time averaged correlation (visibility) data. We shall call these two approaches the electric voltage beam forming (EBF) and cross-correlation beam forming (XBF), respectively. All beams formed with the EBF can also be formed by the XBF method, but the latter can also generate beams which can not be generated by the former. We discuss the properties of these two kinds of beams, and the amount of computation required in each case. For an array with large number of elements, the XBF would require much more computation resource, although this is partly compensated by the fact that it allows integration over time. We study the impact of cross-coupling between array elements on the beamforming, first using a toy model, then for the case of the Tianlai Cylinder Pathfinder Array. In both cases, we find that the impact of the cross-coupling on the beam profile is relatively small. The understanding gained in this study is helpful in designing and understanding the beam-forming FRB digital backend for compact arrays such as the Tianlai array.         |

|**Abstract**|            Slitless spectroscopy eliminates the need for slits, allowing light to pass directly through a prism or grism to generate a spectral dispersion image that encompasses all celestial objects within a specified area. This technique enables highly efficient spectral acquisition. However, when processing CSST slitless spectroscopy data, the unique design of its focal plane introduces a challenge: photometric and slitless spectroscopic images do not have a one-to-one correspondence. As a result, it becomes essential to first identify and count the sources in the slitless spectroscopic images before extracting spectra. To address this challenge, we employed the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection algorithm to develop a model for detecting targets in slitless spectroscopy images. This model was trained on 1,560 simulated CSST slitless spectroscopic images. These simulations were generated from the CSST Cycle 6 and Cycle 9 main survey data products, representing the Galactic and nearby galaxy regions and the high galactic latitude regions, respectively. On the validation set, the model achieved a precision of 88.6% and recall of 90.4% for spectral lines, and 87.0% and 80.8% for zeroth-order images. In testing, it maintained a detection rate >80% for targets brighter than 21 mag (medium-density regions) and 20 mag (low-density regions) in the Galactic and nearby galaxies regions, and >70% for targets brighter than 18 mag in high galactic latitude regions.         |

|**Abstract**|            Recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, combined with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and DESY5 type Ia supernova (SN) data, indicate a significant deviation from $\Lambda$CDM, which seems to suggest that this deviation can be explained by an interaction between dark energy and dark matter. In this work, we perform a comprehensive analysis by utilizing the latest DESI DR2 BAO data in conjunction with CMB data from ACT, SPT, Planck, and WMAP, along with SN data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We consider four interacting dark energy (IDE) models with different forms of the interaction term $Q$. Our analysis indicates that CMB experiments other than Planck enhance the evidence for an interaction in the IDE models with $Q \propto \rho_{\rm de}$. In particular, when using the SPT+DESI+DESY5 data, the IDE model with $Q = \beta H_0 \rho_{\rm de}$ gives $\beta = -0.4170 \pm 0.1220$, with a deviation from zero reaching $3.4\sigma$ level. When replacing DESY5 with PantheonPlus, this deviation weakens to $2.1\sigma$ level, but remains relatively significant. Furthermore, the Bayes factors of the IDE model with $Q = \beta H_0 \rho_{\rm de}$ are positive in all cases, providing a moderate-to-strong preference over $\Lambda$CDM. Overall, our comprehensive analysis clearly suggests that the IDE models with $Q \propto \rho_{\rm de}$ (especially, $Q = \beta H_0 \rho_{\rm de}$) provide strong evidence supporting the existence of interaction and are more preferred by the current cosmological data.         |

|**Abstract**|            Magnetar X-ray Burst (MXB) is usually composed of a single pulse or multiple pulses with rapid rise and brief duration mostly observed in hard X-ray (soft gamma-ray) band. Previous work studied the temporal behavior of some magnetar bursts and employed the Fast Rise Exponential Decay (FRED) model to fit pulses of MXB. However, whether there is other kind of pulse shape has not been explored. In this study, we systematically examined light curve of MXBs from SGR J1935+2154 detected by GECAM between 2021 and 2022. We find that there are different light curve morphologies. Especially, we discover a peculiar and new pattern, Exponential Rise and Cut-Off Decay (ERCOD), which is significantly different from FRED and could be well described by a mathematical function we proposed. We find that MXBs with ERCOD shape are generally longer in duration, brighter in the peak flux, and harder in spectrum. We note that the ERCOD shape is not unique to SGR J1935+2154 but also present in other magnetars. This new light curve pattern may imply a special burst and radiation mechanism of magnetar.         |

|**Abstract**|            To better understand the characteristics, driving mechanisms, and potential heating contributions of chromospheric jets, we analyze two contrasting types: one originating from within the sunspot penumbra (inside jets), and the other originating from outside the penumbra (outside jets). Statistical analysis of 100 jets (50 inside jets and 50 outside jets) reveals that inside jets have a projected velocity range of 4--14~km\,s$^{-1}$, a length range of 1--4~Mm, a width range of 0.2--0.6~Mm, and a lifetime range of 135--450~s, with mean values of 7.90~km\,s$^{-1}$, 2.61~Mm, 0.41~Mm, and 260~s, respectively. About 52\% of inside jets are associated with brightenings in H$\alpha$ blue wing images, and some show high-temperature signatures, suggesting a connection with localized energy release. In contrast, outside jets have higher velocities (8--50~km\,s$^{-1}$, average 19.04~km\,s$^{-1}$), greater lengths (average 6.26~Mm, up to 27.27~Mm), slightly larger widths (average 0.46~Mm), and longer lifetimes (135--630~s, average 327~s). They typically originate from regions of opposite magnetic polarities and are associated with magnetic flux emergence and EUV brightenings. Some outside jets correspond to coronal jets with inverted Y-shaped structures and temperatures exceeding one million Kelvin. Our results suggest that both jet types are driven by magnetic reconnection occurring in distinct magnetic field configurations and contribute to chromospheric and coronal heating.         |

|**Abstract**|            Giant planets orbiting low-mass stars on short orbits present a conundrum, as in the most extreme cases their existence cannot be reconciled with current models of core accretion. Therefore, surveys dedicated to finding these rare planets have a key role to play by growing the sample to overcome small number statistics. In this work we present MANGOS, a programme dedicated to the search for giant objects (planets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stars) orbiting M dwarfs. We report on the discovery of five new giant planets (TOI-3288 Ab, TOI-4666 b, TOI-5007 b, TOI-5292 Ab, TOI-5916 b) first detected by TESS, and confirmed using ground-based photometry and spectroscopy. The five planets have radii in the range 0.99-1.12 $\mathrm{R_{Jup}}$, masses between 0.49--1.69~$\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$, and orbital periods between 1.43 and 2.91 days. We reveal that TOI-3288 and TOI-5292 are wide binaries, and in the case of TOI-5292 we are able to characterise both stellar components. We demonstrate that the planets presented are suitable for further characterisation of their obliquities and atmospheres. We detect a small but significant eccentricity for TOI-5007 b, although for this to be more robust, more observations are needed to fully sample the orbit. Finally, we reveal a correlation between stellar metallicity and planet bulk density for giant planets orbiting low-mass stars.         |
