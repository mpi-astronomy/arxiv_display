|**Abstract**| Cygnus X is one of the closest and most active high-mass star-forming regions in our Galaxy, making it one of the best laboratories for studying massive star formation. As part of the GLOSTAR Galactic plane survey, we performed large scale simultaneous H$_{2}$CO (1$_{1,0}$-1$_{1,1}$) spectral line and radio continuum imaging observations toward Cygnus X at $\lambda\sim$6 cm with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and the Effelsberg-100 m radio telescope. Our Effelsberg observations reveal widespread H$_{2}$CO (1$_{1,0}$-1$_{1,1}$) absorption with a spatial extent of $\gtrsim$50 pc in Cygnus~X for the first time. On large scales of 4.4 pc, the relative orientation between local velocity gradient and magnetic field tends to be more parallel at H$_{2}$ column densities of $\gtrsim$1.8$\times 10^{22}$~cm$^{-2}$. On the smaller scale of 0.17 pc, our VLA+Effelsberg combined data reveal H$_{2}$CO absorption only toward three bright H{\scriptsize II} regions. Our observations demonstrate that H$_{2}$CO (1$_{1,0}$-1$_{1,1}$) is commonly optically thin. Kinematic analysis supports the assertion that molecular clouds generally exhibit supersonic motions on scales of 0.17-4.4 pc. We show a non-negligible contribution of the cosmic microwave background radiation in producing extended absorption features in Cygnus X. Our observations suggest that H$_{2}$CO ($1_{1,0}-1_{1,1}$) can trace molecular gas with H$_{2}$ column densities of $\gtrsim 5 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. The ortho-H$_{2}$CO fractional abundance with respect to H$_{2}$ has a mean value of 7.0$\times 10^{-10}$. A comparison of velocity dispersions on different linear scales suggests that the dominant $-3$ km s$^{-1}$ velocity component in the prominent DR21 region has nearly identical velocity dispersions on scales of 0.17-4.4 pc, which deviates from the expected behavior of classic turbulence. |

|**Abstract**| Most heavy elements beyond the iron peak are synthesized via neutron capture processes. The nature of the astrophysical sites of neutron capture processes is still very unclear. In this work we explore the observational constraints of the chemical abundances of s-process and r-process elements on the sites of neutron-capture processes by applying Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models to the data from Gaia-ESO large spectroscopic stellar survey. For the r-process, the [Eu/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution suggests a short delay time of the site that produces Eu. Other independent observations (e.g., NS-NS binaries), however, suggest a significant fraction of long delayed ($>1$Gyr) neutron star mergers (NSM). When assuming NSM as the only r-process sites, these two observational constraints are inconsistent at above 1$\sigma$ level. Including short delayed r-process sites like magneto-rotational supernova can resolve this inconsistency. For the s-process, we find a weak metallicity dependence of the [Ba/Y] ratio, which traces the s-process efficiency. Our GCE model with up-to-date yields of AGB stars qualitatively reproduces this metallicity dependence, but the model predicts a much higher [Ba/Y] ratio compared to the data. This mismatch suggests that the s-process efficiency of low mass AGB stars in the current AGB nucleosynthesis models could be overestimated. |

|| R. Maiolino, et al. -- incl., <mark>A. d. Graaff</mark> |

|**Abstract**| We present 12 new AGN at 4<z<7 in the JADES survey (in addition to the previously identified AGN in GN-z11 at z=10.6) revealed through the detection of a Broad Line Region as seen in the Balmer emission lines. The depth of JADES, together with the use of three different spectral resolutions, enables us to probe a lower mass regime relative to previous studies. In a few cases we find evidence for two broad components of Halpha which suggests that these could be candidate merging black holes (BHs). The inferred BH masses range between 8 x 10^7 Msun down to 4 x 10^5 Msun, interestingly probing the regime expected for Direct Collapse Black Holes. The inferred AGN bolometric luminosities (~10^44-10^45 erg/s) imply accretion rates that are < 0.5 times the Eddington rate in most cases. However, small BH, with M_BH ~ 10^6 Msun, tend to accrete at Eddington or super-Eddington rates. These BH at z~4-11 are over-massive relative to their host galaxies stellar masses when compared to the local M_BH-Mstar relation. However, we find that these early BH tend to be more consistent with the local relation between M_BH and velocity dispersion, as well as between M_BH and dynamical mass, suggesting that these are more fundamental and universal relations. On the BPT excitation-diagnostic diagram these AGN are located in the region that is that is locally occupied by star-forming galaxies, implying that they would be missed by the standard classification techniques if they did not display broad lines. Their location on the diagram is consistent with what expected for AGN hosted in metal poor galaxies (Z ~ 0.1-0.2 Zsun). The fraction of broad line AGN with L_AGN > 10^44 erg/s, among galaxies in the redshift range 4<z<6, is about 10%, suggesting that the contribution of AGN and their hosts to the reionization of the Universe is > 10%. |

|**Abstract**| On Earth, the development of technology required easy access to open air combustion, which is only possible when oxygen partial pressure, P(O$_2$), is above 18\%. This suggests that only planets with significant atmospheric oxygen concentrations will be capable of developing ``advanced'' technospheres and hence detectable technosignatures. |
