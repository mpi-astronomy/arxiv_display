|**Abstract**|            We present a multi-wavelength analysis, from the radio to the X-ray band, of the redshift $z=6.44$ VIK J2318$-$31 radio-loud (RL) quasi stellar object (QSO), one of the most distant currently known in this class. The work is based on newly obtained (uGMRT, ATCA, Chandra) as well as archival (GNIRS and X-Shooter) dedicated observations that have not been published yet. Based on the observed X-ray and radio emission, its relativistic jets are likely young and misaligned from our line of sight. Moreover, we can confirm, with simultaneous observations, the presence of a turnover in the radio spectrum at $\nu_{\rm peak} \sim 650$ MHz which is unlikely to be associated with self-synchrotron absorption. From the NIR spectrum we derived the mass of the central black hole, M$_{\rm BH}=8.1^{+6.8}_{-5.6} \times 10^8 {\rm M_{\odot}}$, and the Eddington ratio, $\lambda_{\rm EDD} = 0.8^{+0.8}_{-0.6}$, using broad emission lines as well as an accretion disc model fit to the continuum emission. Given the high accretion rate, the presence of a $\sim$8$\times$10$^8$ M$_\odot$ black hole at $z=6.44$ can be explained by a seed black hole ($\sim$10$^{4}$ M$_\odot$) that formed at $z\sim25$, assuming a radiative efficiency $\eta_{\rm d}\sim0.1$. However, by assuming $\eta_{\rm d}\sim0.3$, as expected for jetted systems, the mass observed would challenge current theoretical models of black hole formation.         |

|**Abstract**|            Joint analysis of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurement by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) first data release, Type Ia supernovae (SNe) of the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DES5YR) release and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data favors a quintom-like dynamic dark energy model over the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model at $3.9\sigma$ level (Adame et al. 2024). We demonstrate that the preference for dynamic dark energy does not rely on the detailed modeling of CMB physics and remains at $3.2\sigma$ level when the full CMB likelihood is replaced by a CMB acoustic-oscillation angle ($\theta_\star$) prior and a baryon abundance ($\Omega_bh^2$) prior. By comparing the data with over $10^4$ $\Lambda$CDM-based simulations, we find that both the SNe and BAO data contribute significantly to the preference for dynamic dark energy. The preference for dynamic dark energy is unlikely (probability $\lesssim 0.02$) due to unknown systematics in DES5YR SNe and statistical fluctuations in DESI BAO, or vice versa.         |

|**Abstract**|            We have learnt in the last decades that the majority of galaxies belong to high density regions interconnected in a sponge-like fashion. This large-scale structure is characterised by clusters, filaments, walls, where most galaxies concentrate, but also under-dense regions, called voids. The void regions and the galaxies within represent an ideal place for the study of galaxy formation and evolution as they are largely unaffected by the complex physical processes that transform galaxies in high-density environments. These void galaxies can hold the key as well to answer current challenges to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY) is a Legacy project approved by the Calar Alto Observatory to obtain spatially resolved spectroscopic information of $\sim300$ void galaxies in the Local Universe (0.005 < z < 0.050) covering from -17.0 to -21.5 in $\rm r$ band absolute magnitude. It officially started in January 2021 and has been awarded 110 useful dark observing nights at the 3.5 m telescope using the PMAS spectrograph. Complementary follow-up projects including deep optical imaging, integrated, as well as resolved CO data, and integrated HI spectra, have joint the PMAS observations and naturally complete the scientific aim of characterising galaxies in cosmic voids. The extension data has been denominated CAVITY+. The data will be available to the whole community in different data releases, the first of which is planned for July 2024, and it will provide the community with PMAS data cubes for around 100 void galaxies through a user friendly, and well documented, database platform. We present here the survey, sample selection, data reduction, quality control schemes, science goals, and some examples of the scientific power of the CAVITY and CAVITY+ data.         |
