|**Abstract**|            We combine James Webb Space Telescope images of the nearby galaxy NGC 5194 in the hydrogen recombination line Pa-alpha (lambda=1.8756 micron) from the Cycle 1 program JWST-FEAST with 21 micron dust continuum images from the Cycle 2 Treasury program JWGT to quantify the difference in the calibration of mid-infrared star formation rates (SFR) between HII regions and galaxies. We use the archival HST H-alpha image to correct the Pa-alpha emission for the effects of dust attenuation. Our data confirm previous results that the dust-corrected Pa-alpha flux is tightly correlated with the 21 micron emission at the scales of HII regions. When combined with published JWST data for the HII regions of the galaxy NGC 628 and Spitzer 24 micron data for whole galaxies and for kpc-size galaxy regions, we show that the L(24)-L(Pa-alpha) correlation has exponent >1 across six decades in luminosity. In addition, the hybrid 24 micron+H-alpha SFR indicator has a scaling constant about 4.4 times higher for HII regions than for whole galaxies, also in agreement with previous results. Models of stellar populations with a range of star formation histories reveal that the observed trends can be entirely ascribed to and quantified with the contribution to the IR emission by stellar populations older than ~5-6 Myr. Based on the models' results, we provide: (1) a calibration for the infrared SFR across six orders of magnitude in L(24), from HII regions to luminous galaxies, and (2) a prescription for the scaling constant of the hybrid infrared SFR indicators as a function of the star formation timescale.         |

|| Y. Zhang, et al. -- incl., <mark>A. d. Graaff</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            We present the number density of massive ($ \mathrm{ log (M_{*}/M_{\odot}) > 10.3} $) quiescent galaxies at $2<z<5$ using JWST NIRSpec PRISM spectra. This work relies on spectra from RUBIES, which provides excellent data quality and an unparalleled, well-defined targeting strategy to robustly infer physical properties and number densities. We identify quiescent galaxy candidates within RUBIES through principal component analysis and construct a final sample using star formation histories derived from spectro-photometric fitting of the NIRSpec PRISM spectra and NIRCam photometry. By inverting the RUBIES selection function, we correct for survey incompleteness and calculate the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at these redshifts, providing the most complete spectroscopic estimates prior to cosmic noon to date. We find that early massive quiescent galaxies are surprisingly common ($\gtrsim 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ by $4<z<5$), which is consistent with previous studies based on JWST photometry alone and/or in smaller survey areas. We compare our number densities with predictions from six state-of-the-art cosmological galaxy formation simulations. At $z>3$, most simulations fail to produce enough massive quiescent galaxies, suggesting the treatment of feedback and/or the channels for early efficient formation are incomplete in most galaxy evolution models.         |

|| D. Gonzalez-Buitrago, et al. -- incl., <mark>S. Vaughan</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-08-13*|

|**Abstract**|            We present ground-based, multi-band light curves of the AGN Mrk~509, NGC\,4151, and NGC\,4593 obtained contemporaneously with \sw\, monitoring. We measure cross-correlation lags relative to \sw\, UVW2 (1928~Ã…) and test the standard prediction for disk reprocessing, which assumes a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk where continuum interband delays follow the relation \( \tau(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{4/3} \). For Mrk~509 the 273-d \sw\, campaign gives well-defined lags that increase with wavelength as $\tau(\lambda)\propto\lambda^{2.17\pm0.2}$, steeper than the thin-disk prediction, and the optical lags are a factor of $\sim5$ longer than expected for a simple disk-reprocessing model. This ``disk-size discrepancy'' as well as excess lags in the $u$ and $r$ bands (which include the Balmer continuum and H$\alpha$, respectively) suggest a mix of short lags from the disk and longer lags from nebular continuum originating in the broad-line region. The shorter \sw\, campaigns, 69~d on NGC\,4151 and 22~d on NGC\,4593, yield less well-defined, shorter lags $<2$~d. The NGC\,4593 lags are consistent with $\tau(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{4/3}$ but with uncertainties too large for a strong test. For NGC\,4151 the \sw\, lags match $\tau(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{4/3}$, with a small $U$-band excess, but the ground-based lags in the $r$, $i$, and $z$ bands are significantly shorter than the $B$ and $g$ lags, and also shorter than expected from the thin-disk prediction. The interpretation of this unusual lag spectrum is unclear. Overall these results indicate significant diversity in the $\tau-\lambda$ relation across the optical/UV/NIR, which differs from the more homogeneous behavior seen in the \sw\, bands.         |

|**Abstract**|            Large-scale solar eruptions are generally accepted to have coronal magnetic flux ropes as their core structures. Recent studies found that the solar eruptions could be initiated by a sequence of flux feeding processes, during with chromospheric fibrils rise and merge with the pre-existing coronal flux rope. Further theoretical analyses have demonstrated that the normal flux feeding, i.e. the axial magnetic flux within the fibril is in the same direction as that in the flux rope, results in the accumulation of the total axial flux within the flux rope, so as to initiate the eruption. If the directions of the axial flux in the fibril and the flux rope are opposite, it is termed inverse flux feeding, whose influence on coronal flux ropes, however, is still unclear. In this paper, we use a 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model to simulate the evolution of coronal flux ropes associated with inverse flux feeding. It is found that inverse flux feeding is also efficient in causing solar eruptions: although the total signed axial magnetic flux of the rope decreases after inverse flux feeding, the total unsigned axial flux can accumulate; the eruption occurs if the unsigned axial flux of the rope reaches a critical value, which is almost the same as the threshold for normal flux feeding. The total axial currents within the rope are also similar during the onset of the eruptions caused by both normal and inverse flux feeding. Our simulation results suggest that it is the unsigned axial magnetic flux rather than the signed axial flux that regulates the onset of coronal flux rope eruptions.         |

|| X. Chen, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Shi</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            A major challenge in understanding the initiation and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is measuring the magnetic field of the magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) that drive CMEs. Recent developments in radio imaging spectroscopy have paved the way for diagnosing the CMEs' magnetic field using gyrosynchrotron radiation. We present magnetic field measurements of a CME associated with an X5-class flare by combining radio imaging spectroscopy data in microwaves (1--18 GHz) and meter-wave (20--88 MHz), obtained by the Owens Valley Radio Observatory's Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) and Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA), respectively. EOVSA observations reveal that the microwave source, observed in the low corona during the initiation phase of the eruption, outlines the bottom of the rising MFR-hosting CME bubble seen in extreme ultraviolet and expands as the bubble evolves. As the MFR erupts into the middle corona and appears as a white light CME, its meter-wave counterpart, observed by OVRO-LWA, displays a similar morphology. For the first time, using gyrosynchrotron spectral diagnostics, we obtain magnetic field measurements of the erupting MFR in both the low and middle corona, corresponding to coronal heights of 1.02 and 2.83 $R_{\odot}$. The magnetic field strength is found to be around 300 G at 1.02 $R_{\odot}$ during the CME initiation, and about 0.6 G near the leading edge of the CME when it propagates to 2.83 $R_{\odot}$. These results provide critical new insights into the magnetic structure of the CME and its evolution during the early stages of its eruption.         |
