|**Abstract**|            We report on coronagraphic observations of the nearest solar-type star, $\alpha$ Cen A, using the MIRI instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope. With three epochs of observation (August 2024, February 2025, and April 2025), we achieve a sensitivity sufficient to detect $T_{\rm eff}\approx$ 225-250 K (1-1.2 $R_{\rm Jup}$) planets between 1"-2" and exozodiacal dust emission at the level of $>$5-8$\times$ the brightness of our own zodiacal cloud. The lack of exozodiacal dust emission sets an unprecedented limit of a few times the brightness of our own zodiacal cloud$-$a factor of $\gtrsim$10 more sensitive than measured toward any other stellar system to date. In August 2024, we detected a F$_\nu$(15.5 $\mu$m) = 3.5 mJy point source, called $S1$, at a separation of 1.5" from $\alpha$ Cen A. Because the August 2024 epoch had only one successful observation at a single roll angle, it is not possible to unambiguously confirm $S1$ as a bona fide planet. Our analysis confirms that $S1$ is neither a background nor a foreground object. $S1$ is not recovered in the February and April 2025 epochs. However, if $S1$ is the counterpart of the object, $C1$, seen by the VLT/NEAR program in 2019, we find that there is a 52% chance that the $S1+C1$ candidate was missed in both follow-up JWST/MIRI observations due to orbital motion. Incorporating constraints from the non-detections, we obtain families of dynamically stable orbits for $S1+C1$ with periods between 2-3 years. These suggest that the planet candidate is on an eccentric ($e \approx 0.4$) orbit significantly inclined with respect to $\alpha$ Cen AB orbital plane ($i_{\rm mutual} \approx 50^\circ$, or $\approx 130^\circ$). Based on the photometry and orbital properties, the planet candidate could have a temperature of 225 K, a radius of $\approx$1-1.1 $R_{\rm Jup}$ and a mass between 90-150 $M_{\rm Earth}$, consistent with RV limits.         |

|**Abstract**|            The inner regions of protoplanetary disks, within ten astronomical units, are where terrestrial planets are born. By developing a new class of multi-dust radiative magnetized inner rim models, we can gain valuable insights into the conditions during planet formation. Our goal is twofold: to study the influence of highly refractory dust species on the inner rim shape and to determine how the magnetic field affects the inner disk structure. The resulting temperature and density structures are analyzed and compared to observations. The comparison focuses on a median SED of Herbig stars and interferometric constraints from the H, K, and N-band of three Herbig-type star-disk systems: HD 100546, HD 163296, and HD 169142. We investigate 1) the influence of a large-scale magnetic field on the inner disk structure and 2) the effect of having the four most important dust species (corundum, iron, forsterite, and enstatite) shaping the rim. We use frequency-dependent irradiation and the effect of accretion heating. With the Optool package, we obtain frequency-dependent opacities for each dust grain family and calculate the corresponding temperature-dependent Planck and Rosseland opacities. Our models with multiple dust species show a smoother and radially more extended inner rim. Strongly magnetized disks show a substantial increase in the emission flux between the L and N-bands. Weakly magnetized disk models with large-scale vertical magnetic fields < 0.3 Gauss at 1 au best fit with NIR interferometric observations. Our model comparison supports the existence of moderate magnetic fields ($\beta$ > $10^4$), which could still drive a magnetic wind in the inner disk. Our results show that multi-dust models, including magnetic fields, still lack NIR emission, especially in the H-band. One potential solution might be a heated gas disk or evaporating objects like planetesimals close to the star.         |

|**Abstract**|            The chemical composition of the inner regions of disks around young stars will determine the properties of planets forming there. Many disk physical processes drive the chemical evolution, some of which depend on/correlate with the stellar properties. We aim to explore the connection between stellar properties and inner disk chemistry, using mid-infrared spectroscopy. We use JWST-MIRI observations of a large, diverse sample of sources to explore trends between C$_2$H$_2$ and H$_2$O. Additionally, we calculate the average spectrum for the T Tauri ($M_{*}$$>$0.2 $M_{\odot}$) and very low-mass star (VLMS, $M_{*}$$\leq$0.2 $M_{\odot}$) samples and use slab models to determine the properties. We find a significant anti-correlation between the flux ratio of C$_2$H$_2$/H$_2$O and the stellar luminosity. Disks around VLMS have significantly higher $F_{\rm{C_2H_2}}$/$F_{\rm{H_2O}}$ flux ratios than their higher-mass counterparts. We also explore trends with the strength of the 10 $\mu$m silicate feature, stellar accretion rate, and disk dust mass, all of which show correlations with the flux ratio, which may be related to processes driving the carbon-enrichment in disks around VLMS, but also have degeneracies with system properties. Slab model fits to the average spectra show that the VLMS H$_2$O emission is quite similar in temperature and column density to a warm ($\sim$600 K) H$_2$O component in the T Tauri spectrum, indicating that the high C/O gas phase ratio in these disks is not due to oxygen depletion alone. Instead, the presence of many hydrocarbons, including some with high column densities, points to carbon enhancement in the disks around VLMS. The observed differences in the inner disk chemistry as a function of host properties are likely to be accounted for by differences in the disk temperatures, stellar radiation field, and the evolution of dust grains.         |

|| <mark>B. Saha</mark>, S. Dutta, A. Banerjee |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-08-07*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal*|
|**Abstract**|            About two-thirds of disk galaxies host spiral arms, ranging from well-delineated grand-design spirals to fragmented flocculent spiral galaxies. We introduce fractal dimension $D_B$ as a non-parametric measure to distinguish between grand-designs and flocculents. We calculate the $D_B$ of 197 grand-designs and 322 flocculents from SDSS DR18, using the samples of \citet{Buta..2015} and \citet{Sarkar..2023}. Our calculated median values of $D_B$ are $1.29^{+0.06}_{-0.04}$ and $1.38^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$ for the grand-designs and flocculents, respectively. In addition, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test rejects null hypothesis that these distributions are drawn from the same population. Finally, using a Random Forest (RF) model, we compare the effectiveness of $D_B$ in classifying spiral arm morphology, as compared to five other parameters viz. total atomic hydrogen HI mass $M_{HI}$, ratio of atomic hydrogen mass-to-blue luminosity $M_{HI} /L_B$, concentration index $C_i$, clumpiness $S$ and arm-contrast $C$. Our results indicate that $D_B$ has the highest feature index (30.8\%), followed by $C_i$ (26.0\%) and $M_{HI}$ (21.0\%). In fact, C, the metric routinely used to distinguish between the spiral morphologies has a feature importance of 8.3\%. Further, $D_B$ for grand-designs is found to anti-correlate with the central velocity dispersion with a correlation coefficient of -0.3 and $p \ll 0.05$. A high value of central velocity dispersion indicates a central Q-barrier, which favors the formation of grand designs according to the density wave theory. Thus, fractal dimension serves as a robust metric to distinguish between spiral morphologies and also links to the formation mechanism of spiral features.         |
