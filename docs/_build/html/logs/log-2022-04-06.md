|| Jane Huang, et al. -- incl., <mark>Paola Pinilla</mark>, <mark>Jonathan P. Williams</mark> |

|**Abstract**| While protoplanetary disks are often treated as isolated systems in planet formation models, observations increasingly suggest that vigorous interactions between Class II disks and their environments are not rare. DO Tau is a T Tauri star that has previously been hypothesized to have undergone a close encounter with the HV Tau system. As part of the DESTINYS ESO Large Programme, we present new VLT/SPHERE polarimetric observations of DO Tau and combine them with archival HST scattered light images and ALMA observations of CO isotopologues and CS to map a network of complex structures. The SPHERE and ALMA observations show that the circumstellar disk is connected to arms extending out to several hundred au. HST and ALMA also reveal stream-like structures northeast of DO Tau, some of which are at least several thousand au long. These streams appear not to be gravitationally bound to DO Tau, and comparisons with previous Herschel far-IR observations suggest that the streams are part of a bridge-like structure connecting DO Tau and HV Tau. We also detect a fainter redshifted counterpart to a previously known blueshifted CO outflow. While some of DO Tau's complex structures could be attributed to a recent disk-disk encounter, they might be explained alternatively by interactions with remnant material from the star formation process. These panchromatic observations of DO Tau highlight the need to contextualize the evolution of Class II disks by examining processes occurring over a wide range of size scales. |

|**Abstract**| This work is part of a multi-wavelength program to study the effects of X-ray/UV/optical stellar radiation on the chemistry of the circumbinary disk around the young high-eccentricity binary DQ Tau. ALMA observations for near/around December 5, 2021 periastron were postponed due to bad weather, but supporting Swift-XRT-UVOT TOO observations were successful. These Swift observations along with previous X-ray-optical-mm data show that DQ Tau keeps exhibiting powerful flares near periastron, offering a unique laboratory for studies of flare effects on the gas-phase ion chemistry in protoplanetary disks. |

|**Abstract**| We report the complete statistical planetary sample from the prime fields ($\Gamma \geq 2~{\rm hr}^{-1}$) of the 2019 Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) microlensing survey. We develop the optimized KMTNet AnomalyFinder algorithm and apply it to the 2019 KMTNet prime fields. We find a total of 14 homogeneously selected planets and report the analysis of three planetary events, KMT-2019-BLG-(1042,1552,2974). The planet-host mass ratios, $q$, for the three planetary events are $6.34 \times 10^{-4}, 4.89 \times 10^{-3}$ and $6.18 \times 10^{-4}$, respectively. A Bayesian analysis indicates the three planets are all cold giant planets beyond the snow line of their host stars. The 14 planets are basically uniform in $\log q$ over the range $-5.0 < \log q < -1.5$. This result suggests that the planets below $q_{\rm break} = 1.7 \times 10^{-4}$ proposed by the MOA-II survey may be more common than previously believed. This work is an early component of a large project to determine the KMTNet mass-ratio function, and the whole sample of 2016--2019 KMTNet events should contain about 120 planets. |

|| Á. Martínez-Arranz, R. Schödel, <mark>F. Nogueras-Lara</mark>, B. Shahzamanian |
|*Comments*| *5 pages, 5 figures*|
|**Abstract**| Context. The central molecular zone at the Galactic center is currently being studied intensively to understand how star formation proceeds under the extreme conditions of a galactic nucleus. Knowing the position of molecular clouds along the line of sight toward the Galactic center has had important implications in our understanding of the physics of the gas and star formation in the central molecular zone.It was recently claimed that the dense molecular cloud G0.253 + 0.016 (the Brick) has a distance of $\sim$7.20 kpc from the Sun. That would place it outside of the central molecular zone, and therefore of the nuclear stellar disk, but still inside the Bulge. Aims. Theoretical considerations as well as observational studies show that stars that belong to the nuclear stellar disk have different kinematics from those that belong to the inner Bulge. Therefore, we aim to constrain the distance to the Brick by studying the proper motions of the stars in the area. Results. The stellar population seen toward the nuclear stellar disk shows the following three kinematic components: 1) Bulge stars with an isotropic velocity dispersion of $\sim$3.5 micro-arc second per year; 2) eastward moving stars on the near side of the nuclear stellar disk; and 3) westward moving stars on the far side of the nuclear stellar disk. We clearly see all three components toward the comparison field. However, toward the Brick, which blocks the light from stars behind it, we can only see kinematic components 1) and 2). Conclusions. While the Brick blocks the light from stars on the far side of the nuclear stellar disk, the detection of a significant component of eastward streaming stars implies that the Brick must be located inside the nuclear stellar disk and, therefore, that it forms part of the central molecular zone. |

|| Dominic J. Taylor, et al. -- incl., <mark>Domingo Aníbal García-Hernández</mark> |
|*Comments*| *15 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication by MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**| It has been proposed that the globular cluster-like system Terzan 5 is the surviving remnant of a primordial building block of the Milky Way bulge, mainly due to the age/metallicity spread and the distribution of its stars in the $\alpha$-Fe plane. We employ Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE 2) to test this hypothesis. Adopting a random sampling technique, we contrast the abundances of 10 elements in Terzan 5 stars with those of their bulge field counterparts with comparable atmospheric parameters, finding that they differ at statistically significant levels. Abundances between the two groups differ by more than 1$\sigma$ in Ca, Mn, C, O, and Al, and more than 2$\sigma$ in Si and Mg. Terzan 5 stars have lower [$\alpha$/Fe] and higher [Mn/Fe] than their bulge counterparts. Given those differences, we conclude that Terzan 5 is not the remnant of a $major$ building block of the bulge. We also estimate the stellar mass of the Terzan 5 progenitor based on predictions by the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) suite of cosmological numerical simulations, concluding that it may have been as low as $\sim3\times10^8$ M$_\odot$ so that it was likely unable to significantly influence the mean chemistry of the bulge/inner disk, which is significantly more massive ($\sim10^{10}$ M$_\odot$). We briefly discuss existing scenarios for the nature of Terzan 5 and propose an observational test that may help elucidate its origin. |

|| Guo-Jian Wang, et al. -- incl., <mark>Hong-Liang Shi</mark> |
|*Comments*| *19 pages, 25 figures, and 3 tables, ApJS, in press. The code repository is available at this https URL*|
|**Abstract**| The cosmic microwave background (CMB), carrying the inhomogeneous information of the very early universe, is of great significance for understanding the origin and evolution of our universe. However, observational CMB maps contain serious foreground contaminations from several sources, such as galactic synchrotron and thermal dust emissions. Here, we build a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to recover the tiny CMB signal from various huge foreground contaminations. Focusing on the CMB temperature fluctuations, we find that the CNN model can successfully recover the CMB temperature maps with high accuracy, and that the deviation of the recovered power spectrum $C_\ell$ is smaller than the cosmic variance at $\ell>10$. We then apply this method to the current Planck observation, and find that the recovered CMB is quite consistent with that disclosed by the Planck collaboration, which indicates that the CNN method can provide a promising approach to the component separation of CMB observations. Furthermore, we test the CNN method with simulated CMB polarization maps based on the CMB-S4 experiment. The result shows that both the EE and BB power spectra can be recovered with high accuracy. Therefore, this method will be helpful for the detection of primordial gravitational waves in current and future CMB experiments. The CNN is designed to analyze two-dimensional images, thus this method is not only able to process full-sky maps, but also partial-sky maps. Therefore, it can also be used for other similar experiments, such as radio surveys like the Square Kilometer Array. |

|| Hannah Richstein, et al. -- incl., <mark>Andrew Wetzel</mark>, <mark>Mattia Libralato</mark> |
|*Comments*| *18 pages, 11 figures; submitted to ApJ*|
|**Abstract**| We present deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry of the ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies Pegasus III (Peg III) and Pisces II (Psc II), two of the most distant satellites in the halo of the Milky Way (MW). We measure the structure of both galaxies, derive mass-to-light ratios with newly determined absolute magnitudes, and compare our findings to expectations from UFD-mass simulations. For Peg III, we find an elliptical half-light radius of $a_h{{=}}1.88^{+0.42}_{-0.33}$ arcminutes ($118^{+31}_{-30}$ pc) and $M_V{=}{-4.17}^{+0.19}_{-0.22}$; for Psc II, we measure $a_h{=}1.31^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$ arcminutes ($69\pm8$ pc) and $M_V{=}{-4.28}^{+0.19}_{-0.16}$. We do not find any morphological features that indicate a significant interaction between the two has occurred, despite their close separation of only $\sim$40 kpc. Using proper motions (PMs) from Gaia early Data Release 3, we investigate the possibility of any past association by integrating orbits for the two UFDs in a MW-only and a combined MW and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) potential. We find that including the gravitational influence of the LMC is crucial, even for these outer-halo satellites, and that a possible orbital history exists where Peg III and Psc II experienced a close ($\sim$10-20 kpc) passage about each other just over $\sim$1 Gyr ago, followed by a collective passage around the LMC ($\sim$30-60 kpc) just under $\sim$1 Gyr ago. Considering the large uncertainties on the PMs and the restrictive priors imposed to derive them, improved PM measurements for Peg III and Psc II will be necessary to clarify their relationship. This would add to the rare findings of confirmed pairs of satellites within the Local Group. |

Morphology of the Planetary  Radius Valley as a Function of Stellar Age and Metallicity in the Galactic  Context Revealed by the LAMOST-Gaia-Kepler Sample**  |
|| Di-Chang Chen, et al. -- incl., <mark>Ji Wei Xie</mark> |
|*Comments*| *Accepted for pubilication in AJ, 20 Pages, 10 figures, 2 Tables (Appendix: 13 Figures)*|
|**Abstract**| The radius valley, a dip in the radius distribution of exoplanets at ~1.9 Earth radii separates compact rocky Super-Earths and Sub-Neptunes with lower density. Various hypotheses have been put forward to explain the radius valley. Characterizing the radius valley morphology and its correlation to stellar properties will provide crucial observation constraints on its origin mechanism and deepen the understanding of planet formation and evolution. In this paper, the third part of the Planets Across the Space and Time (PAST) series, using the LAMOST-Gaia-Kepler catalog, we perform a systematical investigation into how the radius valley morphology varies in the Galactic context, i.e., thin/thick galactic disks, stellar age and metallicity abundance ([Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe]). We find that (1) The valley becomes more prominent with the increase of both age and [Fe/H]. (2) The number ratio of super-Earths to sub-Neptunes monotonically increases with age but decreases with [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe]. (3) The average radius of planets above the valley (2.1-6 Earth radii) decreases with age but increases with [Fe/H]. (4) In contrast, the average radius of planets below the valley (R < 1.7 Earth radii) is broadly independent on age and metallicity. Our results demonstrate that the valley morphology as well as the whole planetary radius distribution evolves on a long timescale of giga-years, and metallicities (not only Fe but also other metal elements, e.g., Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) play important roles in planet formation and in the long term planetary evolution. |

|| <mark>Xia Zhang</mark>, Foivos I. Diakogiannis, Richard Dodson, Andreas Wicenec |
|*Comments*| *16 pages, 8 figures, to appear in AJ*|
|**Abstract**| For transient sources with timescales of 1-100 seconds, standardized imaging for all observations at each time step become impossible as large modern interferometers produce significantly large data volumes in this observation time frame. Here we propose a method based on machine learning and using interferometric closure products as input features to detect transient source candidates directly from the spatial frequency domain without imaging. We train a simple neural network classifier on a synthetic dataset of Noise/Transient/RFI events, which we construct to tackle the lack of labelled data. We also use the hyper-parameter dropout rate of the model to allow the model to approximate Bayesian inference, and select the optimal dropout rate to match the posterior prediction to the actual underlying probability distribution of the detected events. The overall F1-score of the classifier on the simulated dataset is greater than 85\%, with the signal-to-noise at 7$\sigma$. The performance of the trained neural network with Monte Carlo dropout is evaluated on semi-real data, which includes a simulated transient source and real noise. This classifier accurately identifies the presence of transient signals in the detectable signal-to-noise levels (above 4$\sigma$) with the optimal variance. Our findings suggest that a feasible radio transient classifier can be built up with only simulated data for applying to the prediction of real observation, even in the absence of annotated real samples for the purpose of training. |

|| Jonathan A. Blazek, et al. -- incl., <mark>Katrin Heitmann</mark>, <mark>Joel Meyers</mark> |
|*Comments*| *White paper submitted to the Proceedings of the US Community Study on the Future of Particle Physics (Snowmass 2021)*|
|**Abstract**| A new generation of powerful dark energy experiments will open new vistas for cosmology in the next decade. However, these projects cannot reach their utmost potential without data from other telescopes. This white paper focuses in particular on the compelling benefits of ground-based spectroscopic and photometric observations to complement the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, as well as smaller programs in aid of a DESI-2 experiment and CMB-S4. These additional data sets will both improve dark energy constraints from these flagship projects beyond what would possible on their own and open completely new windows into fundamental physics. For example, additional photometry and single-object spectroscopy will provide necessary follow-up information for supernova and strong lensing cosmology, while highly-multiplexed spectroscopy both from smaller facilities over wide fields and from larger facilities over narrower regions of sky will yield more accurate photometric redshift estimates for weak lensing and galaxy clustering measurements from the Rubin Observatory, provide critical spectroscopic host galaxy redshifts for supernova Hubble diagrams, provide improved understanding of limiting astrophysical systematic effects, and enable new measurements that probe the nature of gravity. A common thread is that access to complementary data from a range of telescopes/instruments would have a substantial impact on the rate of advance of dark energy science in the coming years. |

|| <mark>Zhang Bing-Kai</mark>, Zhao Xiao-Yun, Wu Qi |
|*Comments*| *38 pages, 56 figures, 1 table*|
|**Abstract**| We have investigated the optical spectral behavior of a large sample of Fermi blazars (40 FSRQs and 13 BL Lacs), and found two new universal optical spectral behaviors. In the low state the optical spectrum gradually becomes softer (steeper) or harder (flatter) but more and more slowly when the brightness increases, and then tends to stable in the high state, which are briefly named the redder-stable-when-brighter (RSWB) and bluer-stable-when-brighter (BSWB) behaviors, respectively. 34 FSRQs and 7 BL Lacs exhibit clear RSWB behavior, and 2 FSRQs and 5 BL Lacs show distinct BSWB behavior, which mean that FSRQs favor more RSWB than BSWB behavior, while BL Lacs have no clear preference among both behaviors. We have put forward a unified nonlinear formula to quantitatively characterize the optical spectral behaviors of FSRQs and BL Lacs, which can fit both kinds of behaviors very well. We argue that the RSWB and BSWB behaviors originate from the same mechanism, and they are the universal optical spectral behaviors for blazars. The frequently observed redder-when-brighter (RWB) and bluer-when-brighter (BWB) trends can be considered to be the approximations of the behaviors of RSWB and BSWB, respectively. The rarely observed stable-when-brighter (SWB) trend can also be viewed as an approximation or a special case of the RSWB or BSWB behavior. We have developed a model with two constant-spectral-index components which can not only explain well both two kinds of optical spectral behaviors, but also successfully interpret the differential behaviors between FSRQs and BL Lacs. |

|| E. Bellocchi, et al. -- incl., <mark>A. Alonso-Herrero</mark>, <mark>M. Villar-Martín</mark> |
|*Comments*| *36 pages, 20 figures, 8 tables. Accepted for publication in A&A*|
|**Abstract**| We present new CO(2-1) observations of a representative sample of 24 local (z$<$0.02) luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) obtained at high spatial resolution ($<$100 pc) from ALMA. We derive the effective radii of the CO(2-1) and the 1.3 mm continuum emissions using the curve-of-growth method. LIRGs show an extremely compact cold molecular gas distribution (median R$_{CO}$ $\sim$0.7 kpc), which is a factor 2 smaller than the ionized gas, and 3.5 times smaller than the stellar size. The molecular size of LIRGs is similar to that of early-type galaxies (R$_{CO}\sim$1 kpc) and about a factor of 6 more compact than local Spirals of similar stellar mass. Only the CO emission in low-z ULIRGs is more compact than these local LIRGs by a factor of 2. Compared to high-z (1$<$z$<$6) systems, the stellar sizes and masses of local LIRGs are similar to those of high-z MS star-forming galaxies (SFG) and about a factor of 2-3 lower than sub-mm galaxies (SMG). The molecular sizes of high-z MS SFGs and SMGs are larger than those derived for LIRGs by a factor of $\sim$3 and $\sim$8, respectively. These results indicate that while low-z LIRGs and high-z MS-SFGs have similar stellar masses and sizes, the regions of current star formation (traced by the ionized gas) and of potential star-formation (traced by the molecular gas) are substantially smaller in LIRGs, and constrained to the central kpc region. High-z galaxies represent a wider population but their star-forming regions are more extended, even covering the overall size of the host galaxy. High-z galaxies have larger fractions of gas than low-z LIRGs, and therefore the formation of stars could be induced by interactions and mergers in extended disks or filaments with large enough molecular gas surface density involving physical mechanisms similar to those identified in the central kpc of LIRGs. |

|| M. Krezinger, et al. -- incl., <mark>Y. Zhang</mark> |
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**| High-redshift radio sources provide plentiful opportunities for studying the formation and evolution of early galaxies and supermassive black holes. However, the number of known radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) above redshift 4 is rather limited. At high redshifts, it appears that blazars, with relativistically beamed jets pointing towards the observer, are in majority compared to radio-loud sources with jets misaligned with respect to the line of sight. To find more of these misaligned AGN, milliarcsec-scale imaging studies carried out with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) are needed, as they allow us to distinguish between compact core--jet radio sources and those with more extended emission. Previous high-resolution VLBI studies revealed that some of the radio sources among blazar candidates in fact show unbeamed radio emission on milliarcsecond scales. The most accurate optical coordinates determined with the Gaia astrometric space mission are also useful in the classification process. Here, we report on dual-frequency imaging observations of 13 high-redshift (4 < z < 4.5) quasars at 1.7 and 5 GHz with the European VLBI Network. This sample increases the number of z>4 radio sources for which VLBI observations are available by about a quarter. Using structural and physical properties, such as radio morphology, spectral index, variability, brightness temperature, as well as optical coordinates, we identified six blazars and six misaligned radio AGNs, with the remaining one tentatively identified as blazar. |

|| G. I. Perren, M. S. Pera, H. D. Navone, <mark>R. A. Vázquez</mark> |
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in A&A*|
|**Abstract**| Several studies have been presented in the last few years applying some kind of automatic processing of data to estimate the fundamental parameters of open clusters. These parameters are later on employed in larger scale analyses, for example the structure of the Galaxy's spiral arms. The distance is one of the more straightforward parameters to estimate, yet enormous differences can still be found among published data. This is particularly true for open clusters located more than a few kpc away. We cross-matched several published catalogues and selected the twenty-five most distant open clusters ($>$9000 pc). We then performed a detailed analysis of their fundamental parameters, with emphasis on their distances, to determine the agreement between catalogues and our estimates.} Photometric and astrometric data from the Gaia EDR3 survey was employed. The data was processed with our own membership analysis code (pyUPMASK), and our package for automatic fundamental cluster's parameters estimation ($\texttt{ASteCA}$). We find differences in the estimated distances of up to several kpc between our results and those catalogued, even for the catalogues that show the best matches with $\texttt{ASteCA}$ values. Large differences are also found for the age estimates. As a by-product of the analysis we find that vd Bergh-Hagen 176 could be the open cluster with the largest heliocentric distance catalogued to date. Caution is thus strongly recommended when using catalogued parameters of open clusters to infer large-scale properties of the Galaxy, particularly for those located more than a few kpc away. |

|| Emilio D. Hueichapán, et al. -- incl., <mark>Joseph P. Anderson</mark> |
|*Comments*| *22 pages, 15 figures, Accepted for publication in MNRAs*|
|**Abstract**| We present deep optical and near-infrared photometry of UID 30901, a superluminous supernova (SLSN) discovered during the UltraVISTA survey. The observations were obtained with VIRCAM ($YJHK_{s}$) mounted on the VISTA telescope, DECam ($griz$) on the Blanco telescope, and SUBARU Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC; $grizy$). These multi-band observations comprise +700 days making UID 30901 one of the best photometrically followed SLSNe to date. The host galaxy of UID 30901 is detected in a deep HST F814W image with an AB magnitude of $27.3 \pm 0.2$. While no spectra exist for the SN or its host galaxy, we perform our analysis assuming $z = 0.37$, based on the photometric redshift of a possible host galaxy found at a projected distance of 7 kpc. Fitting a blackbody to the observations, the radius, temperature, and bolometric light curve are computed. We find a maximum bolometric luminosity of $5.4 \pm 0.34 \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. A flattening in the light curve beyond 600 days is observed and several possible causes are discussed. We find the observations to clearly favour a SLSN type I, and plausible power sources such as the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni and the spin-down of a magnetar are compared to the data. We find that the magnetar model yields a good fit to the observations with the following parameters: a magnetic field $B = 1.4 \pm 0.3 \times 10^{14} \ G$, spin period of $P = 6.0 \pm 0.1 \ ms$ and ejecta mass $M_{ej} = 11.9^{+4.8}_{-6.4} M_{\odot}$. |

|**Abstract**| Reverse shock (RS) emission can be used to probe the properties of the relativistic ejecta, especially the degree of magnetization $\sigma$, in gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows. However, there has been confusion in the literature regarding the physical condition for the RS formation, and the role of magnetic fields in the RS dynamics in the Poynting-flux-dominated regime is not fully understood. Exploiting the shock jump conditions, we characterize the properties of a magnetized RS. We compare the RS dynamics and forming conditions from different theories and numerical simulations, and reconcile the discrepancies among them. The strict RS forming condition is found to be $\sigma < \sigma_\mathrm{cr}=(8/3)\gamma_4^2(n_1/n_4)$, where $n_4$ and $n_1$ are the rest-frame number densities of the ejecta and the ambient medium, respectively, $\gamma_4$ is the bulk Lorentz factor, and $\sigma_\mathrm{cr}$ is the critical magnetization. Contrary to previous claims, we prove that this condition agrees with other theoretical and simulated results, which can be further applied to the setup and consistency check of future numerical simulations. Using this condition, we propose a characteristic radius for RS formation, and categorize the magnetized shell into three regimes: 'thick shell' (relativistic RS), 'thin shell' (trans-relativistic RS), and 'no RS' regimes. The critical magnetization $\sigma_\mathrm{cr}$ is generally below unity for thin shells, but can potentially reaches $\sim 100-1000$ in the 'thick shell' regime. Our results could be applied to the dynamical evolution of Poynting-flux-dominated ejecta, with potential applications to self-consistent lightcurve modelling of magnetized relativistic outflows. |

|**Abstract**| While large numbers of supermassive black holes have been detected at z>6, their origin is still essentially unclear. Numerical simulations have shown that the conditions for the classical direct collapse scenario are very restrictive and fragmentation is very difficult to be avoided. We thus consider here a more general case of a dense massive protostar cluster at low metallicity (<~ 10^{-3} Z_solar) embedded in gas. We estimate the mass of the central massive object, formed via collisions and gas accretion, considering the extreme cases of a logarithmically flat and a Salpeter-type initial mass function. Objects with masses of at least 10^4 solar could be formed for inefficient radiative feedback, whereas ~10^3 solar mass objects could be formed when the accretion time is limited via feedback. These masses will vary depending on the environment and could be considerably larger, particularly due to the continuous infall of gas into the cloud. As a result, one may form intermediate mass black holes of ~ 10^4 solar masses or more. Upcoming observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and other observatories may help to detect such massive black holes and their environment, thereby shedding additional light on such a formation channel. |
