|**Abstract**|            Context. The formation of stars has been subject to extensive studies in the past decades from molecular cloud to protoplanetary disk scales. It is still not fully understood how the surrounding material in a protostellar system, that often shows asymmetric structures with complex kinematic properties, feeds the central protostar(s) and their disk(s). Aims. We study the spatial morphology and kinematic properties of the molecular gas surrounding the IRS3A and IRS3B protostellar systems in the L1448N region located in the Perseus molecular cloud. Methods. We present 1 mm NOEMA observations of the PRODIGE large program and analyze the kinematic properties of molecular lines. Given the complexity of the spectral profiles, the lines are fitted with up to three Gaussian velocity components. The clustering algorithm DBSCAN is used to disentangle the velocity components into the underlying physical structure. Results. We discover an extended gas bridge (~3000 au) surrounding both the IRS3A and IRS3B systems in six molecular line tracers (C18O, SO, DCN, H2CO, HC3N, and CH3OH). This gas bridge is oriented along the northeast-southwest direction and shows clear velocity gradients on the order of 100 km/s/pc towards the IRS3A system. We find that the observed velocity profile is consistent with analytical streamline models of gravitational infall towards IRS3A. The high-velocity C18O (2-1) emission towards IRS3A indicates a protostellar mass of ~1.2 Msun. Conclusions. While high angular resolution continuum data often show IRS3A and IRS3B in isolation, molecular gas observations reveal that these systems are still embedded within a large-scale mass reservoir with a complex spatial morphology as well as velocity profiles. The kinematic properties of the extended gas bridge are consistent with gravitational infall toward the IRS3A protostar.         |

|| <mark>S. Li</mark>, et al. |

|**Abstract**|            We present observations and analysis of an X1.8 non-eruptive solar flare on 2012 October 23, which is characterized by an extremely large late-phase peak seen in the warm coronal extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) emissions ($\sim$ 3 MK), with the peak intensity over 1.4 times that of main flare peak. The flare is driven by a failed eruption of a magnetic flux rope (MFR), whose strong squeeze force acting on the overlying magnetic structures gives rise to an intense early heating of the late-phase loops. Based on differential emission measure (DEM) analysis, it is found that the late-phase loops experience a "longer-than-expected" cooling without the presence of any obvious additional heating, and meanwhile, their volume emission measure (EM) maintains a plateau level for a long time before turning into an evident decay. Without the need for an additional heating, we propose that the special thermodynamic evolution of the late-phase loops revealed in this flare might arise from loop cross-sectional expansions with height, which are evidenced by both direct measurements from EUV images and by magnetic field extrapolation. By blocking the losses of both heat flux and mass from the corona, such an upward cross-sectional expansion not only elongates the loop cooling time, but also more effectively sustains the loop density, therefore leading to a later-than-expected occurrence of the warm coronal late phase in combination with a sufficiently high late-phase peak. We further verify such a scenario by analytically solving the cooling process of a late-phase loop characterized by a variable cross section.         |
