|**Abstract**|            Ethylene glycol ($\mathrm{(CH_2OH)_2}$, hereafter EG) and Glycolonitrile ($\mathrm{HOCH_2CN}$, hereafter GN) are considered molecular precursors of nucleic acids. EG is a sugar alcohol and the reduced form of Glycolaldehyde ($\mathrm{CH_2(OH)CHO}$, hereafter GA). GN is considered a key precursor of adenine formation (nucleotide) and can be a precursor of glycine (amino acid). Detections of such prebiotic molecules in the interstellar medium are increasingly common. How much of this complexity endures to the planet formation stage, and thus is already present when planets form, remains largely unknown. Here we report Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations in which we tentatively detect EG and GN in the protoplanetary disk around the outbursting protostar V883 Ori. The observed EG emission is best reproduced by a column density of $\mathrm{3.63^{+0.11}_{-0.12} \times 10^{16} \; cm^{-2}}$ and a temperature of at least 300 K. The observed GN emission is best reproduced by a column density of $\mathrm{3.37^{+0.09}_{-0.09} \times 10^{16} \; cm^{-2}}$ and a temperature of $88^{+1.2}_{-1.2}$ K. Comparing the abundance of EG and GN relative to methanol in V883 Ori with other objects, V883 Ori falls between hot cores and comets in terms of increasing complexity. This suggests that the build up of prebiotic molecules continues past the hot core phase into the epoch of planet formation. Nascent planets in such environments may inherit essential building blocks for life, enhancing their potential habitability. Further observations of this protoplanetary disk at higher spectral resolution are required to resolve blended lines and to confirm these tentative detection.         |

|**Abstract**|            Open clusters serve as important tools for accurately studying the chemical evolution of the Milky Way. By combining precise chemical data from high-resolution spectra with information on their distances and ages, we can effectively uncover the processes that have shaped our Galaxy. This study aims to derive NLTE atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances for approximately one hundred giant stars across 33 open clusters with near-solar metallicity. The clusters span a wide range of ages, enabling an assessment of the presence and extent of any age-related abundance gradients. In the Stellar Population Astrophysics (SPA) project, we acquired new high-resolution spectra of open clusters using the HARPS-N echelle spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. We chemically characterized nine open clusters for the first time and reanalyzed previously studied SPA clusters, resulting in a consistent and homogeneous sample. We determined NLTE atmospheric parameters using the equivalent width method and derived NLTE chemical abundances through spectral synthesis for various elements, including alpha elements (Mg, Si, and Ti), light odd-Z elements (Na, Al), iron-peak elements (Mn, Co, and Ni), and neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, and Eu). Our findings are compared with the existing literature, revealing good agreement. We examine the trends of [X/Fe] versus age, confirming previous observations and the enrichment patterns predicted by nucleosynthesis processes. Positive correlations with age are present for Mg, Si, Ti, Al, Mn, Co, Ni, and Sr, while Na and Y and Eu show a negative trend. This study emphasizes the significance of NLTE corrections and reinforces the utility of open clusters as tracers of Galactic chemical evolution. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark sample of NLTE abundances for upcoming open cluster surveys within large-scale projects such as 4MOST and WEAVE.         |

|**Abstract**|            Surveys for exoplanets indicate that the occurrence rate of gas giant planets orbiting late-type stars in orbits with periods shorter than 1000 days is lower than in the case of Sun-like stars. This is in agreement with planet formation models based on the core or pebble accretion paradigm. The CARMENES exoplanet survey has been conducting radial-velocity observations of several targets that show long-period trends or modulations that are consistent with the presence of giant planets at large orbital separations. We present an analysis of five such systems that were monitored with the CARMENES spectrograph, as well as with the IRD spectrograph. In addition, we used archival data to improve the orbital parameters of the planetary systems. We improve the parameters of three previously known planets orbiting the M dwarfs GJ 317, GJ 463, and GJ 3512. We also determine the orbital parameters and minimum mass of the planet GJ 3512 c, for which only lower limits had been given previously. Furthermore, we present the discovery of two new giant planets orbiting the stars GJ 9733 and GJ 508.2, although for the second one only lower limits to the orbital properties can be determined. The new planet discoveries add to the short list of known giant planets orbiting M-dwarf stars with subsolar metallicity at long orbital periods above 2000 days. These results reveal that giant planets appear to form more frequently in wide orbits than in close-in orbits around low-mass and lower metallicity stars.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Euclid mission of the European Space Agency will deliver galaxy and cosmic shear surveys, which will be used to constrain initial conditions and statistics of primordial fluctuations. We present highlights for the Euclid scientific capability to test initial conditions beyond LCDM with the main probes, i.e. 3D galaxy clustering from the spectroscopic survey, the tomographic approach to 3x2pt statistics from photometric galaxy survey, and their combination. We provide Fisher forecasts from the combination of Euclid spectroscopic and photometric surveys for spatial curvature, running of the spectral index of the power spectrum of curvature perturbations, isocurvature perturbations, and primordial features. For the parameters of these models we also provide the combination of Euclid forecasts (pessimistic and optimistic) with current and future measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies., i.e. Planck, the Simons Observatory (SO), and CMB-S4. We provide Fisher forecasts for how the power spectrum and bispectrum from the Euclid spectroscopic survey will constrain the local, equilateral, and orthogonal shapes of primordial non-Gaussianity. We also review how Bayesian field-level inference of primordial non-Gaussianity can constrain local primordial non-Gaussianity. We show how Euclid, with its unique combination of the main probes, will provide the tightest constraints on low redshift to date. By targeting a markedly different range in redshift and scale, Euclid's expected uncertainties are complementary to those obtained by CMB primary anisotropy, returning the tightest combined constraints on the physics of the early Universe.         |

|| Yuankun, et al. -- incl., <mark>Wang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-22*|
|*Comments*| *14 pages, 8 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            We present a crossmatch between a combined catalog of X-ray sources and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Data Preview 1 (DP1) to identify optical counterparts. The six fields targeted as part of DP1 include the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (E-CDF-S), the Euclid Deep Field South (EDF-S), the Fornax Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy (Fornax dSph), 47 Tucanae (47 Tuc) and science validation fields with low galactic and ecliptic latitude (SV\_95\_-25 and SV\_38\_7, respectively). We find matches to 2314 of 3830 X-ray sources. We also compare our crossmatch to DP1 in the E-CDF-S field to previous efforts to identify optical counterparts. The probability of a chance coincidence match varies across each DP1 field, with overall high reliability in the E-CDF-S field, and lower proportion of high-reliability matches in the other fields. The majority of previously known sources that we detect are, unsurprisingly, active galaxies. We plot the X-ray-to-optical flux ratio against optical magnitude and color in an effort to identify Galactic accreting compact objects using a {\em Gaia} color threshold transformed to LSST $g$--$i$, but do not find any strong candidates in these primarily extragalactic counterparts. The DP1 dataset contains high-cadence photometry collected over a number of nights. We calculate the Stetson \( J \) variability index for each object under the hypothesis that X-ray counterparts tend to exhibit higher optical variability; however, the evidence is inconclusive whether our sample is more variable over DP1 timescales when compared to field objects.         |

|| J.-S. Zhang, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark>, <mark>Y. Wang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-22*|
|*Comments*| *33 pages, 6 figures, the 1st of papers from the FAST FRB Key Science Project Collaboration on FRB 20240114A: Energy Budget Analysis*|
|**Abstract**|            Magnetars are widely considered to be the central engine of fast radio bursts (FRBs), capable of driving coherent radio emission through magnetic energy release. The accumulation of burst energy can be employed as a probe to reveal the nature of FRB energy engine. Current observations of repeaters have not yet provided sufficient constraints on the magnetic energy budget for magnetar models. Here we report 11,553 bursts detected from the hyper-active repeating source FRB 20240114A over 214 days during a recent active episode, with a peak burst rate as high as 729 hr$^{-1}$, above the detection threshold of the monitoring observations using Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). This represents the largest recorded burst sample from a single FRB source, comprising more than four times as many bursts as any previously known repeater and exceeding the cumulative total of all published bursts to date. Assuming a typical value of radio efficiency of $10^{-4}$ and a beaming factor of 0.1, the estimated total isotropic burst energy of this source exceeds 86\% of the dipolar magnetic energy of a typical magnetar with a polar surface magnetic field of $10^{15}$ G and a radius of $10^6$ cm. The total energy release of this source is about one and a half orders of magnitude higher than that of other known repeaters. We further provide the most stringent lower limit of $\bf{4.7\times10^{32}}$ G cm$^3$ on the magnetic moment of the underlying magnetar. The findings suggest that either the central engine emits with exceptionally high radio efficiency, possesses a small beaming factor, or it should be a more powerful compact object than typically considered in current magnetar models.         |

|*Comments*| *23 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables, the 2nd of papers from the FAST FRB Key Science Project Collaboration on FRB 20240114A: (quasi-) period search*|
|**Abstract**|            Possible periodic features in fast radio bursts (FRBs) may provide insights into their astrophysical origins. Using extensive observations from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we conduct a search for periodicity across multiple timescales in the exceptionally active repeater source FRB 20240114A. A detailed analysis of 11,553 bursts reveals three candidate periodic signals (3.4-6$\sigma$), with frequencies of approximately 1.486 Hz, 1.576 Hz, and 1.865 Hz. This finding offers tentative evidence for a potential association with magnetar spin, although further studies are necessary for definitive confirmation. On longer timescales, a 67.5-69.2 day activity cycle is identified using two independent methods, with a significance exceeding $3.5\sigma$. In the burst time series, quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the range of a few hundred Hz are identified, with a significance exceeding 5$\sigma$, and a strong correlation is found between their central frequencies and widths (Pearson $R=0.97$). The decomposed temporal profiles of these QPOs suggest an amplitude-modulated quasi-periodic signal. The burst clusters manifest periodic burst trains ranging from a few milliseconds to several tens of milliseconds, revealing transient periodic characteristics. Despite the unprecedentedly large sample size from a single repeating FRB source during a time-continuous active period, no stable periodic signals are detected. Instead, there are multiple QPOs that dynamically evolve over time. These results clarify the bias of previous studies that occasionally detected QPOs believed to be potentially related to the spin of compact objects.         |

|*Comments*| *22 pages, 13 figures, 1 tables, the 3rd of papers from the FAST FRB Key Science Project Collaboration on FRB 20240114A: Burst Morphology Analysis*|
|**Abstract**|            This study investigates the morphological classification and drifting rate measurement of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB20240114A using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). Detected on January 14, 2024, FRB20240114A showed an exceptionally high burst rate. During a continuous 15,780-second monitoring session on March 12, 2024, 3,203 bursts (2,109 burst-clusters) were detected. We refine the definitions of sub-bursts, bursts, and burst-clusters. Using an average dispersion measure (DM) of 529.2 pc cm$^{-3}$, burst-clusters were classified into Downward Drifting, Upward Drifting, No Drifting, No Evidence for Drifting, Not-Clear, and Complex categories. Notably, 233 (23.82%) of the 978 drifting burst-clusters showed upward drifting. Excluding 142 upward drifting single-component clusters, the remaining 91 upward drifting double- or multiple-components clusters account for 10.89% of the drifting sample. Further restricting to those with consecutive time intervals, only 9 upward drifting bursts remain. An inverse correlation is found between drifting rate and sub-burst effective width. Upward drifting single-component clusters tend to have smaller effective widths, bandwidths, and fluxes than downward drifting ones. For these upward drifting clusters, drifting rate increases with peak frequency. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test reveals longer consecutive intervals in upward drifting clusters compared to downward ones, suggesting differing underlying mechanisms.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-22*|
|*Comments*| *15 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables; accepted for publication in ApJ Letters*|
|**Abstract**|            We report the detection and characterization of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) in the X-ray spectra of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2020afhd, based on observations from NICER, Swift, and XMM. Prominent blueshifted absorption features were detected exclusively during the intermediate phase of the event, occurring between days 172 and 212 within the first 300 days post-discovery. During this period, the UFO appeared no earlier than day 74, strengthened between days 172 and 194, and disappeared after day 215. This marks the first time that the full evolutionary sequence of X-ray outflows has been observed in a TDE. Moreover, the outflows exhibited a dramatic deceleration from ~0.19c to ~0.0097c over a span of approximately 10 days. Photoionization spectral analysis reveals an inverse correlation between outflow velocity and ionization parameter, in contradiction to the predictions from radiation pressure-driven wind. Eventually, we propose that the delayed onset of the outflows may result from an increase in the wind opening angle and/or metal enrichment, particularly iron and oxygen, during the disk formation phase.         |

|*Comments*| *85 pages, 14 figures, under review of Nature Astronomy*|
|**Abstract**|            The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs), the brightest cosmic radio explosions, is still unknown. Bearing critical clues to FRBs' origin, the long-term evolution of FRBs has yet to be confirmed, since the field is still young and most FRBs were seen only once. Here we report clear evidence of decadal evolution of FRB~20121102A, the first precisely localized repeater. In conjunction with archival data, our FAST and GBT monitoring campaign since 2020 reveals a significant 7% decline of local dispersion measure (DM). The rotation measure (RM) of 30,755$\pm$16 $\mathrm{rad\,m^{-2}}$ detected in the last epoch represents a 70% decrease compared to that from December 2016. The $\sigma_{RM}$ parameter, which describes the complexity of the magneto-ionic environment surrounding the source, was shown to have decreased by 13%. These general trends reveal an evolving FRB environment, which could originate from an early-phase supernova associated with an enhanced pair wind from the FRB central engine.         |
