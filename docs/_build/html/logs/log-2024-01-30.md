|**Abstract**| The exquisite angular resolution and sensitivity of JWST is opening a new window for our understanding of the Universe. In nearby galaxies, JWST observations are revolutionizing our understanding of the first phases of star formation and the dusty interstellar medium. Nineteen local galaxies spanning a range of properties and morphologies across the star-forming main sequence have been observed as part of the PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1 Treasury program at spatial scales of $\sim$5-50pc. Here, we describe pjpipe, an image processing pipeline developed for the PHANGS-JWST program that wraps around and extends the official JWST pipeline. We release this pipeline to the community as it contains a number of tools generally useful for JWST NIRCam and MIRI observations. Particularly for extended sources, pjpipe products provide significant improvements over mosaics from the MAST archive in terms of removing instrumental noise in NIRCam data, background flux matching, and calibration of relative and absolute astrometry. We show that slightly smoothing F2100W MIRI data to 0.9" (degrading the resolution by about 30 percent) reduces the noise by a factor of $\approx$3. We also present the first public release (DR1.0.1) of the pjpipe processed eight-band 2-21 $\mu$m imaging for all nineteen galaxies in the PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1 Treasury program. An additional 55 galaxies will soon follow from a new PHANGS-JWST Cycle 2 Treasury program. |

|**Abstract**| The modeling of convection is a long standing problem in stellar physics. Up-to-now, all ad hoc models rely on a free parameter alpha (among others) which has no real physical justification and is therefore poorly constrained. However, a link exists between this free parameter and the entropy of the stellar adiabat. Prescriptions, derived from 3D stellar atmospheric models, are available that provide entropy as a function of stellar atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, chemical composition). This can provide constraints on alpha through the development of entropy-calibrated models. Several questions arise as these models are increasingly used. Which prescription should be used? How do uncertainties impact entropy-calibrated models? We aim to study the three existing prescriptions and determine which one should be used, and how. We implemented the entropy-calibration method into the stellar evolution code Cesam2k20 and performed comparisons with the Sun and the alpha Cen system. In addition, we used data from the CIFIST grid of 3D atmosphere models to evaluate the accuracy of the prescriptions. Of the three entropy prescriptions available, we determine which one best reproduces the entropies of the 3D models. We also demonstrate that the entropy obtained from this prescription should be corrected for the evolving chemical composition and for an entropy offset different between various EoS tables, following a precise procedure, otherwise classical parameters obtained from the models will be strongly biased. Finally, we also provide table with entropy of the adiabat of the CIFIST grid, as well as fits of these entropies. We performed a precise examination of entropy-calibrated modelling, and gave recommendations on which adiabatic entropy prescription to use, how to correct it and to implement the method into a stellar evolution code. |

|**Abstract**| The exoplanet diversity has been linked to the disc environment in which they form, where the host star metallicity and the formation pathways play a crucial role. In the context of the core accretion paradigm, the initial stages of planet formation require the growth of dust material from micrometre size to planetesimal size bodies before core accretion can kick in. Although numerous studies have been conducted on planetesimal formation, it is still poorly understood how this process takes place in low metallicity stellar environments. We explore planetesimals formation in stellar environments primarily with low metallicity. We performed global 1D viscous disc evolution simulations including grain growth, evaporation and condensation of chemical species at ice lines. We followed the formation of planetesimals during disc evolution and tested different metallicities, disc sizes and turbulent viscosity strengths. We find that at solar and sub-solar metallicities, there is a significant enhancement in the midplane dust-to-gas mass ratios at the ice lines but this leads to planetesimal formation only at the water ice line. In our simulations, [Fe/H] = -0.6 is the lowest limit of metallicity for planetesimal formation where a few Earth masses of planetesimals could form. For such extreme disc environments, large discs are more conducive than small discs for forming large amounts of planetesimals at a fixed metallicity, because the pebble flux can be maintained for a longer time resulting in a longer and more efficient planetesimal formation phase. At lower metallicities, planetesimal formation is less supported in quiescent discs compared to turbulent discs, because the pebble flux can be maintained for a longer time. The amount of planetesimals formed at sub-solar metallicities in our simulations places a limit on core sizes that could possibly only result in the formation of super-Earths. |

|**Abstract**| $\omega$ Centauri is considered the most massive globular cluster of the Milky Way and likely the former nuclear star cluster of a galaxy accreted by the Milky Way. It is speculated to contain an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) from several dynamical models. However, uncertainties regarding the location of the cluster center or the retention of stellar remnants limit the robustness of the IMBH detections reported so far. In this paper, we derive and study the stellar kinematics from the highest-resolution spectroscopic data yet, using the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) in the narrow field mode (NFM) and wide field mode (WFM). Our exceptional data near the center reveal for the first time that stars within the inner 20" ($\sim$0.5 pc) counter-rotate relative to the bulk rotation of the cluster. Using this dataset, we measure the rotation and line-of-sight velocity dispersion (LOSVD) profile out to 120$''$ with different centers proposed in the literature. We find that the velocity dispersion profiles using different centers match well with those previously published. Based on the counter--rotation, we determine a kinematic center and look for any signs of an IMBH using the high-velocity stars close to the center. We do not find any significant outliers $>$60 km/s within the central 20$''$, consistent with no IMBH being present at the center of $\omega$ Centauri. A detailed analysis of Jeans' modeling of the putative IMBH will be presented in the next paper of the series. |

|*Appeared on*| *2024-01-30*|

|**Abstract**| The empirical relations between rotation period, chromospheric activity, and age can be used to estimate stellar age. To calibrate these relations, we present a catalog, including the masses and ages of 52,321 FGK dwarfs, 47,489 chromospheric activity index $logR^{+}_{HK}$, 6,077 rotation period $P_{rot}$ and variability amplitude $S_{ph}$, based on data from LAMOST DR7, Kepler and Gaia DR3. We find a pronounced correlation among $P_{rot}$, age, and [Fe/H] throughout the main-sequence phase for F dwarfs. However, the decrease of $logR^{+}_{HK}$ over time is not significant except for those with [Fe/H] $<$ $-$0.1. For G dwarfs, both $P_{rot}$ and $logR^{+}_{HK}$ are reliable age probes in the ranges $\sim$ 2-11 Gyr and $\sim$ 2-13 Gyr, respectively. K dwarfs exhibit a prominent decrease in $logR^{+}_{HK}$ within the age range of $\sim$ 3-13 Gyr when the relation of $P_{rot}-\tau$ is invalid. These relations are very important for promptly estimating the age of a vast number of stars, thus serving as a powerful tool in advancing the fields of exoplanet properties, stellar evolution, and Galactic-archaeology. |
