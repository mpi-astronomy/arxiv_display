|**Abstract**|            Stellar multiple systems play a pivotal role in cluster dynamics and stellar evolution, leading to intense astronomical phenomena like X-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts, Type Ia supernova, and stellar mergers, which are prime sources of gravitational waves. However, their origin remains poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of a septuple protostellar system embedded in a Keplerian disk within the high-mass star-forming region NGC\,6334IN, with close separations of 181-461 AU. The stability analysis reveals that the disk surrounding the septuple system is dynamically unstable, indicating that the septuple system formed via disk fragmentation. Previous studies have typically found only 2--3 members forming via disk fragmentation in both low- and high-mass star-forming regions. Our findings provide compelling observational evidence that the fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable disk is a viable mechanism for the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity, confirming what was previously only a theoretical concept. The results shed new light on the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity in cluster environments.         |

|**Abstract**|            Understanding the nature of dark matter (DM) particles remains a pivotal challenge in modern cosmology. Current cosmological research on these phenomena primarily utilizes cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and other late-time probes, which predominantly focus on large scales. We introduce a novel probe, the 21 cm forest signal, which can be used to investigate DM properties on small scales during the epoch of reionization, thereby addressing the gap left by other cosmological probes. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation from PBHs, can heat the intergalactic medium (IGM). This heating suppresses the amplitude of the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. Therefore, the 1D power spectrum provides an effective method for constraining DM properties. However, astrophysical heating processes in the early universe can also affect the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. In this work, we assess the potential of using the SKA to observe the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum for constraining DM properties, under the assumption that astrophysical heating can be constrained reliably by other independent probes. Under low astrophysical heating conditions, the 1D power spectrum could constrain the DM annihilation cross section and decay lifetime to $\langle\sigma v\rangle \sim {10^{-31}}\,{\rm cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$ and $\tau \sim {10^{30}}\,{\rm s}$ for ${10}\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles, and probe PBHs with masses $\sim {10^{15}}\,{\rm\,g}$ at abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \simeq 10^{-13}$. These constraints represent improvements of 5-6 orders of magnitude over current limits. Furthermore, the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum has the potential to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe PBHs with masses above $10^{18}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes.         |

|**Abstract**|            In this study, we investigate the microstructure properties of four pulsars (PSRs J0953+0755 (B0950+08), J0627+0706, J0826+2637 (B0823+26) and J1946+1805 (B1944+17)) using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), with particular emphasis on identifying microstructure within interpulse (IP). Through the application of autocorrelation function (ACF) analysis and fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques, we have systematically examined the periodicity of microstructure in these pulsars. Our findings represent the first successful detection of microstructure within IP. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis comparing the characteristic timescales ($\tau_{\mu}$) and the characteristic periods $P_{\mu}$ of quasi-periodic microstructure between the main pulse (MP) and IP, and our results indicate that the $\tau_{\mu}$ and $P_{\mu}$ of microstructure across components appear consistent within measurement errors for PSR J0627+0706, but microstructure in IP are relatively smaller than those in MP for PSR J0953+0755. Furthermore, the relationship between $P_{\mu}$ of microstructure and the rotation period in neutron star populations was reconfirmed: $P_{\mu}(\text{ms})=(1.337\pm0.114)\times P(\text{s})^{(1.063\pm0.038)}$.         |

|| R. Ruffini, et al. -- incl., <mark>Y. Wang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-09-09*|
|*Comments*| *15 pages, 9 figures, submitted to ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            The traditional model which assumed GRBs as originating from a single Black Hole (BH) have been modified by the Binary Driven Hypernova (BdHN) model in which the trigger of the GRB originate from a binary system composed of a 10 solar mass CO core and a 2 solar mass neutron star binary companion. The binary period being as short as minutes to hours. Recent results evidence that the most energetic GRBs may have as precursors a sequence of two types of SN: a pair-SN followed soon after by a more traditional core collapse. All this appear to open the way to two new types of SNe: the Pair-SNe without a remnant and a magnetized-rotating-core collapse leading to the formation of a pulsar. We generalize our previous assumptions, here the possibility of fission of the rapidly rotating CO core is examined. The role of the magnetic field of the CO core are equally examined with the magneto-hydrodynamic associated process, all the way to generate overcritical fields and e+ e- pairs. All this appear to open the way to a new types of SN, much in line with pair-SN models and a significant change from the initial non rotating models. The BdHN are characterized by seven new physics Episodes here all used to formulate the new approach. The substantial modification of each Episode are outlined by a leading order treatment.         |

|**Abstract**|            JWST/NIRSpec observations of Makemake reveal a chemically complex surface and evidence of gaseous CH$_4$. Our spectral modeling indicates a surface composition consisting of CH$_4$, CH$_3$D, and possibly CH$_3$OH, combined with aggregates of C$_2$H$_2$ and C$_2$H$_6$. The presence of C$_2$H$_4$ is also considered given its expected photochemical origin. Both areal and layered configurations reproduce the observed spectrum, with the latter being preferred. This composition confirms earlier hydrocarbon detections and suggests that CH$_4$ photolysis is either ongoing or occurred recently. The detection of CH$_3$D yields a D/H ratio in CH$_4$ ice of $(3.98 \pm 0.34) \times 10^{-4}$, consistent within $2\sigma$ with previous estimates. We report the first detection of CH$_4$ fluorescence from Makemake, establishing it as only the second trans-Neptunian object$\unicode{x2014}$after Pluto$\unicode{x2014}$with confirmed volatile release. We explore two scenarios consistent with the observed CH$_4$ emission, though neither fully reproduces the data: an expanding coma, yielding production rates of $(0.2\unicode{x2013}1.6) \times 10^{28}$ molecules s$^{-1}$ and a rovibrational temperature of $\sim$35 K, possibly originating from a localized plume, and a gravitationally bound atmosphere, which, if adopted, implies gas kinetic temperatures near 40 K and surface pressures of $\sim$10 pbar$\unicode{x2014}$values consistent with stellar occultation constraints and an atmosphere in equilibrium with surface CH$_4$ ice. Discriminating between these scenarios will require higher spectral resolution and improved signal-to-noise observations. Together, the gas-phase CH$_4$, intermediate D/H ratio between that in water and CH$_4$ in comets, and complex surface composition challenge the traditional view of Makemake as a quiescent, frozen body.         |

|| Z. Huang, H. Shi, Z. Liu, <mark>N. Wang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-09-09*|
|*Comments*| *15 pages, 8 figures; accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal*|
|**Abstract**|            Convolutional neural networks have shown their ability to differentiate between self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) and cold dark matter (CDM) on galaxy cluster scales. However, their large parameter counts and ''black-box'' nature make it difficult to assess whether their decisions adhere to physical principles. To address this issue, we have built a Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CKAN) that reduces parameter count and enhances interpretability, and propose a novel analytical framework to understand the network's decision-making process. With this framework, we leverage our network to qualitatively assess the offset between the dark matter distribution center and the galaxy cluster center, as well as the size of heating regions in different models. These findings are consistent with current theoretical predictions and show the reliability and interpretability of our network. By combining network interpretability with unseen test results, we also estimate that for SIDM in galaxy clusters, the minimum cross-section $(\sigma/m)_{\mathrm{th}}$ required to reliably identify its collisional nature falls between $0.1\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$ and $0.3\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$. Moreover, CKAN maintains robust performance under simulated JWST and Euclid noise, highlighting its promise for application to forthcoming observational surveys.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present our methodology for identifying known clusters as counterparts to objects in the Euclid Catalogue of Galaxy Clusters (ECGC). Euclid is expected to detect a large number of optically-selected galaxy clusters over the approximately 14000 square degrees of its extragalactic sky survey. Extending out well beyond redshift unity, the catalogue will contain many new high-redshift clusters, while at lower redshifts a fraction of the clusters will have been observed in other surveys. Identifying these known clusters as counterparts to the Euclid-detected clusters is an important step in the validation and construction of the ECGC to augment information with external observables. We present a set of catalogues and meta-catalogues of known clusters that we have assembled for this step, and we illustrate their application and our methodology using the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 RedMaPPer cluster catalogue in lieu of the future ECGC. In the process of this work, we have constructed and deliver an updated EC-RedMaPPer catalogue with multi-wavelength counterparts.         |

|**Abstract**|            New populations of red active galactic nuclei (known as ``Little Red Dots'') discovered by JWST exhibit remarkable spectral energy distributions. Leveraging X-ray through far-infrared observations of two of the most luminous known Little Red Dots, we directly their bolometric luminosities. We find evidence that more than half of the bolometric luminosity likely emerges in the rest-frame optical, with $L_{\rm bol}/L_{5100} = 5$, roughly half the value for ``standard'' Active Galactic Nuclei. Meanwhile, the X-ray emitting corona, UV-emitting black-body, and reprocessed mid to far-infrared emission are all considerably sub-dominant, assuming that the far-infrared luminosity is well below current measured limits. We present new bolometric corrections that dramatically lower inferred bolometric luminosities by a factor of ten compared to published values in the literature. These bolometric corrections are in accord with expectations from models in which gas absorption and reprocessing are responsible for the red rest-frame optical colors of Little Red Dots. We discuss how this lowered luminosity scale suggests a lower mass scale for the population by at least an order of magnitude {\bf (e.g., $\sim 10^5-10^7~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ black holes, and $\sim 10^8~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ galaxies)}, alleviating tensions with clustering, overmassive black holes, and the integrated black hole mass density in the Universe.         |
