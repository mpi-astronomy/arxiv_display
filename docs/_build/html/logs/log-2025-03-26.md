|**Abstract**|            Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) is one of the most complex star clusters in the Milky Way, and likely the stripped nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy. Being the subject of debate between it hosting an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) or a collection of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) in its center, $\omega$ Cen has been intensively studied over the past decades. Our work focuses on characterizing the properties of binary systems in $\omega$ Cen via multi-epoch MUSE spectroscopic observations spanning over eight years and covering much of its central regions (i.e. core radius). We did not detect any stellar-mass BHs candidates orbiting luminous stars, although mock samples indicate a high sensitivity of our survey to such systems. This suggests that BHs orbiting stars may be rare in $\omega$ Cen or in wide orbits around low-mass companions (where our survey is 50% complete) or that the periods of such systems are longer than expected from cluster dynamics. Additionally, we constrained the orbital properties of 19 binary systems in the cluster, with periods ranging from fractions of a day up to several hundred days. We observe an excess of binaries with P $\ge$ 10 d and find evidence that the intrinsic period distribution of binaries in $\omega$ Cen differs from those predicted by cluster evolutionary models.         |

|**Abstract**|            Gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers provide insights into dense matter physics and strong-field gravity, but waveform modeling remains computationally challenging. We develop a deep generative model for gravitational waveforms from BNS mergers, covering the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown, incorporating precession and tidal effects. Using the conditional autoencoder, our model efficiently generates waveforms with high fidelity across a broad parameter space, including component masses $(m_1, m_2)$, spin components $(S_{1x}, S_{1y}, S_{1z}, S_{2x}, S_{2y}, S_{2z})$, and tidal deformability $(\Lambda_1, \Lambda_2)$. Trained on $3 \times 10^5$ waveforms from the IMRPhenomXP\_NRTidalv2 waveform model, it achieves an average overlap accuracy of 99.6\% on the test set. The model significantly accelerates waveform generation. For a single sample, it requires $0.12$ seconds (s), compared to $0.38$ s for IMRPhenomXP\_NRTidalv2 and $0.62$ s for IMRPhenomPv2\_NRTidal, making it approximately 3 to 5 times faster. When generating $10^3$ waveforms, the network completes the task in $0.86$ s, while traditional waveform approximation methods take over $46$--$53$ s. Our model achieves a total time of $7.48$ s to generate $10^4$ such waveforms, making it about 60 to 65 times faster than traditional waveform approximation methods. This speed advantage enables rapid parameter estimation and real-time gravitational wave searches. With higher precision, it will support low-latency detection and broader applications in multi-messenger astrophysics.         |

|**Abstract**|            This article presents the construction and validation of complete stellar mass-selected, volume-limited galaxy samples using the Legacy Survey (data release 10) galaxy catalogs, covering $\sim16,800$ deg$^2$ of extra-galactic sky, and extending to redshift $z<0.35$. We measure the correlation function of these galaxies with tiny statistical uncertainties at the percent level and systematic uncertainties up to 5\%. A 4-parameter halo occupation distribution (HOD) model is fitted to retrieve the population of host halos, yielding results on the stellar to halo mass relation consistent with the current models of galaxy formation and evolution. Using these complete galaxy samples, we measure and analyze the cross-correlation (X-corr) between galaxies and all soft X-ray photons observed by SRG/eROSITA in the 0.5-2 keV band over $\sim13,000$ deg$^2$. The cross correlation measurements have unprecedented sub-percent statistical uncertainty and ~5-10\% systematic uncertainty. An extension to the halo model is introduced to interpret the X-corr, decomposing contributions from X-ray point sources, hot gas (CGM), satellites, and the 2-halo term. For low stellar mass thresholds ($\log M^*/M_{\odot}>$ 10, 10.25, 10.5), we find that the point source emission dominates the X-corr at small separation ($r<80$kpc). Then, in the range ($80<r<2$Mpc), the emission from large halos hosting satellite galaxies dominates. Finally, on scales beyond that considered here ($r>2$Mpc), the 2-halo term becomes dominant. Interestingly, there is no scale at which the CGM dominates. In the range ($20<r<200$kpc), the CGM contributes to more than 10\% of the signal. Progressively, with the minimum stellar mass increasing, the CGM emission increases. We constrain the $M_{500c}-L_X$ scaling relation slope, $1.629^{+0.091}_{-0.089}$, at the 5\% level using the samples with the lowest mass threshold.         |
