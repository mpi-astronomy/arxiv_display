|**Abstract**|            It is well known that almost all isolated dwarf galaxies are actively forming stars. We report the discovery of Hedgehog, an isolated quiescent dwarf galaxy at a distance of $2.41\pm0.14$ Mpc with a stellar mass of $M_\star \approx 10^{5.8}\, M_\odot$. The distance is measured using surface brightness fluctuations with both Legacy Surveys and deep Magellan/IMACS imaging data. Hedgehog is 1.7 Mpc from the nearest galaxy group, Centaurus A, and has no neighboring galaxies within 1 Mpc, making it one of the most isolated quiescent dwarfs at this stellar mass. It has a red optical color, early-type morphology, and shows no UV emission. This indicates that Hedgehog has an old stellar population and is quiescent in star formation. Compared with other quiescent dwarfs in the Local Group and Local Volume, Hedgehog appears smaller in size for its luminosity but is consistent with the mass--size relations. Hedgehog might be a backsplash galaxy from the Centaurus A group, but it could also have been quenched in the field by ram pressure stripping in the cosmic web, reionization, or internal processes such as supernova and stellar feedback. Future observations are needed to fully unveil its formation, history, and quenching mechanisms.         |

|**Abstract**|            The properties of the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) in the cosmic filaments are among the least quantified in modern astrophysics. eROSITA All Sky Survey (eRASS) provides us with a unique opportunity to study the X-ray emission of the WHIM. We applied both imaging and spectroscopic stacking techniques to the data of the first four eRASS scans to inspect the X-ray emissions from 7817 cosmic filaments identified from Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical galaxy samples. We obtained a 9-sigma significant detection of the total X-ray signal from filaments in the 0.3-1.2 keV band. We introduce a novel method to estimate the contamination fraction from unmasked X-ray halos, active galactic nuclei, and X-ray binaries that are associated with galaxies in filaments. We found an approximately 40% contamination fraction by these unmasked sources, suggesting that the remaining 60% of the signal could be from the WHIM and a 5.4-sigma detection significance of the WHIM. Moreover, we modeled the temperature and baryon density contrast of the detected WHIM by fitting the stacked spectrum and surface brightness profile. The best-fit temperature log(T/k)=6.84+/-0.07 obtained by using a single temperature model is marginally higher than the simulation results, which could be due to the fitting of a single temperature model on a multi-temperature spectrum. The best-fit baryon density contrast log\Delta_b=1.88+/-0.18 generally agrees with the X-ray emitting phases in the IllustrisTNG simulation, suggesting that the broadband X-ray emission traces the high temperature and density end of the entire WHIM population.         |

|| Y. Huang, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-06-04*|
|*Comments*| *17 pages, 7 figures and 3 tables, submitted for review*|
|**Abstract**|            The existence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) is crucial for understanding various astrophysical phenomena, yet their existence remains elusive, except for the LIGO-Virgo detection. We report the discovery of a high-velocity star J0731+3717, whose backward trajectory about 21 Myr ago intersects that of globular cluster M15 within the cluster tidal radius. Both its metallicity [Fe/H] and its alpha-to-iron abundance ratio [$\alpha$/Fe] are consistent with those of M15. Furthermore, its location falls right on the fiducial sequence of the cluster M15 on the color-absolute magnitude diagram, suggesting similar ages. These support that J0731+3717 is originally associated with M15 at a confidence level of $5.4\sigma$. We find that such a high-velocity star ($V_{\rm ej} = 548^{+6}_{-5}$ km s$^{-1}$) was most likely tidally ejected from as close as one astronomical unit to the center of M15, confirming an IMBH ($\ge 100 M_{\odot}$ with a credibility of 98%) as the exclusive nature of the central unseen mass proposed previously.         |

|**Abstract**|            The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) is a two-meter space telescope with multiple back-end instruments. The Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) is an essential subsystem of the CSST Precision Image Stability System to ensure the required absolute pointing accuracy and line-of-sight stabilization. In this study, we construct the Main Guide Star Catalog for FGS. To accomplish this, we utilize the information about the FGS and object information from the Gaia Data Release 3. We provide an FGS instrument magnitude and exclude variables, binaries, and high proper motion stars from the catalog to ensure uniform FGS guidance capabilities. Subsequently, we generate a HEALPix index, which provides a hierarchical tessellation of the celestial sphere, and employ the Voronoi algorithm to achieve a homogeneous distribution of stars across the catalog. This distribution ensures adequate coverage and sampling of the sky. The performance of the CSST guide star catalog was assessed by simulating the field of view of the FGS according to the CSST mock survey strategy catalog. The analysis of the results indicates that this catalog provides adequate coverage and accuracy. The catalog's performance meets the FGS requirements, ensuring the functioning of the FGS and its guidance capabilities.         |
