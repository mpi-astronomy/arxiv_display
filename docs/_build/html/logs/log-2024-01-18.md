|**Abstract**| We investigate the 2023 season data from high-cadence microlensing surveys with the aim of detecting partially covered short-term signals and revealing their underlying astrophysical origins. Through this analysis, we ascertain that the signals observed in the lensing events KMT-2023-BLG-0416, KMT-2023-BLG-1454, and KMT-2023-BLG-1642 are of planetary origin. Considering the potential degeneracy caused by the partial coverage of signals, we thoroughly investigate the lensing-parameter plane. In the case of KMT-2023-BLG-0416, we have identified two solution sets, one with a planet-to-host mass ratio of $q\sim 10^{-2}$ and the other with $q\sim 6\times 10^{-5}$, within each of which there are two local solutions emerging due to the inner-outer degeneracy. For KMT-2023-BLG-1454, we discern four local solutions featuring mass ratios of $q\sim (1.7-4.3)\times 10^{-3}$. When it comes to KMT-2023-BLG-1642, we identified two locals with $q\sim (6-10)\times 10^{-3}$ resulting from the inner-outer degeneracy. We estimate the physical lens parameters by conducting Bayesian analyses based on the event time scale and Einstein radius. For KMT-2023-BLG-0416L, the host mass is $\sim 0.6~M_\odot$, and the planet mass is $\sim (6.1-6.7)~M_{\rm J}$ according to one set of solutions and $\sim 0.04~M_{\rm J}$ according to the other set of solutions. KMT-2023-BLG-1454Lb has a mass roughly half that of Jupiter, while KMT-2023-BLG-1646Lb has a mass in the range of between 1.1 to 1.3 times that of Jupiter, classifying them both as giant planets orbiting mid M-dwarf host stars with masses ranging from 0.13 to 0.17 solar masses. |
