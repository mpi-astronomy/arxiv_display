|**Abstract**|            Silicate clouds are known to significantly impact the spectra of late L-type brown dwarfs, with observable absorption features at ~ 10 micron. JWST has reopened our window to the mid-infrared with unprecedented sensitivity, bringing the characterization of silicates into focus again. Using JWST, we characterize the planetary-mass brown dwarf PSO J318.5338-22.8603, concentrating on any silicate cloud absorption the object may exhibit. PSO J318's spectrum is extremely red, and its flux is variable, both of which are likely hallmarks of cloud absorption. We present JWST NIRSpec PRISM, G395H, and MIRI MRS observations from 1-18 micron. We introduce a method based on PSO J318's brightness temperature to generate a list of cloud species that are likely present in its atmosphere. We then test for their presence with petitRADTRANS retrievals. Using retrievals and grids from various climate models, we derive bulk parameters from PSO J318's spectra, which are mutually compatible. Our retrieval results point to a solar to slightly super-solar atmospheric C/O, a slightly super-solar metallicity, and a 12C/13C below ISM values. The atmospheric gravity proves difficult to constrain for both retrievals and grid models. Retrievals describing the flux of PSO J318 by mixing two 1-D models (``two-column models'') appear favored over single-column models; this is consistent with PSO J318's variability. The JWST spectra also reveal a pronounced absorption feature at 10 micron. This absorption is best reproduced by introducing a high-altitude cloud layer of small (<0.1 micron), amorphous SiO grains. The retrieved particle size and location of the cloud is consistent with SiO condensing as cloud seeding nuclei. High-altitude clouds comprised of small SiO particles have been suggested in previous studies, therefore the SiO nucleation we potentially observe in PSO J318 could be a more wide-spread phenomenon.         |

|**Abstract**|            The chemical composition of warm gas giant exoplanet atmospheres (with Teq < 1000 K) is not well known due to the lack of observational constraints. HAT-P-12 b is a warm, sub-Saturn-mass transiting exoplanet that is ideal for transmission spectroscopy. One transit of HAT-P-12 b was observed with JWST NIRSpec in the 2.87-5.10 $\mu$m range with a resolving power of $\sim$1000. The JWST data are combined with archival observations from HST WFC3 covering the 1.1-1.7 $\mu$m range. The data are analysed using two data reduction pipelines and two atmospheric retrieval tools. Atmospheric simulations using chemical forward models are performed. CO2, CO, and H2O are detected at 12.2, 4.1, and 6.0 $\sigma$ confidence, respectively. Their volume mixing ratios are consistent with an atmosphere of $\sim$10 times solar metallicity and production of CO2 by photochemistry. CH4 is not detected and seems to be lacking, which could be due to a high intrinsic temperature with strong vertical mixing or other phenomena. SO2 is also not detected and its production seems limited by low upper atmospheric temperatures ($\sim$500 K at $P<10^{-3}$ bar inferred from 1D retrievals), insufficient to produce it in detectable quantities ($\gtrsim$ 800 K required according to photochemical models). Retrievals indicate the presence of clouds between $10^{-1}$ and $10^{-3}$ bar. This study points towards an atmosphere for HAT-P-12 b that could be enriched in carbon and oxygen with respect to its host star. When including the production of CO2 via photochemistry, an atmospheric metallicity that is close to Saturn's can explain the observations. Metallicities inferred for other gas giant exoplanets based on their CO2 mixing ratios may need to account for its photochemical production pathways. This may impact studies on mass-metallicity trends and links between exoplanet atmospheres, interiors, and formation history.         |

|**Abstract**|            Tracing dense molecular gas, the fuel for star formation, is essential for the understanding of the evolution of molecular clouds and star formation processes. We compare the emission of HCN(1-0), HNC(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) with the emission of N2H+(1-0) at cloud-scales (125 pc) across the central 5x7 kpc of the Whirlpool galaxy, M51a, from "Surveying the Whirlpool galaxy at Arcseconds with NOEMA" (SWAN). We find that the integrated intensities of HCN, HNC and HCO+ are more steeply correlated with N2H+ emission compared to the bulk molecular gas tracer CO, and we find variations in this relation across the center, molecular ring, northern and southern disk of M51. Compared to HCN and HNC emission, the HCO+ emission follows the N2H+ emission more similarly across the environments and physical conditions such as surface densities of molecular gas, stellar mass, star-formation rate, dynamical equilibrium pressure and radius. Under the assumption that N2H+ is a fair tracer of dense gas at these scales, this makes HCO+ a more favorable dense gas tracer than HCN within the inner disk of M51. In all environments within our field of view, even when removing the central 2 kpc, HCN/CO, commonly used to trace average cloud density, is only weakly depending on molecular gas mass surface density. While ratios of other dense gas lines to CO show a steeper dependency on the surface density of molecular gas, it is still shallow in comparison to other nearby star-forming disk galaxies. The reasons might be physical conditions in M51 that are different from other normal star-forming galaxies. Increased ionization rates, increased dynamical equilibrium pressure in the central few kpc and the impact of the dwarf companion galaxy NGC 5195 are proposed mechanisms that might enhance HCN and HNC emission over HCO+ and N2H+ emission at larger-scale environments and cloud scales.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present panchromatic 0.4-21 microns observations of the nearby (~7.2 Mpc) Type II supernova 2024ggi, obtained during the plateau phase at ~55 d past explosion. Our dataset includes JWST spectra spanning 1.7-14 microns, MIR imaging at 7.7 and 21 microns, and near-simultaneous ground-based optical and NIR spectra covering 0.32-1.8 microns. The NIR and MIR spectral features of SN 2024ggi are dominated by HI emission. We present line IDs and a toy PHOENIX/1D model that reproduces the observations well, especially the continuum redward of 0.9 microns We compare SN 2024ggi to SN 2022acko and SN 2023ixf, two other Type II supernovae that were also observed by JWST, and highlight key similarities and differences in their spectral features. No evidence for a MIR excess or dust is found at these epochs, with the model matching the observed flux out to 21 microns. We discuss the model's shortcomings, focusing on the density profile, which suppresses line blanketing and produces features in the optical that are too narrow. Our results show the power of panchromatic studies in both exploring the nature of the SN ejecta and constraining detailed models of SNe.         |

|**Abstract**|            Most long Gamma-ray bursts originate from a rare type of massive stellar explosion. Their afterglows, while rapidly fading, can be initially extremely luminous at optical/near-infrared wavelengths, making them detectable at large cosmological distances. Here we report the detection and observations of GRB 250314A by the SVOM satellite and the subsequent follow-up campaign with the near-infrared afterglow discovery and the spectroscopic measurements of its redshift z $\simeq$ 7.3 . This burst happened when the Universe was only $\sim$ 5% of its current age. We discuss the signature of these rare events within the context of the SVOM operating model, and the ways to optimize their identification with adapted ground follow-up observation strategies.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present and analyze panchromatic (0.35-14 $\mu$m) spectroscopy of the Type II supernova 2023ixf, including near- and mid-infrared spectra obtained 33.6 days after explosion during the plateau-phase, with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This is the first in a series of papers examining the evolution of SN 2023ixf with JWST spanning the initial 1000 days after explosion, monitoring the formation and growth of molecules and dust in ejecta and surrounding environment. The JWST infrared spectra are overwhelmingly dominated by H lines, whose profiles reveal ejecta structures unseen in optical spectra. We characterize the nature of these structures, concluding that they likely result from a combination of ejecta geometry, viewing angle, and opacity effects. We find no evidence for the formation of dust precursor molecules such as carbon-monoxide (CO), nor do we observe an infrared excess attributable to dust. These observations imply that any future signatures of molecules or dust in SN 2023ixf will arise either from freshly synthesized material within the ejecta or circumstellar material at radii not yet heated by the supernova at this epoch.         |

|| <mark>J. Liu</mark>, F. Melia |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-28*|
|*Comments*| *19 pages, 24 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            We investigate the impact of a hypothesized delayed initiation of inflation, characterized by a cutoff k_min to the primordial power spectrum in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This cutoff affects both the scalar and tensor spectra, which therefore impacts several measurements of the temperature and polarization distributions. We calculate the angular power spectrum and correlation function with and without k_min in the context of Planck-LCDM, and demonstrate that a non-zero k_min significantly improves the alignment between theory and the observations, including the temperature, E-mode polarization, TE cross-correlation, Q+U polarization and Q-U polarization. It creates an observable signature in both the angular power spectrum and correlation function for all cases. We thus also explore the B-mode polarization, for which current data are not yet precise enough to determine k_min, but whose impact should be detectable with high-precision measurements using future missions, such as LiteBIRD, if the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r, is not much smaller than its current upper limit. We find that the introduction of k_min not only addresses large-angle anomalies in the CMB but also provides a more consistent framework for understanding the early Universe's inflationary phase. These findings highlight the importance of future high-precision CMB observations in validating the existence and implications of k_min.         |

|| I. Bešlić, et al. -- incl., <mark>A. Hughes</mark> |

|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication to Astronomy and Astrophysics*|
|**Abstract**|            The ionization fraction ($f_\mathrm{e}=n_\mathrm{e}/n_\mathrm{H}$) is a crucial parameter of interstellar gas, yet estimating it requires deep knowledge of molecular gas chemistry and observations of specific lines, such as those from isotopologs like HCO$^+$ and N$_2$H$^+$, which are detectable only in dense cores. Previous challenges in constraining $f_\mathrm{e}$ over large areas stemmed from the limitations of observational tracers and chemical models. Recent models have identified molecular line ratios that can trace $f_\mathrm{e}$ in different environments within molecular clouds. In this study, we analyze various molecular lines in the 3-4 mm range to derive the ionization fraction across the Orion B giant molecular cloud. We focus on dense and translucent gas, exploring variations with gas density ($n$) and the far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field ($G_0$). Our findings show that the ionization fraction ranges from $10^{-5.5}$ to $10^{-4}$ in translucent gas and $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-6}$ in dense gas. Notably, $f_\mathrm{e}$ is sensitive to $G_0$ in dense, UV-illuminated regions, decreasing with increasing volume density ($f_\mathrm{e} \propto n^{-0.227}$ for dense and $f_\mathrm{e} \propto n^{-0.3}$ for translucent gas) and increasing with $G_0$. In translucent gas, differing line ratios yield consistent fe values, indicating the importance of electron excitation of HCN and HNC. For dense gas, we recommend using the CN(1-0)/N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) ratio for upper limits on fe and C$^{18}$O(1-0)/HCO$^+$(1-0) for lower limits. In translucent environments, CCH(1-0)/HNC(1-0) effectively traces $f_\mathrm{e}$. The higher fe values in translucent gas align with the C$^+$/CI/CO transition, while values in dense gas are adequate for coupling with the magnetic field.         |

|**Abstract**|            Young exoplanets provide a critical link between understanding planet formation and atmospheric evolution. Direct imaging spectroscopy allows us to infer the properties of young, wide orbit, giant planets with high signal-to-noise. This allows us to compare this young population to exoplanets characterized with transmission spectroscopy, which has indirectly revealed the presence of clouds, photochemistry, and a diversity of atmospheric compositions. Direct detections have also been made for brown dwarfs, but direct studies of young giant planets in the mid-infrared were not possible prior to JWST. With two exoplanets around a solar type star, the YSES-1 system is an ideal laboratory for studying this early phase of exoplanet evolution. We report the first direct observations of silicate clouds in the atmosphere of the exoplanet YSES-1 c through its 9-11 micron absorption feature, and the first circumplanetary disk silicate emission around its sibling planet, YSES-1 b. The clouds of YSES-1 c are composed of either amorphous iron-enriched pyroxene or a combination of amorphous MgSiO3 and Mg2SiO4, with particle sizes of less than or equal to 0.1 micron at 1 millibar of pressure. We attribute the emission from the disk around YSES-1 b to be from submicron olivine dust grains, which may have formed through collisions of planet-forming bodies in the disk.         |
