|**Abstract**|            The MRS mode of the JWST-MIRI instrument gives insights into the chemical richness and complexity of the inner regions of planet-forming disks. Here, we analyse the H$_2$O-rich spectrum of the compact disk DR Tau. We probe the excitation conditions of the H$_2$O transitions observed in different wavelength regions across the entire spectrum using LTE slab models, probing both the rovibrational and rotational transitions. These regions suggest a radial temperature gradient, as the excitation temperature (emitting radius) decreases (increases) with increasing wavelength. To explain the derived emitting radii, we require a larger inclination for the inner disk (i~20-23 degrees) compared to the outer disk (i~5 degrees), agreeing with our previous analysis on CO. We also analyse the pure rotational spectrum (<10 micron) using a large, structured disk (CI Tau) as a template, confirming the presence of the radial gradient, and by fitting multiple components to further characterise the radial and vertical temperature gradients present in the spectrum. At least three temperature components (T~180-800 K) are required to reproduce the rotational spectrum of H$_2$O arising from the inner ~0.3-8 au. These components describe a radial temperature gradient that scales roughly as ~R$^{-0.5}$ in the emitting layers. As the H$_2$O is mainly optically thick, we derive a lower limit on the abundance ratio of H$_2$O/CO~0.17, suggesting a potential depletion of H$_2$O. Similarly to previous work, we detect a cold H$_2$O component (T~180 K) originating from near the snowline. We cannot conclude if an enhancement of the H$_2$O reservoir is observed following radial drift. A consistent analysis of a larger sample of compact disks is necessary to study the importance of drift in enhancing the H$_2$O abundances.         |

|**Abstract**|            Studies of Galactic HII regions are of crucial importance for studying star formation and the evolution of the interstellar medium. Gaining an insight into their physical characteristics contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of these phenomena. The GLOSTAR project aims to provide a GLObal view on STAR formation in the Milky Way by performing an unbiased and sensitive survey. This is achieved by using the extremely wideband (4{-}8 GHz) C-band receiver of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and the Effelsberg 100 m telescope. Using radio recombination lines observed in the GLOSTAR survey with the VLA in D-configuration with a typical line sensitivity of 1{\sigma} {\sim} 3.0 mJy beam{^-1} at {\sim} 5 km s{^-1} and an angular resolution of 25", we cataloged 244 individual Galactic HII regions and derived their physical properties. We examined the mid-infrared (MIR) morphology of these HII regions and find that a significant portion of them exhibit a bubble-like morphology in the GLIMPSE 8 {\mu}m emission. We also searched for associations with the dust continuum and sources of methanol maser emission, other tracers of young stellar objects, and find that 48\% and 14\% of our HII regions, respectively, are coextensive with those. We measured the electron temperature for a large sample of HII regions within Galactocentric distances spanning from 1.6 to 13.1 kpc and derived the Galactic electron temperature gradient as {\sim} 372 {\pm} 28 K kpc{^-1} with an intercept of 4248 {\pm} 161 K, which is consistent with previous studies.         |

|**Abstract**|            Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a new class of transients with luminosities $\sim10 -100$ times larger than the usual core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Their origin is still unclear and one widely discussed scenario involves a millisecond magnetar central engine. The GeV-TeV emission of SLSNe has been predicted in the literature but has not been convincingly detected yet. Here we report the search for the $\gamma$-ray emission in the direction of SN 2017egm, one of the closest SLSNe detected so far, with the 15-year {\it Fermi}-LAT Pass 8 data. There is a transient $\gamma$-ray source appearing about 2 months after this event and lasting a few months. Both the peak time and the luminosity of the GeV emission are consistent with the magnetar model prediction, suggesting that such a GeV transient is the high-energy counterpart of SN 2017egm and the central engine of this SLSNe is a young magnetar.         |
