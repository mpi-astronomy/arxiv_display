|**Abstract**|            The background galaxies in Euclid Early Release Observations images of the Perseus cluster make up a remarkable sample in its combination of 0.57 deg$^2$ area, 25.3 and 23.2 AB mag depth, as well as 0.1" and 0.3" angular resolutions, in optical and near-IR bands, respectively. Towards characterising the history of the Hubble sequence, we perform a preliminary morphological analysis of 2445 and 12,786 galaxies with $I_E < 21$ and $I_E < 23$, respectively. We use single-Sérsic profiles and the sums of a Sérsic bulge and an exponential disc to model these galaxies with SourceXtractor++ and analyse their parameters in order to assess their consistencies and biases. The fitted galaxies to $I_E < 21$ span the various Hubble types with ubiquitous bulge and disc components, and a bulge-to-total light ratio B/T taking all values from 0 to 1. The median effective radius of the single-Sérsic profile is a biased estimate of galaxy size, intermediate between the bulge and disc effective radii, depending on B/T. The axis ratio of the single-Sérsic profile overestimates that of the disc, increasingly so with B/T. The model impacts the photometry with -0.08 to 0.01 mag median systematic $I_E$ offsets between single-Sérsic and bulge+disc total magnitudes, and a 0.05 to 0.15 mag dispersion, from low to high B/T. We measure a median 0.4 mag bulge-disc colour difference in $I_E - J_E$ that originates from the disc-dominated galaxies, whereas bulge-dominated galaxies have similar median colours of their components. Remarkably, we also measure redder-inside disc colour gradients, based on 5 to 10% systematic variations of disc effective radii between the optical and near-IR bands. This analysis demonstrates the usefulness and limits of single-Sérsic profile modelling, and the power of bulge-disc decomposition for reliably characterising the morphology of lenticulars and spirals in Euclid images.         |

|**Abstract**|            In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of an unidentified point-like ultra-high-energy (UHE) $\gamma$-ray source, designated as 1LHAASO J1740+0948u, situated in the vicinity of the middle-aged pulsar PSR J1740+1000. The detection significance reached 17.1$\sigma$ (9.4$\sigma$) above 25$\,$TeV (100$\,$TeV). The source energy spectrum extended up to 300$\,$TeV, which was well fitted by a log-parabola function with $N0 = (1.93\pm0.23) \times 10^{-16} \rm{TeV^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-2}}$, $\alpha = 2.14\pm0.27$, and $\beta = 1.20\pm0.41$ at E0 = 30$\,$TeV. The associated pulsar, PSR J1740+1000, resides at a high galactic latitude and powers a bow-shock pulsar wind nebula (BSPWN) with an extended X-ray tail. The best-fit position of the gamma-ray source appeared to be shifted by $0.2^{\circ}$ with respect to the pulsar position. As the (i) currently identified pulsar halos do not demonstrate such offsets, and (ii) centroid of the gamma-ray emission is approximately located at the extension of the X-ray tail, we speculate that the UHE $\gamma$-ray emission may originate from re-accelerated electron/positron pairs that are advected away in the bow-shock tail.         |

|**Abstract**|            Double-peaked narrow emission lines (DPNELs) might be evidence for the existence of kpc-scale dual AGNs. There are so far large samples of objects with DPNELs in narrow emission line galaxies. Here, a systematic search is made to build a sample of type 1 AGNs with double-peaked [O~{\sc~iii}] from Data Release 16 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Through visually inspecting and fitting [O~{\sc~iii}], fitting broad H$\alpha$ emission lines, performing F-test for [O~{\sc~iii}] profiles, and checking broad H$\beta$ and [O~{\sc~iii}] emission lines, we select 62 type 1 AGNs with reliable double-peaked [O~{\sc~iii}] from 11557 QSOs with z < 0.3. After visually checking the 62 SDSS multi-color images, we find only seven objects with signs of merging. Four possible models for the double-peaked [O~{\sc~iii}] observed in our sample are discussed: the superposition model, AGN outflow model, dual AGN model, and rotating disk model. However, the current results can not provide any one explanation conclusively, and additional observational data are needed to provide the details of narrow line regions. But at least 22 objects with different velocity offsets between double-peaked [O~{\sc~iii}] and narrow H$\alpha$ emission lines could be excluded as dual AGN candidates. The relative velocity offsets of the [O~{\sc~iii}] blue-shifted/red-shifted components are negative to their line flux ratios, which is consistent with dual AGN model. This work provides a new sample of 62 type 1 AGNs with double-peaked [O~{\sc~iii}] for further study.         |

|| <mark>J. Li</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-02-24*|
|*Comments*| *12 pages, 8 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            Customized digital backends for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) are critical components for radio astronomy observatories. There are several serialized products such as the Digital Baseband Converter (DBBC), Reconfigurable Open Architecture Computing Hardware (ROACH) Digital BackEnd (RDBE), and Chinese Data Acquisition System (CDAS). However, the reliance on high-speed analog-to-digital converters (ADC) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) often necessitates dedicated hardware platforms with long development cycles and prohibitive cost, limiting scalability and adaptability to evolving observational needs. To address these challenges, we propose a design leveraging the versatile and cost-effective ROACH2 hardware platform, developed by CASPER (Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research). ROACH2's mature technology and streamlined firmware development capabilities significantly reduce the hardware platform's development cycle and cost, making it ideal for modern astronomical applications. This VLBI digital backend, based on the ROACH2 platform, incorporates key technologies such as Polyphase Filter Banks (PFB) algorithm implementation, digital complex-to-real baseband signal conversion, Mark5B data formatter design and two-bit optimal threshold quantization. These features ensure compatibility with existing systems while providing enhanced performance. The backend's performance was validated through multi-station VLBI experiments, demonstrating its ability to achieve good correlation fringes compared to the customized CDAS2-D system. Furthermore, this platform offers flexibility for rapid deployment of additional digital backends, such as those for spectral line observations, showcasing its potential for broader astronomical applications.         |

|**Abstract**|            Planets are thought to form from dust and gas in protoplanetary disks, and debris disks are the remnants of planet formation. Aged a few Myr up to a few Gyr, debris disks have lost their primordial gas, and their dust is produced by steady-state collisions between larger, rocky bodies. Tens of debris disks, with sizes of tens, sometimes hundreds of au, have been resolved with high spatial resolution, high contrast imagers at optical/near-IR or (sub)-millimeter interferometers. They commonly show cavities, ring-like structures, and gaps, which are often regarded as indirect signatures of the presence of planets that gravitationally interact with unseen planetesimals. However, no planet responsible for these features has been detected yet, probably because of the limited sensitivity (typically 2-10 MJ) of high contrast imaging instruments prior to JWST. We have used the unprecedented sensitivity of JWST/MIRI in the thermal IR to search for such planets in the disk of the ~ 6.4 Myr old star TWA 7. With its pole-on orientation, this three-ring debris disk is indeed ideally suited for such a detection. We unambiguously detected a source 1.5 arsec from the star, that is best interpreted as a cold, sub-Jupiter mass planet. Its estimated mass (~ 0.3 MJ) and position (~ 52 au, de-projected) can thoroughly account for the main disk structures.         |
