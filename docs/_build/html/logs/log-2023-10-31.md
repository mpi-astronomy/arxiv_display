|**Abstract**| The low-$J$ rotational transitions of $^{12}$CO are commonly used to trace the distribution of molecular gas in galaxies. Their ratios are sensitive to excitation and physical conditions in the molecular gas. Spatially resolved studies of CO ratios are still sparse and affected by flux calibration uncertainties, especially since most do not have high angular resolution or do not have short-spacing information and hence miss any diffuse emission. We compare the low-$J$ CO ratios across the disk of two massive, star-forming spiral galaxies NGC2903 and NGC3627 to investigate whether and how local environments drive excitation variations at GMC scales. We use Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the three lowest-$J$ CO transitions at a common angular resolution of 4$''$ (190pc). We measure median line ratios of $R_{21}=0.67^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$, $R_{32}=0.33^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$, and $R_{31}=0.24^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$ across the full disk of NGC3627. We see clear CO line ratio variation across the galaxy consistent with changes in temperature and density of the molecular gas. In particular, toward the center, $R_{21}$, $R_{32}$, and $R_{31}$ increase by 35\%, 50\%, and 66\%, respectively compared to their average disk values. The overall line ratio trends suggest that CO(3-2) is more sensitive to changes in the excitation conditions than the two lower-$J$ transitions. Furthermore, we find a similar radial $R_{32}$ trend in NGC2903, albite a larger disk-wide average of $\langle R_{32}\rangle=0.47^{+0.14}_{-0.08}$. We conclude that the CO low-$J$ line ratios vary across environments in such a way that they can trace changes in the molecular gas conditions, with the main driver being changes in temperature. |

|**Abstract**| Context. Planets are thought to form inside weakly ionized regions of protoplanetary disks, where turbulence creates ideal conditions for solid growth. However, the nature of this turbulence is still uncertain. In this zone, vertical shear instability (VSI) can operate, inducing a low level of gas turbulence and large-scale motions. Resolving kinematic signatures of VSI may reveal the origin of turbulence in planet-forming disks. However, an exploration of kinematic signatures of the interplay between VSI and forming planets is needed for a correct interpretation of radio interferometric observations. Robust detection of VSI would lead to a deeper understanding of the impact of gas turbulence on planet formation. Aims. The goal of this study is to explore the effect of VSI on the disk substructures triggered by an embedded massive planet. We focus on the impact of this interplay on CO kinematic observations with ALMA. Methods. We conduct global 3D hydrodynamical simulations of VSI-unstable disks with and without embedded massive planets, exploring Saturn- and Jupiter-mass cases. We study the effect of planets on the VSI gas dynamics, comparing with viscous disks. Post-processing the simulations with a radiative transfer code, we examine the kinematic signatures expected in CO molecular line emission, varying disk inclination. Further, we simulate ALMA high-resolution observations to test the observability of VSI and planetary signatures. Results. The embedded planet dampens the VSI along a radial region, most effective at the disk midplane. For the Saturn case, the VSI modes are distorted by the planet's spirals producing mixed kinematic signatures. For the Jupiter case, the planet's influence dominates the disk gas kinematics. Conclusions. The presence of massive embedded planets can weaken the VSI large-scale gas flows, limiting its observability in CO kinematic observations. |

|**Abstract**| The chemical inventory of protoplanetary midplanes is the basis for forming planetesimals. Among them, solid-state reactions based on CO/CO$_2$ toward molecular complexity on interstellar dust grains have been studied in theoretical and laboratory work. In this work, the erosion of C dust grains induced by X-ray irradiation of H$_2$O ice was systematically investigated for the first time. The work aims to provide a better understanding of the reaction mechanism using selectively isotope-labeled oxygen/carbon species in kinetic analysis. Ultrahigh vacuum experiments were performed to study the interstellar ice analog on sub-$\mu$m thick C dust at $\sim$13~K. H$_2$O or O$_2$ ice was deposited on the pre-synthesized amorphous C dust and exposed to soft X-ray photons (250--1250~eV). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor in situ the newly formed species as a function of the incident photon fluence. Field emission scanning electron microscopy was used to monitor the morphological changes of (non-)eroded carbon samples. The X-ray processing of the ice/dust interface leads to the formation of CO$_2$, which further dissociates and forms CO. Carbonyl groups are formed by oxygen addition to grain surfaces and are confirmed as intermediate species in the formation process. The yields of CO and CO$_2$ were found to be dependent on the thickness of the carbon layer. The astronomical relevance of the experimental findings is discussed. |

|| <mark>A. Gould</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-10-31*|
|*Comments*| *39 pages, 7 figures, to be submitted to AAS Journals*|
|**Abstract**| I show that industrial-scale mass measurement of isolated black holes (BHs) can be achieved by combining a high-cadence, wide-field microlensing survey such as KMTNet, observations from a parallax satellite in solar orbit, and VLTI GRAVITY+ interferometry. I show that these can yield precision measurements of microlens parallaxes down to $\pi_{\rm E}\sim 0.01$ and Einstein radii down to $\theta_{\rm E}\sim 1\,$mas. These limits correspond to BH masses $M\sim 12\,M_\odot$, deep in the Galactic bulge, with lens-source separations of $D_{LS}\sim 0.6\,$kpc, and they include all BHs in the Galactic disk. I carry out detailed analyses of simulations that explore many aspects of the measurement process, including the decisions on whether to carry out VLTI measurements for each long-event candidate. I show that the combination of ground-based and space-based light curves of BH events will automatically exclude the spurious "large parallax" solutions that arise from the standard (Refsdal 1966) analysis, except for the high-magnification events, for which other methods can be applied. The remaining two-fold degeneracy can always be broken by conducting a second VLTI measurement, and I show how to identify the relatively rare cases that this is required. |

|**Abstract**| In this paper, we present the imaging and spectroscopic observations of the simultaneous horizontal and vertical large-amplitude oscillation of a quiescent filament triggered by an EUV wave on 2022 October 02. Particularly, the filament oscillation involved winking phenomenon in Ha images and horizontal motions in EUV images. Originally, a filament and its overlying loops across AR 13110 and 13113 erupted with a highly inclined direction, resulting in an X1.0 flare and a non-radial CME. The fast lateral expansion of loops excited an EUV wave and the corresponding Moreton wave propagating northward. Once the EUV wavefront arrived at the quiescent filament, the filament began to oscillate coherently along the horizontal direction and the winking filament appeared concurrently in Ha images. The horizontal oscillation involved an initial amplitude of 10.2 Mm and a velocity amplitude of 46.5 km/s, lasting for 3 cycles with a period of 18.2 minutes and a damping time of 31.1 minutes. The maximum Doppler velocities of the oscillating filament are 18 km/s (redshift) and 24 km/s (blueshift), which was derived from the spectroscopic data provided by CHASE/HIS. The three-dimensional velocity of the oscillation is determined to be 50 km/s at an angle of 50 to the local photosphere plane. Based on the wave-filament interaction, the minimum energy of the EUV wave is estimated to be 2.7 10 20 J. Furthermore, this event provides evidence that Moreton wavesshould be excited by the highly inclined eruptions. |

|*Appeared on*| *2023-10-31*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**| One of the main goals of most future CMB experiments is the precise measurement of CMB B-mode polarization, whose major obstacle is the Galactic foregrounds. In this paper, we evaluate the foreground cleaning performance of the variants of the ILC method on partial sky B-modes and analyze the main sources of biases on the BB power spectrum. Specially, we compare the NILC, the cILC (in three domains) and the cMILC methods for AliCPT-1 simulations. We find that the cILC methods implemented in harmonic space and needlet space are both competent to clean different models of foregrounds, which bias the tensor-to-scalar ratio about 0.008 at maximum, and constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio to r<0.043 (95\%CL) for the AliCPT-1 configuration. We also note that the deviation of the estimated noise bias from the actual one for ILC, dubbed the noise bias error (NBE) in this paper, might make significant effects on the power spectrum for a small footprint and low signal-to-noise ratio CMB experiment. We finally obtain its relation with respect to the noise residual which fits well with the simulated results. |
