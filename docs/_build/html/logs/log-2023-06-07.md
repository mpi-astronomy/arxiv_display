|**Abstract**| We present 10 novel [OIII]$\lambda 4363$ auroral line detections up to $z\sim 9.5$ measured from ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). We leverage the deepest spectroscopic observations yet taken with NIRSpec to determine electron temperatures and oxygen abundances using the direct T$_e$ method. We directly compare against a suite of locally calibrated strong-line diagnostics and recent high-$z$ calibrations. We find the calibrations fail to simultaneously match our JADES sample, thus warranting a self-consistent revision of these calibrations for the high-$z$ Universe. We find weak dependence between R2 and O3O2 with metallicity, thus suggesting these line-ratios are ineffective in the high-$z$ Universe as metallicity diagnostics and degeneracy breakers. We find R3 and R23 still correlate with metallicity, but we find tentative flattening of these diagnostics, thus suggesting future difficulties when applying these strong-line ratios as metallicity indicators in the high-$z$ Universe. We also propose and test an alternative diagnostic based on a different combination of R3 and R2 with a higher dynamic range. We find a reasonably good agreement (median offset of 0.002 dex, median absolute offset of 0.13 dex) with the JWST sample at low metallicity. Our sample demonstrates higher ionization/excitation ratios than local galaxies with rest-frame EWs(H$\beta$) $\approx 200 -300$ Angstroms. However, we find the median rest-frame EWs(H$\beta$) of our sample to be $\sim 2\text{x}$ less than the galaxies used for the local calibrations. This EW discrepancy combined with the high ionization of our galaxies does not present a clear description of [OIII]$\lambda 4363$ production in the high-$z$ Universe, thus warranting a much deeper examination into the factors affecting production. |

|**Abstract**| A large fraction of the accreting supermassive black hole population is shrouded by copious amounts of gas and dust, particularly in the distant ($z\gtrsim1$) Universe. While much of the obscuration is attributed to a parsec-scale torus, there is a known contribution from the larger-scale host galaxy. Using JWST/NIRCam imaging from the COSMOS-Web survey, we probe the galaxy-wide dust distribution in X-ray selected AGN up to $z\sim2$. Here, we focus on a sample of three AGNs with their host galaxies exhibiting prominent dust lanes, potentially due to their edge-on alignment. These represent 27% (3 out of 11 with early NIRCam data) of the heavily obscured ($N_H>10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) AGN population. With limited signs of a central AGN in the optical and near-infrared, the NIRCam images are used to produce reddening maps $E(B-V)$ of the host galaxies. We compare the mean central value of $E(B-V)$ to the X-ray obscuring column density along the line-of-sight to the AGN ($N_H\sim10^{23-23.5}$ cm$^{-2}$). We find that the extinction due to the host galaxy is present ($0.6\lesssim E(B-V) \lesssim 0.9$; $1.9 \lesssim A_V \lesssim 2.8$) and significantly contributes to the X-ray obscuration at a level of $N_H\sim10^{22.5}$ cm$^{-2}$ assuming an SMC gas-to-dust ratio which amounts to $\lesssim$30% of the total obscuring column density. These early results, including three additional cases from CEERS, demonstrate the ability to resolve such dust structures with JWST and separate the different circumnuclear and galaxy-scale obscuring structures. |
