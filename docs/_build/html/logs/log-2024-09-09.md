|**Abstract**|            Context. Dust coagulation and fragmentation impact the structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks and set the initial conditions for planet formation. Dust grains dominate the opacities, they determine the cooling times of the gas, they influence the ionization state of the gas, and the grain surface area is an important parameter for the chemistry in protoplanetary disks. Therefore, dust evolution should not be ignored in numerical studies of protoplanetary disks. Available dust coagulation models are, however, too computationally expensive to be implemented in large-scale hydrodynamic simulations. This limits detailed numerical studies of protoplanetary disks, including these effects, mostly to one-dimensional models. Aims. We aim to develop a simple - yet accurate - dust coagulation model that can be implemented in hydrodynamic simulations of protoplanetary disks. Our model shall not significantly increase the computational cost of simulations and provide information about the local grain size distribution. Methods. The local dust size distributions are assumed to be truncated power laws. Such distributions can be characterized by two dust fluids (large and small grains) and a maximum particle size, truncating the power law. We compare our model to state-of-the-art dust coagulation simulations and calibrate it to achieve a good fit with these sophisticated numerical methods. Results. Running various parameter studies, we achieved a good fit between our simplified three-parameter model and DustPy, a state-of-the-art dust coagulation software. Conclusions. We present TriPoD, a sub-grid dust coagulation model for the PLUTO code. With TriPoD, we can perform two-dimensional, vertically integrated dust coagulation simulations on top of a hydrodynamic simulation. Studying the dust distributions in two-dimensional vortices and planet-disk systems is thus made possible.         |

|**Abstract**|            In the single-field model, the preheating process occurs through self-resonance of inflaton field. We study the nonlinear structures generated during preheating in the $\alpha$-attractor models and monodromy models. The potentials have a power law form $\propto\left|\phi\right|^{2n}$ near the origin and a flat region away from bottom, which are consistent with current cosmological observations. The Floquet analysis shows that potential parameters in monodromy model have a significant influence on the region of resonance bands. The analytical oscillons solution for the $\alpha$-attractor T model with parameter $n=1$ is derived using the small amplitude analysis method. Besides we investigate the formation of nonlinear structures, the equation of state and the energy transfer through the (3+1) dimensional lattice simulation. We find that the symmetric T potential and the asymmetric E potential in the $\alpha$-attractor models have similar nonlinear dynamics. And the potential parameter $n$ in monodromy model significantly influences the lifetime of transients, whereas the parameter $q$ exerts minimal impact on the nonlinear dynamics.         |

|**Abstract**|            Neutrino flavor instabilities appear to be omnipresent in dense astrophysical environments, thus presenting a challenge to large-scale simulations of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers (NSMs). Subgrid models offer a path forward, but require an accurate determination of the local outcome of such conversion phenomena. Focusing on "fast" instabilities, related to the existence of a crossing between neutrino and antineutrino angular distributions, we consider a range of analytical mixing schemes, including a new, fully three-dimensional one, and also introduce a new machine learning (ML) model. We compare the accuracy of these models with the results of several thousands of local dynamical calculations of neutrino evolution from the conditions extracted from classical NSM simulations. Our ML model shows good overall performance, but struggles to generalize to conditions from a NSM simulation not used for training. The multidimensional analytic model performs and generalizes even better, while other analytic models (which assume axisymmetric neutrino distributions) do not have reliably high performances, as they notably fail as expected to account for effects resulting from strong anisotropies. The ML and analytic subgrid models extensively tested here are both promising, with different computational requirements and sources of systematic errors.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report the spectroscopic discovery of a massive quiescent galaxy at $z_{\rm spec}=7.29\pm0.01$, just $\sim700\,$Myr after the Big Bang. RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 was selected from public JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging from the PRIMER survey and observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of RUBIES. The NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum reveals one of the strongest Balmer breaks observed thus far at $z>6$, no emission lines, but tentative Balmer and Ca absorption features, as well as a Lyman break. Simultaneous modeling of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum and NIRCam and MIRI photometry (spanning $0.9-18\,\mu$m) shows that the galaxy formed a stellar mass of log$(M_*/M_\odot)=10.23^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ in a rapid $\sim 100-200\,$Myr burst of star formation at $z\sim8-9$, and ceased forming stars by $z\sim8$ resulting in $\log \rm{sSFR/yr}^{-1}<-10$. We measure a small physical size of $209_{-24}^{+33}\,{\rm pc}$, which implies a high stellar mass surface density within the effective radius of $\log(\Sigma_{*,\rm e}/{\rm M_\odot\,kpc}^{-2})=10.85_{-0.12}^{+0.11}$ comparable to the densities measured in quiescent galaxies at $z\sim2-5$. The 3D stellar mass density profile of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 is remarkably similar to the central densities of local massive ellipticals, suggesting that at least some of their cores may have already been in place at $z>7$. The discovery of RUBIES-UDS-QG-z7 has strong implications for galaxy formation models: the estimated number density of quiescent galaxies at $z\sim7$ is $>100\times$ larger than predicted from any model to date, indicating that quiescent galaxies have formed earlier than previously expected.         |
