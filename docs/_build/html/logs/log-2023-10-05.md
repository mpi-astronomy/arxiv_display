|**Abstract**| Nearby associations are ideal regions to study coeval samples of protoplanetary and debris disks down to late M-type stars. Those aged 5-10,Myrs, where most of the disk should have already dissipated forming planets, are of particular interest. We present the first complete study of both protoplanetary and debris disks in a young region, using the $\eta$ Chamaeleontis association as a test bench to study the cold disk content. We obtained sub-millimeter data for the entire core population down to late M-type stars, plus a few halo members. We performed a continuum sub-millimeter survey with APEX/LABOCA of all the core populations of $\eta$ Cha association. Disk properties have been derived by modeling protoplanetary and debris disks using RADMC 2D and DMS, respectively. We find that protoplanetary disks in $\eta$ Cha typically have holes with radii of the order of 0.01 to 0.03 AU, while ring-like emission from the debris disks is located between 20 au and 650 au from the central star. The parallaxes and Gaia eDR3 photometry, in combination with the PARSEC and COLIBRI isochrones, enable us to confirm an age of $\eta$ Cha between 7 and 9 Myrs. In general, the disk mass seems insufficient to support accretion over a long time, even for the lowest mass accretors, a clear difference compared with other regions and also a sign that the mass budget is further underestimated. We do not find a correlation between the stellar masses, accretion rates, and disk masses, although this could be due to sample issues. We confirm that the presence of inner holes is not enough to stop accretion unless accompanied by dramatic changes to the total disk mass content. Comparing $\eta$ Cha with other regions at different ages, we find that the physical processes responsible for debris disks (e.g., dust growth, dust trapping) efficiently act in less than 5 Myrs. |

|**Abstract**| One of the current challenges of planet formation theory is to explain the enrichment of observed exoplanetary atmospheres. Past studies have focused on scenarios where either pebbles or planetesimals were the heavy element enrichment's drivers, we combine here both approaches to understand whether the composition of a planet can constrain its formation pathway. We study three different formation scenarios: pebble accretion, pebble accretion with planetesimal formation, combined pebble and planetesimal accretion. We use the chemcomp code to perform semi-analytical 1D simulations of protoplanetary discs, including viscous evolution, pebble drift, and simple chemistry to simulate the growth of planets from planetary embryos to gas giants as they migrate through the disc, while tracking their composition. Our simulations confirm that the composition of the planetary atmosphere is dominated by the accretion of gas enriched by inward drifting and evaporating pebbles. Including planetesimal formation hinders the enrichment, because the pebbles locked into planetesimals cannot evaporate and enrich the disc. This results in a big drop of the accreted heavy elements both in the planetesimal formation and accretion case, proving that planetesimal formation needs to be inefficient in order to explain planets with high heavy element content. Accretion of planetesimals enhances the refractory component of the atmosphere, leading to low volatile to refractory ratios, contrary to the pure pebble scenario. Such low volatile to refractory ratios can also be achieved by planets migrating in the inner disc in pure pebble scenario. Distinguishing these two scenarios requires knowledge about the planet's atmospheric C/H and O/H ratios, which are higher for pure pebble accretion. Therefore, a detailed knowledge of the composition of planetary atmospheres could help to constrain the planet's formation pathway. |
