|**Abstract**|            We present one of the largest uniform optical spectroscopic surveys of X-ray selected sources to date that were observed as a pilot study for the Black Hole Mapper (BHM) survey. The BHM program of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-V is designed to provide optical spectra for hundreds of thousands of X-ray selected sources from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey. This significantly improves our ability to classify and characterise the physical properties of large statistical populations of X-ray emitting objects. Our sample consists of 13079 sources in the eROSITA eFEDS performance verification field, 12011 of which provide reliable redshifts from 0<z<5.8. The vast majority of these objects were detected as point-like sources (X-ray flux limit F(0.5-2 keV)>6.5x10^-15 erg/s/cm^2) and were observed for about 20 years with fibre-fed SDSS spectrographs. After including all available redshift information for the eFEDS sources from the dedicated SDSS-V plate programme and archival data, we visually inspected the SDSS optical spectra to verify the reliability of these redshift measurements and the performance of the SDSS pipeline. The visual inspection allowed us to recover reliable redshifts (for 99% of the spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of >2) and to assign classes to the sources, and we confirm that the vast majority of our sample consists of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Only ~3% of the eFEDS/SDSS sources are Galactic objects. We also show the diversity of the optical spectra of the X-ray selected AGNs and provide spectral stacks with a high signal-to-noise ratio in various sub-samples with different redshift and optical broad-band colours. Our AGN sample contains optical spectra of (broad-line) quasars, narrow-line galaxies, and optically passive galaxies. It is considerably diverse in its colours and in its levels of nuclear obscuration.         |

|**Abstract**|            The advent of JWST has opened new horizons in the study of quasar host galaxies during the reionization epoch ($z > 6$). Building upon our previous initial uncovering of stellar light from two quasar host galaxies at these redshifts, we now report the detection of the stellar light from the full Cycle 1 sample of 12 distant moderate-luminosity quasar ($M_{1450}>-24$ mag) host galaxies at $z>6$ from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). Using JWST/NIRCam observations at 1.5 and 3.6 $\mu$m combined with 2D image decomposition analysis, we successfully detect the host galaxies in 11 out of 12 targets, underscoring the high detection rates achievable with moderate-luminosity quasars. Based on two-band photometry and SED fitting, we find that our host galaxies are massive with log~M$_*$/M$_{\odot} = 9.5\text{-}11.0$. The effective radii range from 0.6 to 3.2 kpc which is comparable to the sizes of inactive galaxies with similar masses as measured with imaging from COSMOS-Web. Intriguingly, the two quasar hosts with post-starburst features, which reside at the high-mass end of our sample and exhibit relatively compact morphologies, are consistent (at the 1-$\sigma$ level) with quiescent galaxies at $z\sim4\text{-}5$ in terms of their sizes and stellar mass surface densities. These findings support the so-called galaxy compaction scenario already being valid at the reionization epoch ($z>6$), in which gas inflows during starburst phases drive centrally concentrated star formation followed by rapid quenching, bridging the structural transition of massive galaxies from relatively extended star-forming disks to compact quiescent systems.         |

|**Abstract**|            Context. Elusive intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $100~M_{\odot} \leq M_{\rm BH}\leq 2\times10^{5}~M_{\odot}$) can act as ``time-squeezing'' machines, enabling studies of AGN geometry through reverberation mapping (RM) on much shorter timescales than their supermassive siblings. Aims. The broad line region (BLR) radius constraints for IMBH candidates with different Eddington ratios probe the unexplored faint end of radius--luminosity ($R-L$) relations and allow us to build a robust $M_{\rm BH}$ estimator. This study aims to (a) confirm a rapidly accreting IMBH candidate; (b) demonstrate the feasibility of the first photometric BLR reverberation mapping (RM) campaign for this class of objects. Methods. The IMBH candidate J1448+16 was identified in the broad H$\alpha$-selected spectroscopic sample from SDSS. We carried out narrow-band H$\alpha$ and broad-band SDSS~g\'~monitoring to check small-scale variability and extract the time lag between the BLR and accretion disk (AD) continuum during 5 months (March--July 2024) using a 60-cm telescope at the Caucasus Mountain Observatory. Results. We confirmed the candidate as an active IMBH using XMM-Newton as a bright X-ray point source with the photon index $\Gamma = 2.32^{+0.15}_{-0.13}$, suggesting the high accretion rate. From a combination of SDSS optical spectra and XMM-Newton observations, we estimate the black hole mass in the range $\sim 0.9-2.4~\times10^{5} M_{\odot}$ and the Eddington rate from $\sim 37-112\%$. We report high-amplitude $\sim 60\%$ intra-night ($\sim 2$~h) H$\alpha$ variability in this highly accreting IMBH. In addition, we extracted a tentative measurement of a BLR RM radius $\sim 1-8~\mathrm{days}$. Conclusions. This work is a proof of concept for further IMBH variability studies and BLR RM campaigns, which will be essential for the calibration of the $R-L$ relation at the faint end.         |

|**Abstract**|            Accurately mapping the mass profiles of low mass dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies allows us to test predictions made by dark matter (DM) models. To date, such analyses have primarily been performed on Milky Way (MW) satellites. Meanwhile, the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is home to 35 known dwarf galaxies, yet only two have been successfully mass-modeled so far. In order to better understand the nature of dark matter, a more comprehensive study of Local Group dwarfs is necessary. In this study, we have undertaken a dynamical study of two higher-luminosity Andromeda dwarf galaxies: Andromeda VI (And VI) and Andromeda XXIII (And XXIII). We infer an enclosed mass for And VI of M(r < r$_{\rm{h}}$) = (4.9 $\pm$ 1.5) $\times$ 10$^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$, corresponding to a mass-to-light ratio of $[M/L]_{r_{\rm{h}}}$ = (27.1 $\pm$ 8.2) M$_{\odot}$/L$_{\odot}$. We infer an enclosed mass for And XXIII of M(r < r$_{\rm{h}}$) = (3.1 $\pm$ 1.9) $\times$ 10$^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$, corresponding to a mass-to-light ratio of $[M/L]_{\rm{r_{h}}}$ = (90.2 $\pm$ 53.9) M$_{\odot}$/L$_{\odot}$. Using the dynamical Jeans modeling tool, GravSphere, we determine And VI and And XXIII's dark matter density at 150 pc, finding $\rho_{\rm{DM,VI}}$(150 pc) = (1.4 $\pm$ 0.5) $\times$ 10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ kpc$^{-3}$ and $\rho_{\rm{DM,XXIII}}$(150 pc) = 0.5$\substack{+0.4 \\ -0.3} \times$ 10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ kpc$^{-3}$. Our results make And VI the first mass-modeled M31 satellite to fall into the cuspy regime, while And XXIII has a lower density, implying either a more cored central dark matter density, or a lowering of the density through tides. This adds And XXIII to a growing list of M31 dwarfs with a central density lower than most MW dwarfs and lower than expected for isolated dwarfs in the Standard Cosmology. This could be explained by the M31 dwarfs having experienced stronger tides than their Milky Way counterparts.         |

|**Abstract**|            Fisher-matrix forecasts are presented for the cosmological surveys of the Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) and the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). The wide, low-redshift coverage of J-PAS and the high-density, high-redshift mapping of PFS are strongly complementary: combining the two reduces marginalized uncertainties on all primary parameters compared with either survey individually. Adding the joint J-PAS+PFS data to next-generation CMB measurements from CMB-S4 and \textsc{LiteBird} yields an expected precision of $\sigma(\sum m_\nu)=0.017\,$eV in the $\Lambda$CDM$+\sum m_\nu+N_{\rm eff}$ framework, sufficient to disfavour the inverted neutrino hierarchy at $2.35\,\sigma$ if the true mass sum equals the normal-ordering minimum. Motivated by recent DESI results, we also forecast within a $w_0w_a$CDM$+\sum m_\nu+N_{\rm eff}$ cosmology, adopting the DESI\,DR2 best-fit values ($w_0=-0.758$, $w_a=-0.82$) as fiducial. The combination CMB+J-PAS+PFS then delivers $\sigma(w_0)=0.044$ and $\sigma(w_a)=0.18$, corresponding to a $5.1\,\sigma$ preference for a time-varying dark-energy equation of state. These findings show that J-PAS and PFS, especially when coupled with Stage-IV CMB observations, will provide competitive tests of neutrino physics and the dynamics of cosmic acceleration.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present ultraviolet (UV) through near-infrared (NIR) photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby SN 2024pxl, the third Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in NGC 6384. SN 2024pxl is a Type Iax supernova (SN Iax) with an intermediate luminosity ($M_r = -16.99\pm0.32$ mag) and an average SN Iax light curve decline rate. SN 2024pxl was discovered $\sim$3 days after first light, and the rising light curve follows a single power law that is inconsistent with significant interaction with a companion star or circumstellar material. Our extensive NIR photometric coverage is comparable to that of the well-observed SNe Iax 2005hk and 2012Z, and we demonstrate that the $J-H$ colors of SNe Iax differ from normal SNe Ia and appear to be more homogeneous as a class. Spectroscopically, we report the earliest-ever NIR spectrum of a SN Iax as measured from maximum light ($t\approx-9$ days): a featureless continuum with similarities to a $\sim$9,000 K blackbody, and the line velocities are consistent with a mixed-ejecta structure, with C, Si, and Fe having similar velocities and velocity evolutions. We find a tentative correlation between the $H$-band break Co II velocity $\sim$20 days post-peak and absolute magnitude, with more luminous SNe Iax showing faster Co II velocities. Our observations suggest that SN 2024pxl resulted from the thermonuclear disruption of a CO white dwarf star that undergoes deflagration burning.         |
