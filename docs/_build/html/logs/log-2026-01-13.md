|**Abstract**|            Aims: The G28.37+0.07 star-forming region is a prototypical infrared dark cloud (IRDC) located at the interface of a converging gas flow. This study characterizes the properties of this dynamic gas flow. Methods: Combining data from the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) with single-dish data from the IRAM30m observatory, we mapped large spatial scales (~81pc^2) at high angular resolution (7.0''x2.6'' corresponding ~2.3x10^4au or ~0.1pc) down to core scales. The spectral setup in the 3mm band covers many spectral lines as well as the continuum emission. Results: The data reveal the proposed west-east converging gas flow in all observed dense gas tracers. We estimate a mass-flow rate along that flow around 10^-3M_sun/yr. Comparing these west-east flow rates to infall rates toward sources along the line of sight, the gas flow rates are roughly a factor of 25 greater than than those along the line of sight. This confirms the dominance of longitudinal motions along the converging gas flow in G28.37. For comparison, in the main north-south IRDC formed by the west-east converging gas flow, infall rates along the line of sight are about an order of magnitude greater than those along the west-east flow. In addition to the kinematic analysis, a comparison of CH_3CN-derived gas temperatures with Herschel-derived dust temperatures typically show higher gas temperatures toward high-density sources. We discuss whether mechanical heating from the conversion of the flow's kinetic energy into thermal energy may explain some of the observed temperature differences. Conclusions: The differences between flow rates along the converging flow, perpendicular to it, and toward the sources at the IRDC center indicate that at the interfaces of converging gas flows - where most of the active star formation takes place - originally more directed gas flows can convert into multidirectional infall motions.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report the confirmation of three transiting exoplanets orbiting TOI-1243 (LSPM~J0902+7138), TOI-4529 (G~2--21), and TOI-5388 (Wolf~346) that were initially detected by TESS through ground-based photometry and radial velocity follow-up measurements with CARMENES. The planets present short orbital periods of $4.65$, $5.88$, and $2.59$ days, and they orbit early-M dwarfs (M2.0V, M1.5V, and M3.0V, respectively). We were able to precisely determine the radius of all three planets with a precision of $< 7\, \%$, the mass of TOI-1243 b with a precision of $19\, \%$, and upper mass limits for TOI-4529 b and TOI-5388 b. The radius of TOI-1243 b is $2.33\pm0.12\, {R_{\oplus}}$, its mass is $7.7 \pm 1.5\,{M_{\oplus}}$, and the mean density is $0.61 \pm 0.15 \, {\rho_\oplus}$. The radius of TOI-4529 b is $1.77 ^{+0.09}_{-0.08} \, {R_{\oplus}}$, the $3 {\sigma}$ upper mass limit is $4.9 \, {M_{\oplus}}$, and the $3 {\sigma}$ upper density limit is $0.88\, {\rho_\oplus}$. The third planet, TOI-5388 b, is Earth-sized with a radius of $0.99 ^{+0.07}_{-0.06} \, {R_{\oplus}}$, a $3 {\sigma}$ upper mass limit of $2.2 \, {M_{\oplus}}$, and a $3 {\sigma}$ upper density limit of $2.2\, {\rho_\oplus}$. While TOI-5388 b is most probably rocky, given its Earth-like radius, TOI-1243 b and TOI-4529 b are located in a highly degenerate region in the mass-radius space. TOI-4529 b appears to lean toward a water-world composition. TOI-1243 b has enough mass to host a significant H-He envelope, although a water-world and pure rocky compositions are also consistent with the data. Our analysis indicates that future atmospheric observations using JWST can aid in determining their real composition. The sample of small planets around M dwarfs is widely used to understand planet formation and composition theories, and our study adds three planets to this sample.         |

|**Abstract**|            We model intrinsic alignments (IA) in Euclid's Flagship simulation to investigate its impact on Euclid's weak lensing signal. Our IA implementation in the Flagship simulation takes into account photometric properties of galaxies as well as their dark matter host halos. We compare simulations against theory predictions, determining the parameters of two of the most widely used IA models: the Non Linear Alignment (NLA) and the Tidal Alignment and Tidal Torquing (TATT) models. We measure the amplitude of the simulated IA signal as a function of galaxy magnitude and colour in the redshift range $0.1<z<2.1$. We find that both NLA and TATT can accurately describe the IA signal in the simulation down to scales of $6$-$7 \,h^{-1}\,$Mpc. We measure alignment amplitudes for red galaxies comparable to those of the observations, with samples not used in the calibration procedure. For blue galaxies, our constraints are consistent with zero alignments in our first redshift bin $0.1 < z < 0.3$, but we detect a non-negligible signal at higher redshift, which is, however, consistent with the upper limits set by observational constraints. Additionally, several hydrodynamical simulations predict alignment for spiral galaxies, in agreement with our findings. Finally, the evolution of alignment with redshift is realistic and comparable to that determined in the observations. However, we find that the commonly adopted redshift power-law for IA fails to reproduce the simulation alignments above $z=1.1$. A significantly better agreement is obtained when a luminosity dependence is included, capturing the intrinsic luminosity evolution with redshift in magnitude-limited surveys. We conclude that the Flagship IA simulation is a useful tool for translating current IA constraints into predictions for IA contamination of Euclid-like samples.         |

|**Abstract**|            Intrinsic alignments of galaxies are potentially a major contaminant of cosmological analyses of weak gravitational lensing. We construct a semi-analytic model of galaxy ellipticities and alignments in the \Euclid Flagship simulation to predict this contamination in Euclid's weak lensing observations. Galaxy shapes and orientations are determined by the corresponding properties of the host haloes in the underlying $N$-body simulation, as well as the relative positions of galaxies within their halo. Alignment strengths are moderated via stochastic misalignments, separately for central and satellite galaxies and conditional on the galaxy's redshift, luminosity, and rest-frame colour. The resulting model is calibrated against galaxy ellipticity statistics from the COSMOS Survey, selected alignment measurements based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey samples, and galaxy orientations extracted from the Horizon-AGN hydrodynamic simulation at redshift $z=1$. The best-fit model has a total of 12 alignment parameters and generally reproduces the calibration data sets well within the $1\sigma$ statistical uncertainties of the observations and the \flagship simulation, with notable exceptions for the most luminous sub-samples on small physical scales. The statistical power of the calibration data and the volume of the single \flagship realisation are still too small to provide informative prior ranges for intrinsic alignment amplitudes in relevant galaxy samples. As a first application, we predict that \Euclid end-of-mission tomographic weak gravitational lensing two-point statistics are modified by up to order $10\,\%$ due to intrinsic alignments.         |

|**Abstract**|            The cycling of carbon between its ionized, atomic, and molecular phases shapes the chemical compositions and physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM). However, ground-based studies of the full carbon cycle have been limited by atmospheric absorption. Dome~A, the most promising site for submillimeter astronomy, has long resisted successful submillimeter astronomical observations. Using the 60~cm Antarctic Terahertz Explorer, we present the first successful CO ($4-3$) and [CI] ($^3P_1 - ^3P_0$) mapping observations of two archetypal triggered massive star-formation regions at Dome~A. These data, together with archival [CII], provide the first complete characterization of all three carbon phases in these environments. We find elevated C$^{0}$/CO abundance ratios in high-extinction regions, plausibly driven by deep penetration of intense radiation fields from massive stars into a clumpy ISM. These findings mark a major milestone for submillimeter astronomy at Dome~A and offer valuable insights into the impact of massive star feedback on the surrounding ISM.         |

|**Abstract**|            Magnetars are the most strongly magnetized compact objects known in the Universe and are regarded as one of the primary engines powering a variety of enigmatic, high-energy transients. However, our understanding of magnetars remains highly limited, constrained by observational sample size and radiative variability. XTE~J1810$-$197, which re-entered a radio-active phase in 2018, is one of only six known radio-pulsating magnetars. Leveraging the distinctive capability for simultaneous dual-frequency observations, we utilized the Shanghai Tianma Radio Telescope (TMRT) to monitor this magnetar continuously at both 2.25 and 8.60~GHz, capturing its entire evolution from radio activation to quenching. This enabled precise characterization of the evolution in its integrated profile, spin frequency, flux density, and spectral index ($\alpha$, defined by $S \propto f^{\alpha}$). The first time derivative of its spin frequency $\dot{\nu}$ passed through four distinct phases -- rapid decrease, violent oscillation, steady decline, and stable recovery -- before returning to its pre-outburst value concomitant with the cessation of radio emission. Remarkably, both the amplitudes and the characteristic time-scales of these $\dot{\nu}$ variations match those observed during the previous outburst that began in 2003, providing the first demonstration that post-outburst rotational evolution and radiative behavior in a magnetar are repeatable. A twisted-magnetosphere model can qualitatively account for this repeatability as well as for the progressive narrowing and abrupt disappearance of the radio pulse radiation, thereby receiving strong observational support.         |

|**Abstract**|            Recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data reveal deviations from $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, conventionally attributed to dynamical dark energy (DE). We demonstrate that these deviations are equally, if not better, explained by interactions between dark matter and dark energy (IDE), without requiring a time-varying DE equation of state. Using a unified framework, we analyze two IDE models--coupled quintessence and coupled fluid--against the latest CMB (Planck, ACT, SPT), DESI BAO, and SN (including DES-Dovekie recalibrated) data. Both IDE scenarios show robust evidence for non-vanishing interactions at the 3-5$\sigma$ level, with marginalized constraints significantly deviating from the $\Lambda$CDM limit. This preference persists even under DES-Dovekie SN recalibration, which weakens dynamical DE evidence. Crucially, for the same number of free parameters, IDE models provide fits to low- and high-redshift data that match or exceed the performance of the CPL dynamical DE parametrization. Our results establish IDE as a physically motivated alternative to dynamical DE, highlighting the necessity of future cosmological perturbation measurements (e.g., weak lensing, galaxy clustering) to distinguish between these paradigms.         |

|**Abstract**|            We investigate the sensitivity of calcium production to nuclear reaction rates of a 40 solar-mass Population III star using 1D multi-zone stellar models. A comprehensive nuclear reaction network was constructed, and all $(p,\gamma)$ and $(p,\alpha)$ reaction rates were individually varied by a factor of 10 up and down, identifying 13 preliminary key reactions for calcium production. To propagate the reaction rate uncertainties on calcium production, two sets of Monte Carlo simulations were performed for these key reactions: one adopting STARLIB reaction rates and the other incorporating updated rates from recent experimental data and evaluations. Our results show that Monte Carlo simulations using the updated rates show good agreement with the observed calcium abundance of the extremely iron-poor star SMSS J031300.36-670839.3 within the 68% confidence interval predicted by the models. In contrast, the observed calcium abundance lies marginally outside the 68% C.I. when using the STARLIB rates. Spearman rank-order correlation analysis and SHAP values show that the $(p,\gamma)$ and $(p,\alpha)$ reactions of F18 and F19 exhibit strong coupled effects on calcium production. These reaction-rate uncertainties need to be reduced to constrain the stellar model predictions. Our study provides insights for future nuclear physics experiments aimed at reducing reaction rate uncertainties in the nucleosynthesis of Population III Stars. Additionally, comparisons between 20 solar-mass and 40 solar-mass Population III stellar models confirm that the latter, with updated reaction rates, is more capable of reproducing the observed Ca abundance and [Ca/Mg] ratio.         |

|**Abstract**|            Flares are usually observed during the afterglow phase of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in soft X-ray, optical and radio bands, but rarely in gamma-ray band. Despite the extraordinary brightness, GECAM-C has accurately measured both the bright prompt emission and flare emission of GRB 221009A without instrumental effects, offering a good opportunity to study the relation between them. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of flare emission of GRB 221009A, which is composed of a series of flares. Among them, we identify an exceptionally bright flare with a record-breaking isotropic energy $E_{\rm iso} = 1.82 \times 10^{53}$ erg of GRB flares. It exhibits the highest peak energy ever detected in GRB flares, $E_{\rm peak} \sim 300$ keV, making it a genuine gamma-ray flare. It also shows rapid rise and decay timescales, significantly shorter than those of typical X-ray flares observed in soft X-ray or optical band, but comparable to those observed in prompt emissions. Despite these exceptional properties, the flare shares several common properties with typical GRB flares. We note that this is the first observation of a GRB flare in the keV-MeV band with sufficiently high temporal resolution and high statistics, which bridges the last gap between prompt emission and flare.         |
