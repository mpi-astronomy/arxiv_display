|**Abstract**| The CMB is a powerful probe of early-universe physics but is only observed after passing through large-scale structure, which changes the observed spectra in important model-dependent ways. This is of particular concern given recent claims of significant discrepancies with low redshift data sets when a standard $\Lambda$CDM model is assumed. By using empirical measurements of the CMB lensing reconstruction, combined with weak priors on the smoothness of the lensing spectrum, foregrounds, and shape of any additional integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, we show how the early-universe parameters can be constrained from CMB observations almost independently of the late-time evolution. This provides a way to test new models for early-universe physics, and measure early-universe parameters, independently of late-time cosmology. Using the empirical measurement of lensing keeps the size of the effect of late-time modelling uncertainty under control, leading to only modest increases in error bars of most early-universe parameters compared to assuming a full evolution model. We provide robust constraints on early-$\Lambda$CDM model parameters using the latest Planck PR4 data and show that with future data marginalizing over a single lensing amplitude parameter is sufficient to remove sensitivity to late-time cosmological model only if the spectral shape matches predictions. |

|**Abstract**| The cosmic-ray ionization rate (CRIR, $\zeta_2$) is one of the key parameters controlling the formation and destruction of various molecules in molecular clouds. However, the current most commonly used CRIR tracers, such as H$_3^+$, OH$^+$, and H$_2$O$^+$, are hard to detect and require the presence of background massive stars for absorption measurements. In this work, we propose an alternative method to infer the CRIR in diffuse clouds using the abundance ratios of OH/CO and HCO$^+$/CO. We have analyzed the response of chemical abundances of CO, OH, and HCO$^+$ on various environmental parameters of the interstellar medium in diffuse clouds and found that their abundances are proportional to $\zeta_2$. Our analytic expressions give an excellent calculation of the abundance of OH for $\zeta_2$ $\leq$10$^{-15}$ s$^{-1}$, which are potentially useful for modelling chemistry in hydrodynamical simulations. The abundances of OH and HCO$^+$ were found to monotonically decrease with increasing density, while the CO abundance shows the opposite trend. With high-sensitivity absorption transitions of both CO (1--0) and (2--1) lines from ALMA, we have derived the H$_2$ number densities ($n_{\rm H_2}$) toward 4 line-of-sights (LOSs); assuming a kinetic temperature of $T_{\rm k}=50\,{\rm K}$, we find a range of (0.14$\pm$0.03--1.2$\pm$0.1)$\times$10$^2$ cm$^{-3}$}. By comparing the observed and modelled HCO$^+$/CO ratios, we find that $\zeta_2$ in our diffuse gas sample is in the { range of $1.0_{-1.0}^{+14.8}$ $\times$10$^{-16}- 2.5_{-2.4}^{+1.4}$ $\times$10$^{-15}$ s$^{-1}$. This is $\sim$2 times higher than the average value measured at higher extinction, supporting an attenuation of CRs as suggested by theoretical models. |

|**Abstract**| The Subaru telescope is currently performing a strategic program (SSP) using the high-precision near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer IRD to search for exoplanets around nearby mid/late-M~dwarfs via radial velocity (RV) monitoring. As part of the observing strategy for the exoplanet survey, signatures of massive companions such as RV trends are used to reduce the priority of those stars. However, this RV information remains useful for studying the stellar multiplicity of nearby M~dwarfs. To search for companions around such ``deprioritized" M~dwarfs, we observed 14 IRD-SSP targets using Keck/NIRC2 observations with pyramid wavefront sensing at NIR wavelengths, leading to high sensitivity to substellar-mass companions within a few arcseconds. We detected two new companions (LSPM~J1002+1459~B and LSPM~J2204+1505~B) and two new candidates that are likely companions (LSPM~J0825+6902~B and LSPM~J1645+0444~B) as well as one known companion. Including two known companions resolved by the IRD fiber injection module camera, we detected seven (four new) companions at projected separations between $\sim2-20$~au in total. A comparison of the colors with the spectral library suggests that LSPM~J2204+1505~B and LSPM~J0825+6902~B are located at the boundary between late-M and early-L spectral types. Our deep high-contrast imaging for targets where no bright companions were resolved did not reveal any additional companion candidates. The NIRC2 detection limits could constrain potential substellar-mass companions ($\sim10-75\ M_{\rm Jup}$) at 10~au or further. The failure with Keck/NIRC2 around the IRD-SSP stars having significant RV trends makes these objects promising targets for further RV monitoring or deeper imaging with JWST to search for smaller-mass companions below the NIRC2 detection limits. |

|**Abstract**| Primordial B-mode detection is one of the main goals of the current and future CMB experiments. However, the weak B-mode signal is overshadowed by several Galactic polarized emissions, such as the thermal dust emission and the synchrotron radiation. Subtracting the foreground components from CMB observations is one of the key challenges in the search for primordial B-mode signal. Here, we construct a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model, called CMBFSCNN (Cosmic Microwave Background Foreground Subtraction with CNN), which can cleanly remove various foreground components from the simulated CMB observational maps with the sensitivity of the CMB-S4 experiment. The noisy CMB Q (or U) maps are recovered with a mean absolute difference of $0.018 \pm 0.023\ \mu$K (or $0.021 \pm 0.028\ \mu$K). To remove residual instrumental noise in the foreground-cleaned map, inspired by the Needlet Internal Linear Combination method, we divide the whole data into two ``half-split maps'' which share the same sky signal but with uncorrelated noise, and perform the cross-correlation technique to reduce the instrumental noise effect at the power spectrum level. We find that the CMB EE and BB power spectra can be precisely recovered with significantly reduced noise effects. Finally, we apply this pipeline on the current Planck observations. As expected, various foregrounds have been cleanly removed on the Planck observational maps and the recovered EE and BB power spectra are in good agreement with the Planck official results. |

|**Abstract**| Future space observatories achieve detection of gravitational waves by interferometric measurements of a carrier phase, allowing to determine relative distance changes, in combination with an absolute distance measurement based on the transmission of pseudo-random noise chip sequences. In addition, usage of direct-sequence spread spectrum modulation enables data transmission. Hereafter, we report on the findings of a performance evaluation of planned receiver architectures, performing phase and distance readout sequentially. An analytical model is presented identifying the power spectral density of the chip modulation at frequencies within the measurement bandwidth as the main driver for phase noise. This model, verified by numerical simulations, excludes binary phase-shift keying modulations for missions requiring pico-meter noise levels at the phase readout, while binary offset carrier modulation, where most of the power has been shifted outside the measurement bandwidth, exhibits superior phase measurement performance. Ranging analyses of the delay-locked loop reveal strong distortion of the pulse shape due to the preceding phase tracking introducing ranging bias variations. Numerical simulations show that these variations, however, originating from data transitions, are compensated by the delay tracking loop and are thus not considered critical, irrespective of the modulation type. |

|**Abstract**| In order to investigate the impact of radio jets on the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN), we present subarcsecond resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) observations of the Teacup galaxy. This is a nearby ($D_{\rm L}$=388 Mpc) radio-quiet type-2 quasar (QSO2) with a compact radio jet ($P_{\rm jet}\approx$10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) that subtends a small angle from the molecular gas disc. Enhanced emission line widths perpendicular to the jet orientation have been reported for several nearby AGN for the ionised gas. For the molecular gas in the Teacup, not only do we find this enhancement in the velocity dispersion but also a higher brightness temperature ratio (T32/T21) perpendicular to the radio jet compared to the ratios found in the galaxy disc. Our results and the comparison with simulations suggest that the radio jet is compressing and accelerating the molecular gas, and driving a lateral outflow that shows enhanced velocity dispersion and higher gas excitation. These results provide further evidence that the coupling between the jet and the ISM is relevant to AGN feedback even in the case of radio-quiet galaxies. |

|**Abstract**| We present radio coverage of the 2019 outburst of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658, obtained with MeerKAT. We compare these data to contemporaneous X-ray and optical measurements in order to investigate the coupling between accretion and jet formation in this system, while the optical lightcurve provides greater detail of the outburst. The reflaring activity following the main outburst peak was associated with a radio re-brightening, indicating a strengthening of the jet in this phase of the outburst. We place quasi-simultaneous radio and X-ray measurements on the global radio:X-ray plane for X-ray binaries, and show they reside in the same region of luminosity space as previous outburst measurements, but significantly refine the correlation for this source. We also present upper limits on the radio emission from the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar MAXI J0911-655 and the transitional Z/Atoll-type transient XTE J1701-462. In the latter source we also confirm that nearby large-scale structures reported in previous radio observations of the source are persistent over a period of ~15 years, and so are almost certainly background radio galaxies and not associated with the X-ray transient. |

|**Abstract**| Hotspots of radio galaxies are regions of shock-driven particle acceleration. Multiple hotspots have long been identified as potential indicators of jet movement or precession. Two frequent explanations describe a secondary hotspot as either the location of a prior jet termination point, or a deflected backflow-driven shock: the so-called Dentist's Drill and Splatter Spot models. We created high-resolution simulations of precessing jets with a range of parameters. In addition to the existing mechanisms, our results show three additional mechanisms for multiple hotspot formation: (1) the splitting of a large terminal hotspots into passive and active components; (2) jet stream splitting resulting in two active hotspots; (3) dynamic multiple hotspot complexes that form as a result of jet termination in a turbulent cocoon, linked here to rapid precession. We show that these distinct types of multiple hotspots are difficult to differentiate in synthetic radio maps, particularly hotspot complexes which can easily be mistaken for the jet itself. We discuss the implication for hypothesised binary supermassive black hole systems where jet precession is a key component of the morphology, and show a selection of potential precession candidates found using the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey Data Release 2 (LoTSS DR2). |

|**Abstract**| Accretion processes in protoplanetary disks produce a diversity of small bodies that played a crucial role in multiple reshuffling events throughout the solar system and in both early and late accretion of planets. Application of thermo-chronometers to meteorites provides precise dating of the formation age of mineralogical components. Nucleosynthetic anomalies indicating a dichotomy between NC and C meteorites and precise parent body (PB) chronology can be combined with thermal evolution models to constrain the timescale of accretion and dynamical processes in the early solar system. Achondrite PBs are considered to have accreted early and mostly in the NC region, while late accretion in the C region produced mostly undifferentiated PBs, such as the CR chondrite PB that formed as late as 4 Ma after CAIs. However, presence of more evolved CR-related meteorites suggests also an earlier accretion timing. We present modeling evidence for a temporally distributed accretion of parent bodies of CR-related meteorite groups that originate from a C reservoir and range from aqueously altered chondrites to partially differentiated primitive achondrites. The PB formation times derived range from <1 Ma to ~4 Ma after solar system formation, with ~3.7 Ma, ~1.5-2.75 Ma, <~0.6 Ma, and <~0.7 Ma for CR, Flensburg, NWA 6704, and NWA 011. This implies that accretion processes in the C reservoir started as early as in the NC reservoir and produced differentiated PBs with carbonaceous compositions in addition to undifferentiated C chondritic PBs. The accretion times correlate inversely with the degree of the meteorites' alteration, metamorphism, or differentiation. Accretion times for CI/CM, Ryugu, and Tafassites PBs of ~3.75 Ma, ~1-3 Ma, and 1.1 Ma, respectively, fit well into this correlation in agreement with the thermal and alteration conditions suggested by the meteorites. |

|**Abstract**| We complete the publication of all microlensing planets (and ``possible planets'') identified by the uniform approach of the KMT AnomalyFinder system in the 21 KMT subprime fields during the 2019 observing season, namely KMT-2019-BLG-0298, KMT-2019-BLG-1216, KMT-2019-BLG-2783, OGLE-2019-BLG-0249, and OGLE-2019-BLG-0679 (planets), as well as OGLE-2019-BLG-0344, and KMT-2019-BLG-0304 (possible planets). The five planets have mean log mass-ratio measurements of $(-2.6,-3.6,-2.5,-2.2,-2.3)$, median mass estimates of $(1.81,0.094,1.16,7.12,3.34)\, M_{\rm Jup}$, and median distance estimates of $(6.7,2.7,5.9,6.4,5.6)\, {\rm kpc}$, respectively. The main scientific interest of these planets is that they complete the AnomalyFinder sample for 2019, which has a total of 25 planets that are likely to enter the statistical sample. We find statistical consistency with the previously published 33 planets from the 2018 AnomalyFinder analysis according to an ensemble of five tests. Of the 58 planets from 2018-2019, 23 were newly discovered by AnomalyFinder. Within statistical precision, half of all the planets have caustic crossings while half do not (as predicted by Zhu et al. 2014), an equal number of detected planets result from major-image and minor-image light-curve perturbations, and an equal number come from KMT prime fields versus subprime fields. |
