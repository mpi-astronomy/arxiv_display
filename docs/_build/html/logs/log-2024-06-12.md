|**Abstract**|            We present JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Spectroscopy in the rest-frame optical bands of the system PJ308-21, a quasar at $z=6.2342$ caught as its host galaxy interacts with companion galaxies. We detect spatially extended emission of several emission lines (H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [OIII], [NII], [SII], HeII), which we use to study the properties of the ionized phase of the interstellar medium: the source and hardness of the photoionizing radiation field, metallicity, dust reddening, electron density and temperature, and star formation. We also marginally detect continuum starlight emission associated with the companion sources. We find that at least two independent satellite galaxies are part of the system. While the quasar host appears highly enriched and obscured, with AGN-like photoionization conditions, the western companion shows minimal dust extinction, low metallicity ($Z\sim0.4$ Z$_\odot$), and star-formation driven photoionization. The eastern companion shows higher extinction and metallicity ($Z\sim0.8$ Z$_\odot$) compared to the western companion, and it is at least partially photoionized by the nearby quasar. We do not find any indication of AGN in the companion sources. Our study shows that while the quasar host galaxy is already very massive ($M_{\rm dyn}>10^{11}$ M$_\odot$), it is still rapidly building up by accreting two relatively massive ($M_{\rm star}\sim 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$) companion sources. This dataset showcases the power of JWST in exposing the build-up of massive galaxies in the first Gyr of the Universe.         |

|**Abstract**|            Protoplanetary disks, the birthplace of planets, are expected to be gravitationally unstable in their early phase of evolution. IM Lup, a well-known T-Tauri star, is surrounded by a protoplanetary disk with spiral arms likely caused by gravitational instability. The IM Lup disk has been observed using various methods, but developing a unified explanatory model is challenging. Here we present a physical model of the IM Lup disk that offers a comprehensive explanation for diverse observations spanning from near-infrared to millimeter wavelengths. Our findings underscore the importance of dust fragility in retaining the observed millimeter emission and reveal the preference for moderately porous dust to explain observed millimeter polarization. We also find that the inner disk region is likely heated by gas accretion, providing a natural explanation for bright millimeter emission within 20 au. The actively heated inner region in the model casts a 100-au-scale shadow, aligning seamlessly with the near-infrared scattered light observation. The presence of accretion heating also supports the fragile dust scenario in which accretion efficiently heat the disk midplane. Due to the fragility of dust, it is unlikely that a potential embedded planet at 100 au formed via pebble accretion in a smooth disk, pointing to local dust enhancement boosting pebble accretion or alternative pathways such as outward migration or gravitational fragmentation.         |

|| S. Hagen, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            The structure of the accretion flow onto supermassive black holes (SMBH) is not well understood. Standard disc models match to zeroth order in predicting substantial energy dissipation within optically-thick material producing a characteristic strong blue/UV continuum. However they fail at reproducing more detailed comparisons to the observed spectral shapes along with their observed variability. Based on stellar mass black holes within our galaxy, accretion discs should undergo a transition into an X-ray hot, radiatively inefficient flow, below a (mass scaled) luminosity of $\sim 0.02\,L_{\rm{Edd}}$. While this has been seen in limited samples of nearby low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) and a few rare changing-look AGN, it is not at all clear whether this transition is present in the wider AGN population across cosmic time. A key issue is the difficulty in disentangling a change in spectral state from increased dust obscuration and/or host galaxy contamination, effectively drowning out the AGN emission. Here we use the new eROSITA eFEDS Survey to identify unobscured AGN from their X-ray emission, matched to excellent optical imaging from Subaru's Hyper Suprime-Cam; allowing the subtraction of the host galaxy contamination. The resulting, uncontaminated, AGN spectra reveal a smooth transition from a strongly disc dominated state in bright AGN, to the collapse of the disc into an inefficient X-ray plasma in the low luminosity AGN, with the transition occurring at $\sim 0.02\,L_{\rm{Edd}}$; revealing fundamental aspects of accretion physics in AGN.         |

|**Abstract**|            Three-dimensional dust density maps are crucial for understanding the structure of the interstellar medium of the Milky Way and the processes that shape it. However, constructing these maps requires large datasets and the methods used to analyse them are computationally expensive and difficult to scale up. As a result it is has only recently become possible to map kiloparsec-scale regions of our Galaxy at parsec-scale grid sampling. We present all-sky three-dimensional dust density and extinction maps of the Milky Way out to 2.8~kpc in distance from the Sun using the fast and scalable Gaussian Process algorithm \DustT. The sampling of the three-dimensional map is $l,b,d = 1^{\circ} \times1^{\circ} \times 1.7$~pc. The input extinction and distance catalogue contains 120 million stars with photometry and astrometry from Gaia DR2, 2MASS and AllWISE. This combines the strengths of optical and infrared data to probe deeper into the dusty regions of the Milky Way. We compare our maps with other published 3D dust maps. All maps quantitatively agree at the $0.001$~mag~pc$^{-1}$ scale with many qualitatively similar features, although each map also has its own features. We recover Galactic features previously identified in the literature. Moreover, we also see a large under-density that may correspond to an inter-arm or -spur gap towards the Galactic Centre.         |

|| P. A. Collaboration, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-06-12*|
|*Comments*| *19 pages, 22 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            The Pierre Auger Observatory is the most sensitive instrument to detect photons with energies above $10^{17}$ eV. It measures extensive air showers generated by ultra high energy cosmic rays using a hybrid technique that exploits the combination of a fluorescence detector with a ground array of particle detectors. The signatures of a photon-induced air shower are a larger atmospheric depth of the shower maximum ($X_{max}$) and a steeper lateral distribution function, along with a lower number of muons with respect to the bulk of hadron-induced cascades. In this work, a new analysis technique in the energy interval between 1 and 30 EeV (1 EeV = $10^{18}$ eV) has been developed by combining the fluorescence detector-based measurement of $X_{max}$ with the specific features of the surface detector signal through a parameter related to the air shower muon content, derived from the universality of the air shower development. No evidence of a statistically significant signal due to photon primaries was found using data collected in about 12 years of operation. Thus, upper bounds to the integral photon flux have been set using a detailed calculation of the detector exposure, in combination with a data-driven background estimation. The derived 95% confidence level upper limits are 0.0403, 0.01113, 0.0035, 0.0023, and 0.0021 km$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ above 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 EeV, respectively, leading to the most stringent upper limits on the photon flux in the EeV range. Compared with past results, the upper limits were improved by about 40% for the lowest energy threshold and by a factor 3 above 3 EeV, where no candidates were found and the expected background is negligible. The presented limits can be used to probe the assumptions on chemical composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays and allow for the constraint of the mass and lifetime phase space of super-heavy dark matter particles.         |
