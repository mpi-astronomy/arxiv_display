|**Abstract**|            Bars are expected to impact the distribution of stellar populations both during bar formation, as they rearrange stars into new orbits, and afterwards, due to the redistribution of star-formation-fuelling gas and transfer of angular momentum. We study the impact of stellar bars on the azimuthal variation of stellar population age, metallicity and mass surface density in $\sim1\,000$ nearby barred galaxies from the SDSS-IV/MaNGA survey. Bars have higher stellar mass density ($0.113^{+0.065}_{-0.067}$ dex) and are more metal-rich ($0.028^{+0.033}_{-0.040}$ dex) than the discs at the same radii. Stellar ages show a variety of bar to inter-bar contrasts with no consistent trend. The difference in metallicity increases with total stellar mass of the galaxy and distance below the star-forming main sequence. We discuss a combination of potentially responsible processes including kinematic separation, more extended star formation histories and more efficient recycling in bars and at bar-spiral arm connections. Additionally, we observe an offset (10°-40°) of the peak metallicity to the bar major axis in star-forming bars in low-mass galaxies, and more metal-rich regions outside the ends of the bar in long bars and quenched galaxies. Furthermore, there is a subtle trend of lower metallicities on the leading side of spiral arms compared to the trailing side. Finally, we report a spiral arm surface density feature, which could point towards a dominant bar-spiral connection and pitch angle of $\alpha \sim 25$°. We interpret these features in the context of bar formation and the impact of large-scale gas flows associated with their presence.         |

|**Abstract**|            Exoplanets form from circumstellar protoplanetary discs whose fundamental properties (notably their extent, composition, mass, temperature and lifetime) depend on the host star properties, such as their mass and luminosity. B-stars are among the most massive stars and their protoplanetary discs test extreme conditions for exoplanet formation. This paper investigates the frequency of giant planet companions around young B-stars (median age of 16 Myr) in the Scorpius-Centaurus association, the closest association containing a large population of B-stars. We systematically search for massive exoplanets with the high-contrast direct imaging instrument SPHERE using the data from the BEAST survey, that targets an homogeneous sample of young B-stars from the wide Sco-Cen association. We derive accurate detection limits in case of non-detections. We found evidence in previous papers for two substellar companions around 42 stars. The masses of these companions are straddling the ~13 Jupiter mass deuterium burning limit but their mass ratio with respect to their host star is close to that of Jupiter. We derive a frequency of such massive planetary mass companions around B stars of 11-5+7%, accounting for the survey sensitivity. The discoveries of substellar companions bcen b and mu2sco B happened after only few stars in the survey had been observed, raising the possibility that massive Jovian planets might be common around B-stars. However our statistical analysis show that the occurrence rate of such planets is similar around B-stars and around solar-type stars of similar age, while B-star companions exhibit low mass ratios and larger semi-major axis.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present cosmological parameter forecasts for the Euclid 6x2pt statistics, which include the galaxy clustering and weak lensing main probes together with previously neglected cross-covariance and cross-correlation signals between imaging/photometric and spectroscopic data. The aim is understanding the impact of such terms on the Euclid performance. We produce 6x2pt cosmological forecasts, considering two different techniques: the so-called harmonic and hybrid approaches, respectively. In the first, we treat all the different Euclid probes in the same way, i.e. we consider only angular 2pt-statistics for spectroscopic and photometric clustering, as well as for weak lensing, analysing all their possible cross-covariances and cross-correlations in the spherical harmonic domain. In the second, we do not account for negligible cross-covariances between the 3D and 2D data, but consider the combination of their cross-correlation with the auto-correlation signals. We find that both cross-covariances and cross-correlation signals, have a negligible impact on the cosmological parameter constraints and, therefore, on the Euclid performance. In the case of the hybrid approach, we attribute this result to the effect of the cross-correlation between weak lensing and photometric data, which is dominant with respect to other cross-correlation signals. In the case of the 2D harmonic approach, we attribute this result to two main theoretical limitations of the 2D projected statistics implemented in this work according to the analysis of official Euclid forecasts: the high shot noise and the limited redshift range of the spectroscopic sample, together with the loss of radial information from subleading terms such as redshift-space distortions and lensing magnification. Our analysis suggests that 2D and 3D Euclid data can be safely treated as independent, with a great saving in computational resources.         |
