|**Abstract**| Herein, we present the statistical properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) for approximately 1 million member galaxies of galaxy groups and clusters, with 0.1 $<$ cluster redshift ($z_{\rm cl}$) $<$ 1.4, selected using Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam, the so-called CAMIRA clusters. In this research, we focused on the AGN power fraction ($f_{\rm AGN}$), which is defined as the proportion of the contribution of AGNs to the total infrared (IR) luminosity, $L_{\rm IR}$ (AGN)/$L_{\rm IR}$, and examined how $f_{\rm AGN}$ depends on (i) $z_{\rm cl}$ and (ii) the distance from the cluster center. We compiled multiwavelength data using the ultraviolet--mid-IR range. Moreover, we performed spectral energy distribution fits to determine $f_{\rm AGN}$ using the CIGALE code with the SKIRTOR AGN model. We found that (i) the value of $f_{\rm AGN}$ in the CAMIRA clusters is positively correlated with $z_{\rm cl}$, with the correlation slope being steeper than that for field galaxies, and (ii) $f_{\rm AGN}$ exhibits a high value at the cluster outskirts. These results indicate that the emergence of AGN population depends on the redshift and environment and that galaxy groups and clusters at high redshifts are important in AGN evolution. Additionally, we demonstrated that cluster--cluster mergers may enhance AGN activity at the outskirts of particularly massive galaxy clusters. Our findings are consistent with a related study on the CAMIRA clusters that was based on the AGN number fraction. |

|**Abstract**| Sizes of narrow emission line regions (NLRs) of AGN could be estimated by [O~{\sc iii}] line luminosity $L_{O3}$ through the known $R_{NLRs}-L_{O3}$ empirical relations. Unfortunately, it is not convenient to test the $R_{NLRs}-L_{O3}$ empirical relations through structure properties of spatially resolved NLRs of large samples of AGN. In this manuscript, a method is proposed to test the $R_{NLRs}-L_{O3}^{\sim0.25}$ empirical relations for AGN NLRs through SDSS Type-2 AGN having few orientation effects on NLRs sizes expected by AGN unified model, after considering sizes $R_{fib}$ of SDSS fiber covered regions. Comparing $R_{fib}$ and $R_{NLRs}$ estimated by $L_{O3}$, Type-2 AGN with $R_{fib}>R_{NLRs}$ (Sample-II) and with $R_{fib}<R_{NLRs}$ (Sample-I) should have different physical properties of NLRs. Accepted electron density gradients in AGN NLRs, statistically higher electron densities (traced by lower flux ratio $R_{S2}$ of [S~{\sc ii}]$\lambda6717$\AA~ to [S~{\sc ii}]$\lambda6731$\AA) could be expected for the Type-2 AGN in the Sample-I. Then, through the collected 1062 SDSS Type-2 AGN in the Sample-I and 3658 SDSS Type-2 AGN in the Sample-II, statistically lower $R_{S2}$ for the Type-2 AGN in the Sample-I can be confirmed with confidence level higher than 5$\sigma$, even after considering necessary effects. Therefore, the results in this manuscript can provide strong clues to support that the reported $R_{NLRs}~\propto~L_{O3}^{0.25}$ empirical relation is preferred to estimate NLRs sizes of SDSS AGN through SDSS fiber spectroscopic results, and also to support the commonly expected electron density gradients in AGN NLRs. |

|**Abstract**| Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond-duration radio bursts of cosmic origin. There have been several dozen FRBs found to repeat. Among them, those precisely localized provide the best opportunity to probe their multi-wavelength counterparts, local environment, and host galaxy that would reveal their origins. Here we report our X-ray, ultraviolet (UV) and optical observations with the $Swift$ satellite that were performed simultaneously in the radio band with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) observations of the repeating FRB 20190520B, aiming at detection of possible multi-wavelength bursts in association with radio bursts and multi-wavelength counterpart of the persistent radio source (PRS). While a total of 10 radio bursts were detected by FAST at the same time of $Swift$ observations, we detected neither X-ray, UV or optical bursts in accompany of the radio bursts, nor persistent multi-wavelength counterpart of the PRS. We obtained the energy upper limits ($3\sigma$) on any multi-wavelength bursts as $5.03 \times 10^{47}$ erg in the hard X-ray band (15-150 keV), $7.98 \times 10^{45}$ erg in the soft X-ray band (0.3-10 keV), and $4.51 \times 10^{44}$ erg in the U band, respectively. The energy ratio between soft X-ray (0.3-10 keV) and radio emission of the bursts is constrained as $<6\times10^{7}$, and the ratio between optical (U band) and radio as $<1.19\times10^{6}$. The 3$\sigma$ luminosity upper limits at the position of PRS are 1.04$\times10^{47}$ (15-150 keV), 8.81$\times10^{42}$ (0.3-10 keV), 9.26$\times10^{42}$ (UVW1), and 2.54$\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (U), respectively. We show that the PRS is much more radio loud than representative pulsar wind nebulae, supernova remnants, extended jet of Galactic X-ray binaries and ultraluminous X-ray sources, suggestive of boosted radio emission of the PRS. |
