|**Abstract**| We present rest-frame optical spectra from Keck/MOSFIRE and Keck/NIRES of 16 candidate ultramassive galaxies targeted as part of the Massive Ancient Galaxies at $z>3$ Near-Infrared (MAGAZ3NE) Survey. These candidates were selected to have photometric redshifts $3\lesssim z_{\rm phot}<4$, photometric stellar masses log($M$/M$_\odot$)$>11.7$, and well-sampled photometric spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the UltraVISTA and VIDEO surveys. In contrast to previous spectroscopic observations of blue star-forming and post-starburst ultramassive galaxies, candidates in this sample have very red SEDs implying significant dust attenuation, old stellar ages, and/or active galactic nuclei (AGN). Of these galaxies, eight are revealed to be heavily dust-obscured $2.0<z<2.7$ galaxies with strong emission lines, some showing broad features indicative of AGN, three are Type I AGN hosts at $z>3$, one is a $z\sim1.2$ dusty galaxy, and four galaxies do not have a confirmed spectroscopic redshift. In fact, none of the sample has |$z_{\rm spec}-z_{\rm phot}$|$<0.5$, suggesting difficulties for photometric redshift programs in fitting similarly red SEDs. The prevalence of these red interloper galaxies suggests that the number densities of high-mass galaxies are overestimated at $z\gtrsim3$ in large photometric surveys, helping to resolve the `impossibly early galaxy problem' and leading to much better agreement with cosmological galaxy simulations. A more complete spectroscopic survey of ultramassive galaxies is required to pin down the uncertainties on their number densities in the early universe. |

|**Abstract**| We carried out very deep VLT/SPHERE imaging polarimetry of the nearby system Eps Eri based on 38.5 hours of integration time with a 600 - 900 nm broadband filter to search for polarized scattered light from a planet or from circumstellar dust using AO, coronagraphy, high precision differential polarimetry, and angular differential imaging. We have improved several data reduction and post-processing techniques and also developed new ones to further increase the sensitivity of SPHERE/ZIMPOL. The data provide unprecedented contrast limits, but no significant detection of a point source or an extended signal from circumstellar dust. For each observing epoch, we obtained a point source contrast for the polarized intensity between $2\cdot 10^{-8}$ and $4\cdot 10^{-8}$ at the expected separation of the planet Eps Eri b of 1'' near quadrature phase. The polarimetric contrast limits are about six to 50 times better than the intensity limits because polarimetric imaging is much more efficient in speckle suppression. Combining the entire 14-month data set to the search for a planet moving on a Keplerian orbit with the K-Stacker software further improves the contrast limits by a factor of about two, to about $8 \cdot 10^{-9}$ at 1''. This would allow the detection of a planet with a radius of about 2.5 Jupiter radii. The surface brightness contrast limits achieved for the polarized intensity from an extended scattering region are about 15 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ at 1'', or up to 3 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ deeper than previous limits. For Eps Eri, these limits exclude the presence of a narrow dust ring and they constrain the dust properties. This study shows that the polarimetric contrast limits for reflecting planets with SPHERE/ZIMPOL can be improved to a level $<10^{-8}$ simply by collecting more data over many nights and using the K-Stacker software. |

|**Abstract**| In this work, we explore the capability of future gravitational wave (GW) standard siren observations to constrain the total neutrino mass in some typical interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We examine the combined potential of the third-generation ground-based GW detector network and a short $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) detector similar to the THESEUS telescope for cosmological analysis. Our findings suggest that future GW standard siren observations could modestly refine the upper limit on the total neutrino mass, enhancing it by $5\%$ to $10\%$ over the existing limit given by the CMB+BAO+SN data. Additionally, the future observations are expected to significantly improve the constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $H_0$. Moreover, the measurements could enhance the precision of the coupling strength $\beta$ by $23\%$ to $42\%$. |

|| H. Zhu, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-05-01*|

|**Abstract**| Numerical simulations indicate that correlations exist between the velocity distributions of stars and dark matter (DM). We study the local DM velocity distribution based on these correlations. We select K giants from LAMOST DR8 cross-matched with Gaia DR3, which has robust measurements of three-dimensional velocity and metallicity, and separate them into the disk, halo substructure and main halo components in the chemo-dynamical space utilizing the Gaussian Mixture Model. The substructure component is highly radially anisotropic, and possibly related to the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) merger event, while the halo component is isotropic and accreted from the earliest mergers following the Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution (Standard Halo Model, SHM). We find that the GES-like substructure contributes $\sim85\%$ of the local non-disk stars in the Solar neighbourhood, which is nearly invariant when applying different volume cuts or additional angular momentum constraints. Utilizing the metallicity-stellar-mass relation and the stellar-mass-halo-mass relation, we find that $\sim25_{-15}^{+24}\%$ of local DM is in the kinematic substructure. Combined with the stellar distributions of non-disk components, we compute the velocity distribution of local DM. The modified heliocentric velocity distribution of local DM shifts to a lower speed and has a sharper peak compared to the SHM, which yields updated detection limits for the DM direct detection experiments. Our work confirms that the local DM velocity distribution deviates from the SHM, and needs to be properly accounted in the DM detection experiments. |
