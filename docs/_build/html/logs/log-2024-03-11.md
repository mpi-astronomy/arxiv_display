|**Abstract**| Context. Two protoplanets have recently been discovered within the PDS 70 protoplanetary disk. JWST/NIRCam offers a unique opportunity to characterize them and their birth environment at wavelengths difficult to access from the ground. Aims. We aim to image the circumstellar environment of PDS 70 at 1.87 $\mu$m and 4.83 $\mu$m, assess the presence of Pa-$\alpha$ emission due to accretion onto the protoplanets, and probe any IR excess indicative of heated circumplanetary material. Methods. We obtain non-coronagraphic JWST/NIRCam images of PDS 70 within the MINDS (MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey) program. We leverage the Vortex Image Processing (VIP) package for data reduction, and develop dedicated routines for optimal stellar PSF subtraction, unbiased imaging of the disk, and protoplanet flux measurement in this type of dataset. A radiative transfer model of the disk is used to disentangle the contributions from the disk and the protoplanets. Results. We re-detect both protoplanets and identify extended emission after subtracting a disk model, including a large-scale spiral-like feature. We interpret its signal in the direct vicinity of planet c as tracing the accretion stream feeding its circumplanetary disk, while the outer part of the feature may rather reflect asymmetric illumination of the outer disk. We also report a bright signal consistent with a previously proposed protoplanet candidate enshrouded in dust, near the 1:2:4 mean-motion resonance with planets b and c. The 1.87 $\mu$m flux of planet b is consistent with atmospheric model predictions, but not that of planet c. We discuss potential origins for this discrepancy, including significant Pa-$\alpha$ line emission. The 4.83 $\mu$m fluxes of planets b and c suggest enshrouding dust or heated CO emission from their circumplanetary environment. |

|**Abstract**| The Near-infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope is uniquely suited to studying galaxies in the distant Universe with its combination of multi-object capabilities and sensitivity over a large range in wavelength (0.6-5.3 microns). Here we present the NIRSpec Wide survey, part of the NIRSpec Instrument Science Team's Guaranteed Time Observations, using NIRSpec's microshutter array to obtain spectra of more than 3200 galaxies at $z>1$ at both low- and high-resolution ($R\approx100$ and 2700) for a total of 105 hours. With 31 pointings covering $\approx$320 arcmin$^2$ across the five CANDELS fields with exquisite ancillary photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope, the NIRSpec Wide survey represents a fast and efficient way of using JWST to probe galaxies in the early Universe. Pointing centers are determined to maximize the observability of the rarest, high-value sources. Subsequently, the microshutter configurations are optimized to observe the maximum number of "census" galaxies with a selection function based primarily on HST/F160W magnitude, photometric/slitless grism redshift, and predicted \ha\ flux tracing the bulk of the galaxy population at cosmic noon ($z_{\rm med}=2.0$). We present details on the survey strategy, the target selection, an outline of the motivating science cases, and discuss upcoming public data releases to the community. |

|**Abstract**| We present the largest catalog to-date of star clusters and compact associations in nearby galaxies. We have performed a V-band-selected census of clusters across the 38 spiral galaxies of the PHANGS-HST Treasury Survey, and measured integrated, aperture-corrected NUV-U-B-V-I photometry. This work has resulted in uniform catalogs that contain $\sim$20,000 clusters and compact associations which have passed human inspection and morphological classification, and a larger sample of $\sim$100,000 classified by neural network models. Here, we report on the observed properties of these samples, and demonstrate that tremendous insight can be gained from just the observed properties of clusters, even in the absence of their transformation into physical quantities. In particular, we show the utility of the UBVI color-color diagram, and the three principal features revealed by the PHANGS-HST cluster sample: the young cluster locus, the middle-age plume, and the old globular cluster clump. We present an atlas of maps of the 2D spatial distribution of clusters and compact associations in the context of the molecular clouds from PHANGS-ALMA. We explore new ways of understanding this large dataset in a multi-scale context by bringing together once-separate techniques for the characterization of clusters (color-color diagrams and spatial distributions) and their parent galaxies (galaxy morphology and location relative to the galaxy main sequence). A companion paper presents the physical properties: ages, masses, and dust reddenings derived using improved spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting techniques. |

|**Abstract**| The old nova and intermediate polar (IP) GK Persei underwent one of its recurrent dwarf nova (DN) outbursts in 2018. We proposed monitoring it in UV and X-rays with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, starting less than six days after the eruption, until 16 days after the eruption ended. For the first time we could follow the decay to minimum light UV and X-rays. We present the timing and spectral analysis, comparing the results with the previous outbursts and with the quiescent status. We confirm the spin modulation in X-rays with a period 351.325(9) s, only in the 2-10 keV range. The period was not detected in the 0.3-2 keV range and in the UV band, suggesting that the soft portion of the X-ray spectrum in GK Per does not originate near the poles, but in a wind or circumstellar material. The amplitude of the modulation was less prominent than in 2015, a fact that seems correlated with a lower average mass accretion rate. The spectral fits are consistent with a mass accretion rate increasing by a factor of 2 from rise to maximum and decreasing during the return to minimum, following the trend of the modulation amplitude. The maximum plasma temperature is higher than the Swift XRT energy range of 0.3-10 keV, thus it is not well constrained, but our spectral fits indicate that it may have varied irregularly during the outburst. |
