|**Abstract**|            Fragmentation contributes to the formation and evolution of stars. Observationally, high-mass stars are known to form multiple-star systems, preferentially in cluster environments. Theoretically, Jeans instability has been suggested to determine characteristic fragmentation scales, and thermal or turbulent motion in the parental gas clump mainly contributes to the instability. To search for such a characteristic fragmentation scale, we have analyzed ALMA 1.33 mm continuum observations toward 30 high-mass star-forming clumps taken by the Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA) survey. We have identified 573 cores using the dendrogram algorithm and measured the separation of cores by using the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) technique. The core separation corrected by projection effects has a distribution peaked around 5800 au. In order to remove biases produced by different distances and sensitivities, we further smooth the images to a common physical scale and perform completeness tests. Our careful analysis finds a characteristic fragmentation scale of $\sim$7000 au, comparable to the thermal Jeans length of the clumps. We conclude that thermal Jeans fragmentation plays a dominant role in determining the clump fragmentation in high-mass star-forming regions, without the need of invoking turbulent Jeans fragmentation.         |

|**Abstract**|            We explore the feasibility of using machine-learning regression as a method of extracting basic stellar parameters and line-of-sight extinctions, given spectro-photometric data. To this end, we build a stable gradient-boosted random-forest regressor (xgboost), trained on spectroscopic data, capable of producing output parameters with reliable uncertainties from Gaia DR3 data (most notably the low-resolution XP spectra) without ground-based spectroscopic observations. Using Shapley additive explanations, we are able to interpret how the predictions for each star are influenced by each data feature. For the training and testing of the network, we use high-quality parameters obtained from the StarHorse code for a sample of around eight million stars observed by major spectroscopic surveys (APOGEE, GALAH, LAMOST, RAVE, SEGUE, and GES), complemented by curated samples of hot stars, very metal-poor stars, white dwarfs, and hot sub-dwarfs. The training data cover the whole sky, all Galactic components, and almost the full magnitude range of the Gaia DR3 XP sample of more than 217 million objects that also have parallaxes. We achieve median uncertainties (at $G\approx16$) of 0.20 mag in V-band extinction, 0.01 dex in logarithmic effective temperature, 0.20 dex in surface gravity, 0.18 dex in metallicity, and $12\%$ in mass (over the full Gaia DR3 XP sample, with considerable variations in precision as a function of magnitude and stellar type). We succeed in predicting competitive results based on Gaia DR3 XP spectra compared to classical isochrone fitting methods we employed in earlier work, especially for the parameters $A_V$, $T_{\rm eff}$, and metallicity. Finally, we showcase some applications of this new catalogue (e.g. extinction maps, metallicity trends in the Milky Way, extended maps of young massive stars, metal-poor stars, and metal-rich stars).

|| P. Rekhi, et al. -- incl., <mark>H.-W. Rix</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-07-10*|
|*Comments*| *12 pages, 10 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            A large population of intermediate-separation binaries, consisting of a main-sequence (MS) star and a white dwarf (WD), has recently emerged from Gaia's third data release (DR3), posing challenges to current models of binary evolution. Here we examine the $s$-process element abundances in these systems using data from GALAH DR3. Following refined sample analysis with parameter estimates based on GALAH spectra, we find a distinct locus where enhanced $s$-process elements depend on both the WD mass and metallicity, consistent with loci identified in previous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) nucleosynthesis studies with higher $s$-process yields. Notably, these enhanced abundances show no correlation with the systems' orbital parameters, supporting a history of accretion in intermediate-separation MS+WD systems. Consequently, our results form a direct observational evidence of a connection between AGB masses and $s$-process yields. We conclude by showing that the GALAH DR3 survey includes numerous Ba dwarf stars, within and beyond the mass range covered in our current sample, which can further elucidate $s$-process element distributions in MS+WD binaries.         |

|| C. Shariat, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. El-Badry</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-07-10*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted to ApJ. Comments are welcome*|
|**Abstract**|            More than half of all main-sequence (MS) stars have one or more companions, and many of those with initial masses <8 M$_\odot$ are born in hierarchical triples. These systems feature two stars in a close orbit (the inner binary) while a tertiary star orbits them on a wider orbit (the outer binary). In hierarchical triples, three-body dynamics combined with stellar evolution drives interactions and, in many cases, merges the inner binary entirely to create a renovated `Post-Merger Binary' (PMB). By leveraging dynamical simulations and tracking binary interactions, we explore the outcomes of merged triples and investigate whether PMBs preserve signatures of their three-body history. Our findings indicate that in 26-54% of wide double WD binaries (s>100 au), the more massive white dwarf (WD) is a merger product, implying that these DWD binaries were previously triples. Overall, we estimate that $44\pm14\%$ of observed wide DWDs originated in triple star systems and thereby have rich dynamical histories. Additionally, our results suggest that the separations of inner and outer binaries are uncorrelated at birth, providing insights into stellar formation processes. We also examine MS+MS and MS+Red Giant mergers manifesting as Blue Straggler stars (BSSs). These PMBs have orbital configurations and ages similar to most observed BSS binaries. While the triple+merger formation channel can explain the observed chemical abundances, moderate eccentricities, and companion masses in BSS binaries, it likely only accounts for $\sim$20-25% of BSSs. Meanwhile, we predict that the majority of observed single BSSs formed as collisions in triples and harbor long-period (>10 yr) companions. Furthermore, both BSS binaries and DWDs exhibit signatures of WD birth kicks.         |

|| L. Rampinelli, et al. -- incl., <mark>M. Benisty</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-07-10*|
|*Comments*| *25 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, 8 figures and one table in appendix. Accepted for publication in A&A*|
|**Abstract**|            With two directly detected protoplanets, the PDS 70 system is a unique source in which to study the complex interplay between forming planets and their natal environment. The large dust cavity carved by the two giant planets can affect the disk chemistry, and therefore the molecular emission morphology. On the other hand, chemical properties of the gas component of the disk are expected to leave an imprint on the planetary atmospheres. In this work, we reconstruct the emission morphology of a rich inventory of molecular tracers in the PDS 70 disk, and we look for possible chemical signatures of the two actively accreting protoplanets, PDS b and c. We leverage Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 6 high-angular-resolution and deep-sensitivity line emission observations, together with image and $uv$-plane techniques, to boost the detection of faint lines. We robustly detect ring-shaped emission from $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, H$^{13}$CN, HC$^{15}$N, DCN, H$_2$CO, CS, C$_2$H, and H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ lines in unprecedented detail. Most of the molecular tracers show a peak of the emission inside the millimeter dust peak. We interpret this as the direct impact of the effective irradiation of the cavity wall, as a result of the planet formation process. Moreover, we have found evidence of an O-poor gas reservoir in the outer disk, which is supported by the observations of bright C-rich molecules, the non-detection of SO, and a lower limit on the $\mathrm{CS/SO}$ ratio of $\sim1$. Eventually, we provide the first detection of the c-C$_3$H$_2$ transitions at 218.73 GHz, and the marginal detection of an azimuthal asymmetry in the higher-energy H$_2$CO (3$_{2,1}$-2$_{2,0}$) line, which could be due to accretion heating near PDS 70b.         |

|| E. Lee, et al. -- incl., <mark>R. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-07-10*|
|*Comments*| *15 pages, 12 figures, SPIE Astronomical Telescopes + Instrumentation: Adaptive Optics Systems IX*|
|**Abstract**|            We are developing an adaptive secondary mirror (ASM) that uses a new actuator technology created by the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO). The TNO hybrid variable reluctance actuators have more than an order of magnitude better efficiency over the traditional voice coil actuators that have been used on existing ASMs and show potential for improving the long-term robustness and reliability of ASMs. To demonstrate the performance, operations, and serviceability of TNO's actuators in an observatory, we have developed a 36-actuator prototype ASM for the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) called IRTF-ASM-1. IRTF-ASM-1 provides the first on-sky demonstration of this approach and will help us evaluate the long-term performance and use of this technology in an astronomical facility environment. We present calibration and performance results with the ASM in a Meniscus Hindle Sphere lens setup as well as preliminary on-sky results on IRTF. IRTF-ASM-1 achieved stable closed-loop performance on-sky with H-band Strehl ratios of 35-40% in long-exposure images under a variety of seeing conditions.         |

|| P. A. Collaboration, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-07-10*|
|*Comments*| *submitted to ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays are known to be mainly of extragalactic origin, and their propagation is limited by energy losses, so their arrival directions are expected to correlate with the large-scale structure of the local Universe. In this work, we investigate the possible presence of intermediate-scale excesses in the flux of the most energetic cosmic rays from the direction of the supergalactic plane region using events with energies above 20 EeV recorded with the surface detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory up to 31 December 2022, with a total exposure of 135,000 km^2 sr yr. The strongest indication for an excess that we find, with a post-trial significance of 3.1{\sigma}, is in the Centaurus region, as in our previous reports, and it extends down to lower energies than previously studied. We do not find any strong hints of excesses from any other region of the supergalactic plane at the same angular scale. In particular, our results do not confirm the reports by the Telescope Array collaboration of excesses from two regions in the Northern Hemisphere at the edge of the field of view of the Pierre Auger Observatory. With a comparable exposure, our results in those regions are in good agreement with the expectations from an isotropic distribution.         |
