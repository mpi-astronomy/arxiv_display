|| <mark>X. Zhang</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-04-25*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            It is demonstrated that estimators of the angular power spectrum commonly used for the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) lack a closed-form analytical expression for the likelihood function and, typically, cannot be accurately approximated by a Gaussian likelihood. Nevertheless, a robust statistical analysis can be performed by extending the framework outlined in \cite{PRL} to enable the estimation and testing of angular power spectral models for the SGWB without specifying distributional assumptions. Here, the technical aspects of the method are discussed in detail. Moreover, a new, consistent estimator for the covariance of the angular power spectrum is derived. The proposed approach is applied to data from the third observing run (O3) of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo.         |

|| C. Yang, <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            As the lifetime of a black hole decreases, the energy of the Hawking radiation it emits increases, ultimately culminating in its disappearance through a powerful burst of gamma rays. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with an initial mass of $\sim 5\times10^{14}$ g, their lifespans are expected to end in the present epoch. Detecting such PBH bursts would provide compelling evidence of their existence. The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) has the potential to observe these bursts at the high-energy end of the gamma-ray spectrum. To investigate this possibility, we conduct a study to evaluate the sensitivity of CTA to the local burst rate density of PBHs. Our results suggest that during a 5-year observational campaign, CTA could exclude a local burst rate density exceeding $\sim 36\ \mathrm{pc}^{-3}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which represents an improvement of one order of magnitude over the upper limit set by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). In addition, we propose an observation strategy optimized for detecting PBH bursts.         |

|| G. Carvalho-Silva, et al. -- incl., <mark>G. Martos</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-04-25*|

|**Abstract**|            Determining stellar ages is challenging, particularly for cooler main-sequence stars. Magnetic evolution offers an observational alternative for age estimation via the age-chromospheric activity (AC) relation. We evaluate the impact of metallicity on this relation using near one-solar-mass stars across a wide metallicity range. We analyze a sample of 358 solar-type stars with precise spectroscopic parameters determined through a line-by-line differential technique and with ages derived using Yonsei-Yale isochrones. We measured chromospheric activity (S-index) using high-quality HARPS spectra, calibrated to the Mount Wilson system, and converted to the $R^{\prime}_{\mathrm HK}(T_{\mathrm{eff}})$ index with a temperature-based photospheric correction. Our findings show that the AC relation for $R^{\prime}_{\mathrm HK}(T_{\mathrm{eff}})$ is strongly influenced by metallicity. We propose a new age-activity-metallicity relation for solar-type main-sequence (MS) stars ($\log{g} \gtrsim 4.2 $) with temperatures 5370 $\lesssim$ $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ $\lesssim$ 6530 K and metallicities from -0.7 to +0.3 dex. We show that taking metallicity into account significantly enhances chromospheric ages' reliability, reducing the residuals' root mean square (RMS) relative to isochronal ages from 2.6 Gyr to 0.92 Gyr. This reflects a considerable improvement in the errors of chromospheric ages, from 53\% to 15\%. The precision level achieved in this work is also consistent with previous age-activity calibration from our group using solar twins.         |

|| G. P. Srinivasaragavan, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            We present optical, radio, and X-ray observations of EP250108a/SN 2025kg, a broad-line Type Ic supernova (SN Ic-BL) accompanying an Einstein Probe (EP) fast X-ray transient (FXT) at $z=0.176$. EP250108a/SN 2025kg possesses a double-peaked optical light curve and its spectrum transitions from a blue underlying continuum to a typical SN Ic-BL spectrum over time. We fit a radioactive decay model to the second peak of the optical light curve and find SN parameters that are consistent with the SNe Ic-BL population, while its X-ray and radio properties are consistent with those of low-luminosity GRB (LLGRB) 060218/SN 2006aj. We explore three scenarios to understand the system's multi-wavelength emission -- (a) SN ejecta interacting with an extended circumstellar medium (CSM), (b) the shocked cocoon of a collapsar-driven jet choked in its stellar envelope, and (c) the shocked cocoon of a collapsar-driven jet choked in an extended CSM. All three models can explain the optical light curve and are also consistent with the radio and X-ray observations. We favor models (a) and (c) because they self-consistently explain both the X-ray prompt emission and first optical peak, but we do not rule out model (b). From the properties of the first peak in models (a) and (c), we find evidence that EP250108a/SN 2025kg interacts with an extended CSM, and infer an envelope mass $M_{\rm e} \sim 0.1\,\rm M_\odot$ and radius $R_{\rm e} \sim 4 \times 10^{13}$ cm. EP250108a/SN 2025kg's multi-wavelength properties make it a close analog to LLGRB 060218/SN 2006aj, and highlight the power of early follow-up observations in mapping the environments of massive stars prior to core collapse.         |

|**Abstract**|            In the third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detector era, GW multi-messenger observations for binary neutron star merger events can exert great impacts on exploring the cosmic expansion history. Extending the previous work, we explore the potential of 3G GW standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimation by considering their associated electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, including $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) coincidence observations by the Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor and GW-triggered target-of-opportunity observations of kilonovae by different optical survey projects. During an assumed 10-year observation, we predict that the number of detectable GW-kilonova events is $\sim 4900$ with redshifts below $\sim 0.4$ under GW network and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope in the $i$ band, which is three times more than that of GW-GRB detections. For the cosmological analysis, we find that with the inclusion of GW-kilonova detections, the constraints on cosmological parameters from GW-EM detections are significantly improved compared to those from GW-GRB detections. In particular, GW-EM detections can tightly constrain the Hubble constant with a precision ranging from $0.076\%$ to $0.034\%$. Moreover, GW multi-messenger observations could effectively break the cosmological parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB+BAO+SN (CBS). The combination of CBS and GW-EM can tightly constrain the equation of state parameters of dark energy $w$ in the $w$CDM model and $w_0$ in the $w_0w_a$CDM model with precisions of $0.72\%$ and $0.99\%$, respectively, meeting the standard of precision cosmology. In conclusion, GW multi-messenger observations could play a crucial role in helping solve the Hubble tension and probing the fundamental nature of dark energy.         |
