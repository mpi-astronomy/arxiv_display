|**Abstract**|            We present a new epoch of JWST spectroscopic variability monitoring of the benchmark binary brown dwarf WISE 1049AB, the closest, brightest brown dwarfs known. Our 8-hour MIRI low resolution spectroscopy (LRS) and 7-hour NIRSpec prism observations extended variability measurements for any brown dwarfs beyond 11 $\mu$m for the first time, reaching up to 14 $\mu$m. Combined with the previous epoch in 2023, they set the longest JWST weather monitoring baseline to date. We found that both WISE 1049AB show wavelength-dependent light curve behaviours. Using a robust k-means clustering algorithm, we identified several clusters of variability behaviours associated with three distinct pressure levels. By comparing to a general circulation model (GCM), we identified the possible mechanisms that drive the variability at these pressure levels: Patchy clouds rotating in and out of view likely shaped the dramatic light curves in the deepest layers between 1-2.5 $\mu$m, whereas hot spots arising from temperature / chemical variations of molecular species likely dominate the high-altitude levels between 2.5-3.6 $\mu$m and 4.3-8.5 $\mu$m. Small-grain silicates potentially contributed to the variability of WISE 1049A at 8.5-11 $\mu$m. While distinct atmospheric layers are governed by different mechanisms, we confirmed for the first time that each variability mechanism remains consistent within its layer over the long term. Future multi-period observations will further test the stability of variability mechanisms on this binary, and expanded JWST variability surveys across the L-T-Y sequence will allow us to trace and understand variability mechanisms across a wider population of brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects.         |
