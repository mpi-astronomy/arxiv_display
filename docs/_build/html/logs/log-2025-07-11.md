|**Abstract**|            The Euclid space telescope of the European Space Agency (ESA) is designed to provide sensitive and accurate measurements of weak gravitational lensing distortions over wide areas on the sky. Here we present a weak gravitational lensing analysis of early Euclid observations obtained for the field around the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2390 as part of the Euclid Early Release Observations programme. We conduct galaxy shape measurements using three independent algorithms (LensMC, KSB+, and SourceXtractor++). Incorporating multi-band photometry from Euclid and Subaru/Suprime-Cam, we estimate photometric redshifts to preferentially select background sources from tomographic redshift bins, for which we calibrate the redshift distributions using the self-organising map approach and data from the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS). We quantify the residual cluster member contamination and correct for it in bins of photometric redshift and magnitude using their source density profiles, including corrections for source obscuration and magnification. We reconstruct the cluster mass distribution and jointly fit the tangential reduced shear profiles of the different tomographic bins with spherical Navarro--Frenk--White profile predictions to constrain the cluster mass, finding consistent results for the three shape catalogues and good agreement with earlier measurements. As an important validation test we compare these joint constraints to mass measurements obtained individually for the different tomographic bins, finding good consistency. More detailed constraints on the cluster properties are presented in a companion paper that additionally incorporates strong lensing measurements. Our analysis provides a first demonstration of the outstanding capabilities of Euclid for tomographic weak lensing measurements.         |

|**Abstract**|            We performed deep X-ray observations of the Virgo cluster using the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope (EP-FXT) with a total exposure of 295 ks. Leveraging the large field of view (FoV) and low particle background of EP-FXT, the image reveals a giant spiral feature connecting the cold fronts in the northwest and southeast, forming a coherent structure consistent with earlier results from XMM-Newton and Suzaku. We also present two-dimensional maps of temperature, metallicity, and entropy across the Virgo Cluster, covering a FoV of approximately 28.5 arcmin. These maps clearly show a spiral structure with high density, low temperature, high metallicity, and low entropy. The results support a scenario where the spiral morphology arises from gas sloshing driven by a minor merger. Additionally, EP-FXT temperature measurements agree well with XMM-Newton data within uncertainties.         |

|| T.-N. Li, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-11*|

|**Abstract**|            Recent observations of DESI hint that dark matter (DM) may not be cold but have a non-zero equation of state (EoS) parameter, and that dark energy (DE) may not be a cosmological constant. In this work, we explore the possibility of a non-zero DM EoS parameter within the framework of dynamical DE. We perform analysis by using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR2, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, and the type Ia supernova (SN) data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus. When using the combination of CMB, BAO, and SN data, our results indicate a preference for a non-zero DM EoS parameter at the $2.8\sigma$ and $3.3\sigma$ level within the content of a constant DE EoS. In contrast, for a time-evolving DE EoS parameterized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, this preference decreases to $0.8\sigma$ and $1.1\sigma$. Furthermore, allowing a non-zero DM EoS yields best-fit values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ that exhibit smaller deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM expectations, and Bayesian evidence analysis shows a comparable preference for this model relative to $\Lambda$CDM. The overall results of this work indicate that a non-zero DM EoS parameter warrants further exploration and investigation.         |
