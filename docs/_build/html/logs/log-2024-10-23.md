|**Abstract**|            Gaia characterizes the stellar populations of nearby open clusters with unprecedented precision. We investigate the Böhm-Vitense gap, which has been found as a prominent feature in the stellar sequence of open clusters. Using PARSEC isochrone fitting, we derive astrophysical parameters for more than 1100 stars in Praesepe, identify more than 1100 bona fide single stars in the alpha Persei (Melotte 20) open cluster, and confirm their approximate match in terms of age (approx. 710 Myr and 45 Myr) and metallicity ([M/H] approx. +0.15 dex and +0.13 dex) to the Hyades and Pleiades, respectively. By merging data of the cluster pairs, we improve number statistics. We do not find a clear gap in the combined observational G_abs vs. BP-RP color-magnitude diagram (CMD) in the stellar mass range corresponding to the location of the Böhm-Vitense gap. We reproduce gaps in simulated Hyades-type CMDs randomly drawn from an initial mass function. There is no strong evidence for a discontinuity originating in the transition from radiative to convective energy transport in the stellar photosphere. We conclude that the observed gaps in the stellar sequences of open clusters could be explained by small number statistics and the uneven mass-color relation at the transition from spectral type A to F.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present archival HST and JWST ultraviolet through near infrared time series photometric observations of a massive minimal-contact binary candidate in the metal-poor galaxy WLM ($Z = 0.14 Z_{\odot}$). This discovery marks the lowest metallicity contact binary candidate observed to date. We determine the nature of the two stars in the binary by using the eclipsing binary modeling software (PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs; PHOEBE) to train a neural network to fit our observed panchromatic multi-epoch photometry. The best fit model consists of two hot MS stars ($T_1=29800^{+2300}_{-1700}$ K, $M_1=16^{+2}_{-3}~M_{\odot}$, and $T_2=18000^{+5000}_{-5000}$ K, $M_2=7^{+5}_{-3}~M_{\odot}$). We discuss plausible evolutionary paths for the system, and suggest the system is likely to be currently in a contact phase before ultimately ending in a merger. Future spectroscopy will help to further narrow down evolutionary pathways. This work showcases a novel use of data of JWST and HST imaging originally taken to characterize RR Lyrae. We expect time series imaging from LSST, BlackGEM, etc. to uncover similar types of objects in nearby galaxies.         |
