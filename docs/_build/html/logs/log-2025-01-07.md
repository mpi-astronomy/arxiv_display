|**Abstract**|            Our brains are hardwired for pattern recognition as correlations are useful for predicting and understanding nature. As more exoplanet atmospheres are being characterized with JWST, we are starting to unveil their properties on a population level. Here we present a framework for comparing exoplanet transmission spectroscopy from 3 to 5$\mu$m with four bands: L (2.9 - 3.7$\mu$m), SO$_2$ (3.95 - 4.1$\mu$m), CO$_2$ (4.25 - 4.4$\mu$m) and CO (4.5 - 4.9$\mu$m). Together, the four bands cover the major carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur-bearing molecules including H$_2$O, CH$_4$, NH$_3$, H$_2$S, SO$_2$, CO$_2$, and CO. Among the eight high-precision gas giant exoplanet planet spectra we collected, we found strong correlations between the SO$_2$-L index and planet mass (r=-0.41$\pm$0.09) and temperature (r=-0.64$\pm$0.08), indicating SO$_2$ preferably exists (SO$_2$-L$>$-0.5) among low mass ($\sim<$0.3M$_J$) and cooler ($\sim<$1200K) targets. We also observe strong temperature dependency for both CO$_2$-L and CO-L indices. Under equilibrium chemistry and isothermal thermal structure assumptions, we find that the planet sample favors super-solar metallicity and low C/O ratio ($<$0.7). In addition, the presence of a mass-metallicity correlation is favored over uniform metallicity with the eight planets. We further introduce the SO$_2$-L versus CO$_2$-L diagram alike the color-magnitude diagram for stars and brown dwarfs. All reported trends here will be testable and be further quantified with existing and future JWST observations within the next few years.         |

|**Abstract**|            The total deuterium abundance [D/H] in the universe is set by just two processes: the creation of deuterium in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis at an abundance of [D/H]$=2.58\pm0.13\times10^{-5}$, and its destruction within stellar interiors. Measurements of the total [D/H] abundance can potentially provide a probe of Galactic chemical evolution, however, most measurements of [D/H] are only sensitive to the gas-phase deuterium, and the amount of deuterium sequestered in carbonaceous dust grains is debated. With the launch of JWST, it is now possible to measure the gas-phase [D/H] at unprecedented sensitivity and distances through observation of mid-IR lines of H$_2$ and HD. We employ data from the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS) program to measure the gas-phase [D/H] abundance with a rotation diagram analysis towards 5 nearby low-mass and 5 distant high-mass protostellar outflows. The gas-phase [D/H] varies between low-mass sources by up to a factor of $\sim4$, despite these sources likely having formed in a region of the Galactic disk that would be expected to have nearly constant total [D/H]. Most measurements of gas-phase [D/H] from our work or previous studies produce [D/H] $\lesssim 1.0\times10^{-5}$, a factor of $2-4$ lower than found from local UV absorption lines and as expected from Galactic chemical evolution models. The variations in [D/H] between our low-mass sources and the low [D/H] with respect to Galactic chemical evolution models suggest that our observations are not sensitive to the total [D/H]. Significant depletion of deuterium onto carbonaceous dust grains is a possible explanation, and tentative evidence of enhanced [D/H] towards shock positions with higher gas-phase Fe abundance is seen in the HH 211 outflow. Deeper observations of HD and H$_2$ in shocked environments and modelling of dust-grain destruction are warranted to test for the effects of depletion.         |

|**Abstract**|            Spectroscopic observations of various tracers in nearby galaxies, such as Andromeda (M31), play a crucial role in identifying and classifying individual stellar populations and nebular objects, thereby enhancing our understanding of galactic composition, environment, and dynamics as well as stellar evolution. While the LAMOST (Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope) survey of M31 has produced extensive datasets, a comprehensive catalog of emission-line nebulae, star clusters, and supergiants is yet to be completed. In this paper, we present a final catalog of 384 emission-line nebulae, 380 star clusters, and 375 supergiants and candidates in M31, as carefully selected and identified from the LAMOST spectroscopic database. These objects were classified using a random forest algorithm, followed by thorough visual examinations of their spectral characteristics as well as morphologies revealed by archive images. For emission-line nebulae, we measured radial velocities and relative fluxes of emission lines, enabling further classification of planetary nebulae and HII regions. Additionally, we identified 245 emission-line nebulae in M33. This work lays the data foundation for the study of M31, and offers valuable tracers to investigate M31's structure and evolution.         |

|**Abstract**|            The diffuse gamma-ray emission from the Milky Way serves as a crucial probe for understanding the propagation and interactions of cosmic rays within our galaxy. The Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission between 10 TeV and 1 PeV has been recently measured by the square kilometer array (KM2A) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). The flux is higher than predicted for cosmic rays interacting with the interstellar medium. In this work, we utilize a non-parametric method to derive the source count distribution using the published first LHAASO source catalog. Based on this distribution, we calculate the contribution of unresolved sources to the diffuse emission measured by KM2A. When comparing our results to the measured diffuse gamma-ray emission, we demonstrate that for the outer Galactic region, the contributions from unresolved sources and those predicted by models are roughly consistent with experimental observations within the uncertainty. However, for the inner Galactic region, additional components are required to account for the observed data.         |
