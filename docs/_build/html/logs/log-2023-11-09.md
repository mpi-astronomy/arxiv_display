|**Abstract**| Context. Recent observations of close detached eclipsing M and K dwarf binaries have provided substantial support for magnetic saturation when stars rotate sufficiently fast, leading to a magnetic braking (MB) torque proportional to the spin of the star. Aims. We investigated here how strong MB torques need to be to reproduce the observationally-inferred relative numbers of white dwarf plus M dwarf post-common-envelope binaries under the assumption of magnetic saturation. Methods. We carried out binary population simulations with the BSE code adopting empirically-derived inter-correlated main-sequence binary distributions as initial binary populations and compared the simulation outcomes with observations. Results. We found that the dearth of extreme mass ratio binaries in the inter-correlated initial distributions is key to reproduce the large fraction of post-common-envelope binaries hosting low-mass M dwarfs (${\sim0.1-0.2}$ M$_\odot$). In addition, orbital angular momentum loss rates due to MB should be high for M dwarfs with radiative cores and orders of magnitude smaller for fully convective stars to explain the observed dramatic change of the fraction of short-period binaries at the fully convective boundary. Conclusions. We conclude that saturated but disrupted, that is, dropping drastically at the fully convective boundary, MB can explain the observations of both close main-sequence binaries containing M and K dwarfs and post-common-envelope binaries. Whether a similar prescription can explain the spin down rates of single stars and of binaries containing more massive stars needs to be tested. |

|**Abstract**| Semi-numerical models of reionization typically involve a large number of unknown parameters whose values are constrained by comparing with observations. Increasingly often, exploring this parameter space using semi-numerical simulations can become computationally intensive, thus necessitating the use of emulators. In this work, we present a likelihood emulator based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for our semi-numerical reionization code, SCRIPT, and use it for parameter inference using mock 21 cm power spectrum data and Bayesian MCMC analysis. A unique aspect of our methodology is the utilization of coarse resolution simulations to identify high-probability regions within the parameter space, employing only a moderate amount of computational time. Samples drawn from these high-probability regions are used to construct the training set for the emulator. The subsequent MCMC using this GPR-trained emulator is found to provide parameter posteriors that agree reasonably well with those obtained using conventional MCMC. The computing time for the analysis, which includes both generation of training sets and training the emulator, is reduced by approximately an order of magnitude. This methodology is particularly advantageous in scenarios where one wants to use different parametrizations of reionization models and/or needs to start with broad prior distributions on the parameters, offering an efficient and effective means of parameter inference. |

|**Abstract**| Lightcurves of many classical novae deviate from the canonical "fast rise - smooth decline" pattern and display complex variability behavior. We present the first TESS-space-photometry-based investigation of this phenomenon. We use TESS Sector 41 full-frame images to extract a lightcurve of the slow Galactic nova V606 Vul that erupted nine days prior to the start of the TESS observations. The lightcurve covers the first of two major peaks of V606 Vul that was reached 19 days after the start of the eruption. The nova reached its brightest visual magnitude V=9.9 in its second peak 64 days after the eruption onset, following the completion of Sector 41 observations. To increase the confidence level of the extracted lightcurve, we performed the analysis using four different codes implementing the aperture photometry (Lightkurve, VaST) and image subtraction (TESSreduce, tequila_shots) and find good agreement between them. We performed ground-based photometric and spectroscopic monitoring to complement the TESS data. The TESS lightcurve reveals two features: periodic variations (0.12771d, 0.01mag average peak-to-peak amplitude) that disappeared when the source was within 1mag of peak optical brightness and a series of isolated mini-flares (with peak-to-peak amplitudes of up to 0.5mag) appearing at seemingly random times. We interpret the periodic variations as the result of azimuthal asymmetry of the photosphere engulfing the nova-hosting binary that was distorted by and rotating with the binary. Whereas we use spectra to associate the two major peaks in the nova lightcurve with distinct episodes of mass ejection, the origin of mini-flares remains elusive. |

|**Abstract**| In this work, we update and develop algorithms for KMTNet tender-love care (TLC) photometry in order to create an new, mostly automated, TLC pipeline. We then start a project to systematically apply the new TLC pipeline to the historic KMTNet microlensing events, and search for buried planetary signals. We report the discovery of such a planet candidate in the microlensing event MOA-2019-BLG-421/KMT-2019-BLG-2991. The anomalous signal can be explained by either a planet around the lens star or the orbital motion of the source star. For the planetary interpretation, despite many degenerate solutions, the planet is most likely to be a Jovian planet orbiting an M or K dwarf, which is a typical microlensing planet. The discovery proves that the project can indeed increase the sensitivity of historic events and find previously undiscovered signals. |
