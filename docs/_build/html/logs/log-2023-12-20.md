|**Abstract**| Context: The Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) has been providing breakthrough images of the dust in the central parsecs of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), thought to be a key component of the AGN unification scheme and AGN host galaxy interaction. In single infrared bands, these images can have multiple interpretations some of which could challenge the unification scheme. This is the case for the archetypal type 2 AGN of NGC1068. The degeneracy is reduced by multi-band temperature maps which are hindered by ambiguity in alignment between different single band images. Aims: To solve this problem by creating a chromatic model capable of simultaneously explaining the VLTI GRAVITY+MATISSE $2\mu$m$-13\mu$m observations of the AGN hosted by NGC1068. Methods: We employ a simple disk and wind geometry populated with black body emitters and dust obscuration to create a versatile multi-wavelength modelling method for chromatic IR interferometric data of dusty objects. Results: This simple geometry is capable of reproducing the spectro-interferometric data of NGC1068 from K$-$N-band, explains the complex single band images with obscuration and inclination effects, and solves the alignment problem between bands. We find that the resulting inclination and position angle of the model is consistent with those inferred in previous larger scale studies of the narrow line region. Furthermore, the resulting model images visually resemble the multiple achromatic image reconstructions of the same data when evaluated at the same wavelengths. We conclude that the AGN of NGC1068 can indeed be explained by the clumpy disk+wind iteration of the AGN unification scheme. Within the scheme, we find that it is best explained as a type 2 AGN and the obscuring dust chemistry can be explained by a mix of olivine silicates and $16\pm1\%$ amorphous carbon. |

|**Abstract**| We present the robust selection of quiescent (QG) and post-starburst (PSB) galaxies using ultra-deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). Key to this is MIRI 7.7$\mu$m imaging which breaks the degeneracy between old stellar populations and dust attenuation at $3<z<6$ by providing rest-frame $J$-band. Using this, we identify 23 passively evolving galaxies in UVJ color space in a mass-limited (log $M_{\star}/M_{\odot}\geq8.5$) sample over 8.8 arcmin$^2$. Evaluation of this selection with and without 7.7$\,\mu$m shows that dense wavelength coverage with NIRCam ($8-11$ bands including $1-4$ medium-bands) can compensate for lacking the $J-$band anchor, meaning that robust selection of high-redshift QGs is possible with NIRCam alone. Our sample is characterized by rapid quenching timescales ($\sim100-600$ Myr) with formation redshifts $z_{\rm f}\lesssim8.5$ and includes a potential record-holding massive QG at $z_{\rm phot}=5.33_{-0.17}^{+0.16}$ and two QGs with evidence for significant residual dust content ($A_{\rm V}\sim1-2$). In addition, we present a large sample of 12 log $M_{\star}/M_{\odot}=8.5-9.5$ PSBs, demonstrating that UVJ selection can be extended to low mass. Analysis of the environment of our sample reveals that the group known as the Cosmic Rose contains a massive QG and a dust-obscured star-forming galaxy (a so-called Jekyll and Hyde pair) plus three additional QGs within $\sim20$ kpc. Moreover, the Cosmic Rose is part of a larger overdensity at $z\sim3.7$ which contains 7/12 of our low-mass PSBs. Another 4 low-mass PSBs are members of an overdensity at $z\sim3.4$; this result strongly indicates low-mass PSBs are preferentially associated with overdense environments at $z>3$. |

|| <mark>Z. Kaczmarek</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-12-20*|

|**Abstract**| We analyze 1602 microlensing events found in the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) near-infrared (NIR) survey data. We obtain spatially-resolved, efficiency-corrected timescale distributions across the Galactic bulge ($|\ell|<10^\circ,$ $|b|<5^\circ$), using a Bayesian hierarchical model. Spatially-resolved peaks and means of the timescale distributions, along with their marginal distributions in strips of longitude and latitude, are in agreement at a 1$\sigma$ level with predictions based on the Besan\c{c}on model of the Galaxy. We find that the event timescales in the central bulge fields ($|\ell| < 5^\circ$) are on average shorter than the non-central ($|\ell| > 5^\circ$) fields, with the average peak of the lognormal timescale distribution at 23.6 $\pm$ 1.9 days for the central fields and 29.0 $\pm$ 3.0 days for the non-central fields. Our ability to probe the structure of the Bulge with this sample of NIR microlensing events is limited by the VVV survey's sparse cadence and relatively small number of detected microlensing events compared to dedicated optical surveys. Looking forward to future surveys, we investigate the capability of the Roman telescope to detect spatially-resolved asymmetries in the timescale distributions. We propose two pairs of Roman fields, centred on ($\ell = \pm 9,5^\circ$, $b=-0.125^\circ$) and ($\ell = -5^\circ$, $b=\pm 1.375^\circ$) as good targets to measure the asymmetry in longitude and latitude, respectively. |

|| J. Zhu, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-12-20*|

|**Abstract**| We propose a future mission concept, the MeV Astrophysical Spectroscopic Surveyor (MASS), which is a large area Compton telescope using 3D position sensitive cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) detectors optimized for emission line detection. The payload consists of two layers of CZT detectors in a misaligned chessboard layout, with a total geometric area of 4096 cm$^2$ for on-axis observations. The detectors can be operated at room-temperature with an energy resolution of 0.6\% at 0.662 MeV. The in-orbit background is estimated with a mass model. At energies around 1 MeV, a line sensitivity of about $10^{-5}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ can be obtained with a 1 Ms observation. The main science objectives of MASS include nucleosynthesis in astrophysics and high energy astrophysics related to compact objects and transient sources. The payload CZT detectors weigh roughly 40 kg, suggesting that it can be integrated into a micro- or mini-satellite. We have constructed a pathfinder, named as MASS-Cube, to have a direct test of the technique with 4 detector units in space in the near future. |

|| S. Cao, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. Lee</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-12-20*|

|**Abstract**| As one of the paradigm examples to probe into pulsar magnetospheric dynamics, PSR B0943+10 (J0946+0951) manifests representatively, showing mode switch, orthogonal polarization and subpulse drifting. Both integrated and single pulses are studied with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The mode switch phenomenon of this pulsar is studied using an eigen-mode searching method, based on parameter estimation. A phase space evolution for the pulsar's mode switch shows a strange-attractor-like pattern. The radiative geometry is proposed by fitting polarization position angles with the rotating vector model. The pulsar pulse profile is then mapped to the sparking location on pulsar surface, and the differences between the main pulse's and the precursor component's radiative process may explain the X-ray's synchronization with radio mode switch. Detailed single pulse studies on B0943+10's orthogonally polarized radiation are presented, which may support for certain models of radiative transfer of polarized emission. B0943+10's B and Q modes evolve differently with frequency and with proportions of orthogonal modes, which indicates possible magnetospheric changes during mode switch. An extra component is found in B mode, and it shows distinct polarization and modulation properties compared with main part of B mode pulse component. For Q mode pulse profile, the precursor and the main pulse components are orthogonally polarized, showing that the precursor component radiated farther from the pulsar could be radiated in O-mode (X-mode) if the main pulse originates from low altitude in X-mode (O-mode). The findings could impact significantly on pulsar electrodynamics and the radiative mechanism related. |

|| Y. Wang, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-12-20*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted to ApJ on 2023-06-13 (Currently after the first revision)*|
|**Abstract**| We re-examined the classification of the optical transient ASASSN-18ap, which was initially identified as a supernova (SNe) upon its discovery. Based on newly emerged phenomena, such as a delayed luminous infrared outburst and the emergence of luminous coronal emission lines, we suggest that ASASSN-18ap is more likely a tidal disruption event (TDE) in a dusty environment, rather than a supernova. The total energy in the infrared outburst is $\rm 3.1\times10^{51}$ erg, which is an order of magnitude higher than the total energy in the optical-to-ultraviolet range, indicating a large dust extinction, an extra-EUV component, or anisotropic continuum emission. A bumpy feature appeared in the optical light curve at the start of brightening, which was reported in a couple of TDEs very recently. This early bump may have been overlooked in the past due to the lack of sufficient sampling of the light curves of most TDEs during their ascending phase, and it could provide insight into the origin of optical emission. |

|| A. H. Edward, et al. -- incl., <mark>L. Xie</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-12-20*|
|*Comments*| *23 pages, 22 figures. Accepted for publication in MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**| We present an analysis of the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) of 14 known protoclusters between $2.0 < z < 2.5$ in the COSMOS field, down to a mass limit of $10^{9.5}$ M$_{\odot}$. We use existing photometric redshifts with a statistical background subtraction, and consider star-forming and quiescent galaxies identified from $(NUV - r)$ and $(r - J)$ colours separately. Our fiducial sample includes galaxies within 1 Mpc of the cluster centres. The shape of the protocluster SMF of star-forming galaxies is indistinguishable from that of the general field at this redshift. Quiescent galaxies, however, show a flatter SMF than in the field, with an upturn at low mass, though this is only significant at $\sim 2\sigma$. There is no strong evidence for a dominant population of quiescent galaxies at any mass, with a fraction of $< 15\%$ at $1\sigma$ confidence for galaxies with log$M_{\ast}/M_{\odot} < 10.5$. We compare our results with a sample of galaxies groups at $1 < z < 1.5$, and demonstrate that a significant amount of environmental quenching must take place between these epochs, increasing the relative abundance of high-mass ($\rm M > 10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$) quiescent galaxies by a factor of $\gtrsim$ 2. However, we find that at lower masses ($\rm M < 10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$), no additional environmental quenching is required. |
