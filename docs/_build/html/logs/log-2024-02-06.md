|**Abstract**| Protoclusters, the progenitors of galaxy clusters, trace large scale structures in the early Universe and are important to our understanding of structure formation and galaxy evolution. To date, only a handful of protoclusters have been identified in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). As one of the rarest populations in the early Universe, distant quasars that host active supermassive black holes are thought to reside in the most massive dark matter halos at that cosmic epoch, and could thus potentially pinpoint some of the earliest protoclusters. In this letter, we report the discovery of a massive protocluster around a luminous quasar at $z=6.63$. This protocluster is anchored by the quasar, and includes three [CII] emitters at $z\sim6.63$, 12 spectroscopically confirmed Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $6.54<z\le6.64$, and a large number of narrow-band imaging selected LAE candidates at the same redshift. This structure has an overall overdensity of $\delta=3.3^{+1.1}_{-0.9}$ within $\sim35\times74$ cMpc$^2$ on the sky and an extreme overdensity of $\delta>30$ in its central region (i.e., $R\lesssim2$ cMpc). We estimate that this protocluster will collapse into a galaxy cluster with a mass of $6.9^{+1.2}_{-1.4}\times10^{15}~M_\odot$ at the current epoch, more massive than the most massive clusters known in the local Universe such as Coma. In the quasar vicinity, we discover a double-peaked LAE which implies that the quasar has a UV lifetime greater than 0.8 Myrs and has already ionized its surrounding intergalactic medium. |

|**Abstract**| Context - Around the year 2000, Triton's south pole experienced an extreme summer solstice that occurs every about 650 years, when the subsolar latitude reached about 50{\deg}. Bracketing this epoch, a few occultations probed Triton's atmosphere in 1989, 1995, 1997, 2008 and 2017. A recent ground-based stellar occultation observed on 6 October 2022 provides a new measurement of Triton's atmospheric pressure which is presented here. Aims- The goal is to constrain the Volatile Transport Models (VTMs) of Triton's atmosphere that is basically in vapor pressure equilibrium with the nitrogen ice at its surface. Methods - Fits to the occultation light curves yield Triton's atmospheric pressure at the reference radius 1400 km, from which the surface pressure is induced. Results - The fits provide a pressure p_1400= 1.211 +/- 0.039 microbar at radius 1400 km (47 km altitude), from which a surface pressure of p_surf= 14.54 +/- 0.47 microbar is induced (1-sigma error bars). To within error bars, this is identical to the pressure derived from the previous occultation of 5 October 2017, p_1400 = 1.18 +/- 0.03 microbar and p_surf= 14.1 +/- 0.4 microbar, respectively. Based on recent models of Triton's volatile cycles, the overall evolution over the last 30 years of the surface pressure is consistent with N2 condensation taking place in the northern hemisphere. However, models typically predict a steady decrease in surface pressure for the period 2005-2060, which is not confirmed by this observation. Complex surface-atmosphere interactions, such as ice albedo runaway and formation of local N2 frosts in the equatorial regions of Triton could explain the relatively constant pressure between 2017 and 2022. |

|**Abstract**| Obscuration in high-redshift quasi-stellar objects (QSO) has a profound impact on our understanding of the evolution of supermassive black holes across the cosmic time. An accurate quantification of its relevance is therefore mandatory. We present a study aimed at evaluating the importance of obscuration in high redshift jetted QSO, i.e. those active nuclei characterized by the presence of powerful relativistic jets. We compare the observed number of radio detected QSO at different radio flux density limits with the value predicted by the beaming model on the basis of the number of oriented sources (blazars). Any significant deficit of radio-detected QSO compared to the predictions can be caused by the presence of obscuration along large angles from the jet direction. We apply this method to two sizable samples characterized by the same optical limit (mag=21) but significantly different radio density limits (30 mJy and 1 mJy respectively) and containing a total of 87 independent radio-loud 4<z<6.8 QSO, 31 of which classified as blazars. We find a general good agreement between the numbers predicted by the model and those actually observed, with only a marginal discrepancy at 0.5 mJy that could be caused by the lack of completeness of the sample. We conclude that we have no evidence of obscuration within angles 10-20deg from the relativistic jet direction. We also show how the ongoing deep wide-angle radio surveys will be instrumental to test the presence of obscuration at much larger angles, up to 30-35deg. We finally suggest that, depending on the actual fraction of obscured QSO, relativistic jets could be much more common at high redshifts compared to what is usually observed in the local Universe |
