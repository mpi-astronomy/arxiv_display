|**Abstract**| The Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) initiative aims to develop a space based mid-infrared (MIR) nulling interferometer to measure the thermal emission spectra of temperate terrestrial exoplanets. We investigate how well LIFE could characterize a cloudy Venus-twin exoplanet to: (1) test our retrieval routine on a realistic non-Earth-like MIR spectrum of a known planet, (2) investigate how clouds impact retrievals, (3) refine the LIFE requirements derived in previous Earth-centered studies. We run retrievals for simulated LIFE observations of a Venus-twin exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star located 10 pc from the observer. By assuming different models (cloudy and cloud-free) we analyze the performance as a function of the quality of the LIFE observation. This allows us to determine how well atmosphere and clouds are characterizable depending on the quality of the spectrum. Our study shows that the current minimal resolution ($R=50$) and signal-to-noise ($S/N=10$ at $11.2\mu$m) requirements for LIFE suffice to characterize the structure and composition of a Venus-like atmosphere above the cloud deck if an adequate model is chosen. However, we cannot infer cloud properties. The accuracy of the retrieved planet radius ($R_{pl}$), equilibrium temperature ($T_{eq}$), and Bond albedo ($A_B$) depend on the choice of model. Generally, a cloud-free model performs best and thus the presence of clouds cannot be inferred. This model dependence of retrieval results emphasizes the importance of developing a community-wide best-practice for atmospheric retrieval studies. If we consider higher quality spectra (especially $S/N=20$), we can infer the presence of clouds and pose first constraints on their structure. |

|**Abstract**| The increasing statistical power of cosmic microwave background (CMB) datasets requires a commensurate effort in understanding their noise properties. The noise in maps from ground-based instruments is dominated by large-scale correlations, which poses a modeling challenge. This paper develops novel models of the complex noise covariance structure in the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6 (ACT DR6) maps. We first enumerate the noise properties that arise from the combination of the atmosphere and the ACT scan strategy. We then prescribe a class of Gaussian, map-based noise models, including a new wavelet-based approach that uses directional wavelet kernels for modeling correlated instrumental noise. The models are empirical, whose only inputs are a small number of independent realizations of the same region of sky. We evaluate the performance of these models against the ACT DR6 data by drawing ensembles of noise realizations. Applying these simulations to the ACT DR6 power spectrum pipeline reveals a $\sim 20\%$ excess in the covariance matrix diagonal when compared to an analytic expression that assumes noise properties are uniquely described by their power spectrum. Along with our public code, $\mathtt{mnms}$, this work establishes a necessary element in the science pipelines of both ACT DR6 and future ground-based CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory (SO). |

|**Abstract**| We report a peculiar variable blue star in the globular cluster NGC 6397, using Hubble Space Telescope optical imaging. Its position in the colour-magnitude diagrams, and its spectrum, are consistent with this star being a helium core white dwarf (He WD) in a binary system. The optical light curve shows a periodicity at 18.5 hours. We argue that this periodicity is due to the rotation of the WD and possibly due to magnetic spots on the surface of the WD. This would make this object the first candidate magnetic He WD in any globular cluster (GC), and the first candidate magnetic WD in a detached binary system in any GC and one of the few He WDs with a known rotation period and of magnetic nature. Another possibility is that this system is a He WD in a binary system with another WD or another degenerate object, which would make this object one of the few candidate non-accreting double degenerate binaries in any GC. |

|**Abstract**| We present observations from X-ray to mid-infrared wavelengths of the most energetic non-quasar transient ever observed, AT2021lwx. Our data show a single optical brightening by a factor $>100$ to a luminosity of $7\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and a total radiated energy of $1.5\times10^{53}$ erg, both greater than any known optical transient. The decline is smooth and exponential and the ultra-violet - optical spectral energy distribution resembles a black body with temperature $1.2\times10^4$ K. Tentative X-ray detections indicate a secondary mode of emission, while a delayed mid-infrared flare points to the presence of dust surrounding the transient. The spectra are similar to recently discovered optical flares in known active galactic nuclei but lack some characteristic features. The lack of emission for the previous seven years is inconsistent with the short-term, stochastic variability observed in quasars, while the extreme luminosity and long timescale of the transient disfavour the disruption of a single solar-mass star. The luminosity could be generated by the disruption of a much more massive star, but the likelihood of such an event occurring is small. A plausible scenario is the accretion of a giant molecular cloud by a dormant black hole of $10^8 - 10^9$ solar masses. AT2021lwx thus represents an extreme extension of the known scenarios of black hole accretion. |

|**Abstract**| In this work, we studied the Galactic Center supermassive black hole (SMBH), Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), with the KVN and VERA Array (KaVA)/East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN) monitoring observations. Especially on 13 May 2019, Sgr A* experienced an unprecedented bright near infra-red (NIR) flare; so, we find a possible counterpart at 43 GHz (7 mm). As a result, a large temporal variation of the flux density at the level 15.4%, with the highest flux density of 2.04 Jy, is found on 11 May 2019. Interestingly, the intrinsic sizes are also variable, and the area and major-axis size show a marginal correlation with flux density with >2{\sigma}. Thus, we interpret that the emission region at 43 GHz follows the larger-when-brighter relation in 2019. The possible origins are discussed with an emergence of a weak jet/outflow component and the position angle change of the rotation axis of the accretion disk in time. |

|**Abstract**| A full understanding of how unusually large "Ultra Diffuse Galaxies" (UDGs) fit into our conventional theory of dwarf galaxy formation remains elusive, despite the large number of objects identified locally. A natural extension of UDG research is the study of similar galaxies at higher redshift to establish how their properties may evolve over time. However, this has been a challenging task given how severely cosmological surface brightness dimming inhibits our ability to detect low-surface brightness galaxies at high-$z$. Here, we present a sample of low stellar surface density galaxies (LDGs) at moderate redshift, likely the progenitors of local UDGs, identified in deep near-IR {\it JWST} observations of the El Gordo cluster at $z=0.87$. By stacking 8 NIRCAM filters, reach an apparent surface brightness sensitivity of 24.59~mag~arcsec$^{-2}$, faint enough to be complete to the bright end of the LDG population. Our analysis identifies significant differences between this population and UDGs observed locally, including differences in their color and size distributions, which suggest that the UDG progenitors at high-$z$ are bluer and more extended than UDGs at $z=0$. This suggests that multiple mechanisms are responsible for UDG formation and that prolonged transformation of cluster dwarfs is not a primary UDG formation mechanism at high-$z$. Furthermore, we find a slight overabundance of LDGs in El Gordo, and, in contrast to findings in local clusters, our analysis does not show a deficit of LDGs in the center of El Gordo, implying that tidal destruction of LDGs is significant between $z=0.87$ and $z=0$. |

|**Abstract**| We present the first statistical study of spatially integrated non-Gaussian stellar kinematics spanning 7 Gyr in cosmic time. We use deep, rest-frame optical spectroscopy of massive galaxies (stellar mass $M_\star > 10^{10.5} {\rm M}_\odot$) at redshifts z = 0.05, 0.3 and 0.8 from the SAMI, MAGPI and LEGA-C surveys, to measure the excess kurtosis $h_4$ of the stellar velocity distribution, the latter parametrised as a Gauss-Hermite series. We find that at all redshifts where we have large enough samples, $h_4$ anti-correlates with the ratio between rotation and dispersion, highlighting the physical connection between these two kinematic observables. In addition, and independently from the anti-correlation with rotation-to-dispersion ratio, we also find a correlation between $h_4$ and $M_\star$, potentially connected to the assembly history of galaxies. In contrast, after controlling for mass, we find no evidence of independent correlation between $h_4$ and aperture velocity dispersion or galaxy size. These results hold for both star-forming and quiescent galaxies. For quiescent galaxies, $h_4$ also correlates with projected shape, even after controlling for the rotation-to-dispersion ratio. At any given redshift, star-forming galaxies have lower $h_4$ compared to quiescent galaxies, highlighting the link between kinematic structure and star-forming activity. |
