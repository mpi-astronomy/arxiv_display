|**Abstract**| Of the hundreds of $z\gtrsim6$ quasars discovered to date, only one is known to be gravitationally lensed, despite the high lensing optical depth expected at $z\gtrsim6$. High-redshift quasars are typically identified in large-scale surveys by applying strict photometric selection criteria, in particular by imposing non-detections in bands blueward of the Lyman-$\alpha$ line. Such procedures by design prohibit the discovery of lensed quasars, as the lensing foreground galaxy would contaminate the photometry of the quasar. We present a novel quasar selection methodology, applying contrastive learning (an unsupervised machine learning technique) to Dark Energy Survey imaging data. We describe the use of this technique to train a neural network which isolates an 'island' of 11 sources, of which 7 are known $z\sim6$ quasars. Of the remaining four, three are newly discovered quasars (J0109-5424, $z=6.07$; J0122-4609, $z=5.99$; J0603-3923, $z=5.94$), as confirmed by follow-up Gemini-South/GMOS and archival NTT/EFOSC2 spectroscopy, implying a 91 per cent efficiency for our novel selection method; the final object on the island is a brown dwarf. In one case (J0109-5424), emission below the Lyman limit unambiguously indicates the presence of a foreground source, though high-resolution optical/near-infrared imaging is still needed to confirm the quasar's lensed (multiply-imaged) nature. Detection in the g band has led this quasar to escape selection by traditional colour cuts. Our findings demonstrate that machine learning techniques can thus play a key role in unveiling populations of quasars missed by traditional methods. |

|| <mark>S. Li</mark>, R. L. Beaton |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-03-27*|
|*Comments*| *20 pages, 3 figures, Invited chapter for the edited book "Hubble Constant Tension" (Eds. E. Di Valentino and D. Brout, Springer Singapore, expected in 2024)*|
|**Abstract**| While the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) has been used as a distance indicator since the early 1990's, its application to measure the Hubble Constant as a primary distance indicator occurred only recently. The TRGB is also currently at an interesting crossroads as results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are beginning to emerge. In this chapter, we provide a review of the TRGB as it is used to measure the Hubble constant. First, we provide an essential review of the physical and observational basis of the TRGB as well as providing a summary for its use for measuring the Hubble Constant. More attention is then given is then given to recent, but still pre-JWST, developments, including new calibrations and developments with algorithms. We also address challenges that arise while measuring a TRGB-based Hubble Constant. We close by looking forward to the exciting prospects from telescopes such as JWST and Gaia. |
