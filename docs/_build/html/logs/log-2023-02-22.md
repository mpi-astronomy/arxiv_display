|**Abstract**| The CARMENES instrument was conceived to deliver high-accuracy radial velocity (RV) measurements with long-term stability to search for temperate rocky planets around a sample of nearby cool stars. The broad wavelength coverage was designed to provide a range of stellar activity indicators to assess the nature of potential RV signals and to provide valuable spectral information to help characterise the stellar targets. The CARMENES Data Release 1 (DR1) makes public all observations obtained during the CARMENES guaranteed time observations, which ran from 2016 to 2020 and collected 19,633 spectra for a sample of 362 targets. The CARMENES survey target selection was aimed at minimising biases, and about 70% of all known M dwarfs within 10 pc and accessible from Calar Alto were included. The data were pipeline-processed, and high-level data products, including 18,642 precise RVs for 345 targets, were derived. Time series data of spectroscopic activity indicators were also obtained. We discuss the characteristics of the CARMENES data, the statistical properties of the stellar sample, and the spectroscopic measurements. We show examples of the use of CARMENES data and provide a contextual view of the exoplanet population revealed by the survey, including 33 new planets, 17 re-analysed planets, and 26 confirmed planets from transiting candidate follow-up. A subsample of 238 targets was used to derive updated planet occurrence rates, yielding an overall average of 1.44+/-0.20 planets with 1 M_Earth < M sin i < 1000 M_Earth and 1 d < P_orb < 1000 d per star, and indicating that nearly every M dwarf hosts at least one planet. CARMENES data have proven very useful for identifying and measuring planetary companions as well as for additional applications, such as the determination of stellar properties, the characterisation of stellar activity, and the study of exoplanet atmospheres. |

|**Abstract**| We report the discovery of two apparently isolated stellar remnants that exhibit rotationally modulated magnetic Balmer emission, adding to the emerging DAHe class of white dwarf stars. While the previously discovered members of this class show Zeeman-split triplet emission features corresponding to single magnetic field strengths, these two new objects exhibit significant fluctuations in their apparent magnetic field strengths with variability phase. The Zeeman-split hydrogen emission lines in LP $705{-}64$ broaden from $9.4$ MG to $22.2$ MG over an apparent spin period of $72.629$ minutes. Similarly, WD J$143019.29{-}562358.33$ varies from $5.8$ MG to $8.9$ MG over its apparent $86.394$-minute rotation period. This brings the DAHe class of white dwarfs to at least five objects, all with effective temperatures within $500$ K of $8000$ K and masses ranging from $0.65{-}0.83\,M_{\odot}$. |

|**Abstract**| We report the discovery of an extreme galaxy overdensity at $z = 5.4$ in the GOODS-S field using JWST/NIRCam imaging from JADES and JEMS alongside JWST/NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopy from FRESCO. We identified potential members of the overdensity using HST+JWST photometry spanning $\lambda = 0.4-5.0\ \mu\mathrm{m}$. These data provide accurate and well-constrained photometric redshifts down to $m \approx 29-30\,\mathrm{mag}$. We subsequently confirmed $N = 96$ potential members of the overdensity using JWST slitless spectroscopy over $\lambda = 3.9-5.0\ \mu\mathrm{m}$ through a targeted line search for $\mathrm{H} \alpha$ around the best-fit photometric redshift. We verified that $N = 53$ galaxies reside in the field at $z = 5.2-5.5$ while $N = 43$ galaxies reside in an overdensity at $z = 5.4$ around $\sim 10-12$ times that of a random volume. Stellar populations for these galaxies were inferred from the photometry and used to construct the star-forming main sequence, where protocluster members appeared more massive and exhibited earlier star formation (and thus older stellar populations) when compared to their field galaxy counterparts. We estimate the total halo mass of this large-scale structure to be $13.0 \lesssim \mathrm{log}_{10} \left( M_{\mathrm{halo}}/M_{\odot} \right) \lesssim 13.5$ using an empirical stellar mass to halo mass relation, although this is likely an underestimate as a result of incompleteness. Our discovery demonstrates the power of JWST at constraining dark matter halo assembly and galaxy formation at very early cosmic times. |

|**Abstract**| Directly imaging temperate rocky planets orbiting nearby, Sun-like stars with a 6-m-class IR/O/UV space telescope, recently dubbed the Habitable Worlds Observatory, is a high priority goal of the Astro2020 Decadal Survey. To prepare for future direct imaging surveys, the list of potential targets should be thoroughly vetted to maximize efficiency and scientific yield. We present an analysis of archival radial velocity data for southern stars from the NASA/NSF Extreme Precision Radial Velocity Working Group's list of high priority target stars for future direct imaging missions (drawn from the HabEx, LUVOIR, and Starshade studies). For each star, we constrain the region of companion mass and period parameter space we are already sensitive to based on the observational baseline, sampling, and precision of the archival RV data. Additionally, for some of the targets we report new estimates of magnetic activity cycle periods, rotation periods, improved orbital parameters for previously known exoplanets, and new candidate planet signals that require further vetting or observations to confirm. Our results show that for many of these stars we are not yet sensitive to even Saturn-mass planets in the habitable zone, let alone smaller planets, highlighting the need for future EPRV vetting efforts before the launch of a direct imaging mission. We present evidence that the candidate temperate super-Earth exoplanet HD 85512 b is most likely due to the star's rotation, and report an RV acceleration for delta Pav which supports the existence of a distant giant planet previously inferred from astrometry. |

|**Abstract**| Magnetars, neutron stars thought to be with ultra-strong magnetic fields of $10^{14 - 15}$ G, are observed to be much hotter than ordinary pulsars with $\sim 10^{12}$ G, and additional heating sources are required. One possibility is heating by the ambipolar diffusion in the stellar core. This scenario is examined by calculating the models using the relativistic thermal evolutionary code without making the isothermal approximation. The results show that this scenario can be consistent with most of the observed magnetar temperature data. |

|| <mark>Chengyuan Li</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-02-22*|

|**Abstract**| Helium variations are common features of globular clusters (GCs) with multiple stellar populations. All the formation scenarios predict that secondary population stars are enhanced in helium but the exact helium content depends on the polluters. Therefore, searching for helium variations in a star cluster is a straightforward method to understand if it hosts multiple populations or not, and constrain the formation scenario. Although this topic has been well explored for Galactic GCs, GCs beyond the Milky Way are challenging to study because of their large distances. This work studies the helium distribution of GK-type main sequence dwarfs in an old ($\sim$12.5 Gyr) GC in the Large Magellanic Cloud, NGC 2210, using the deep photometry observed by the {\sl Hubble Space Telescope}. We compare the observed morphology of the MS with that of synthetic populations with different helium distributions. We confirm that NGC 2210 dwarfs have a helium spread, with an internal dispersion of $\delta{Y}\sim$0.06--0.07. The fraction of helium enriched stars depends on the $\delta{Y}$ distribution. A continuous $\delta{Y}$ distribution would indicate that more than half of MS stars are helium enriched ($\sim$55\%). If the $\delta{Y}$ distribution is discrete (bimodal), a fraction of $\sim$30\% enriched stars is able to explain the observed morphology of the MS. We also find that the He-enriched population stars are more centrally concentrated than He-normal stars. |

|**Abstract**| Quasi-periodic Oscillations (QPOs) from magnetars bursts are rare, some high-confidence detections are mostly from magnetar Gaint Flares. Following a systematically research of bursts data from Fermi/GBM, here we report a 4.98$\sigma$ ($p$-value is 6.51e-7) detection of high frequency QPO $\sim$ 80 Hz in SGR 150228213. This burst has initially attributed to 4U 0142+61 by Fermi/GBM, however, it shows a different spectral features with other magnetar bursts, including burts from 4U 0142+61. More interestingly, we find the location of SGR 150228213 almost coincides with the periodic Fast Radio Burst source FRB 180916. Finally, we discuss the possible physical origins of this burst. |

|**Abstract**| The European Space Agency's Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko has offered scientists the opportunity to study a comet in unprecedented detail. Four instruments of the Rosetta orbiter, namely, the Micro-Imaging Dust Analysis System (MIDAS), the Grain Impact Analyzer and Dust Accumulator (GIADA), the COmetary Secondary Ion Mass Analyser (COSIMA), and the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) have provided information on cometary dust particles. Cross-instrument comparisons are crucial to characterize cometary dust particles beyond the capabilities of individual sensors, as they are sensitive to different dust components. We present the first comparison between detections of the ROSINA COmet Pressure Sensor (COPS) and GIADA. These two instruments are complementary as the former is sensitive solely to volatiles of icy particles, while the latter measured the dust particle as a whole, including refractories and condensed (semi)volatiles. Our goal is to correlate the particles detected by COPS and GIADA and to assess whether they belong to a common group. We statistically analyzed the in situ data of COPS and GIADA by calculating Pearson correlation coefficients. Among the several types of particles detected by GIADA, we find that COPS particles are significantly correlated solely with GIADA fluffy agglomerates (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.55 and p-value of $4.6\cdot 10^{-3}$). This suggests that fluffy particles are composed of both refractories and volatiles. COPS volatile volumes, which may be represented by equivalent spheres with a diameter in the range between 0.06 $\mu$m and 0.8 $\mu$m, are similar to the sizes of the fractal particle's subunits identified by MIDAS (i.e., 0.05-0.18 $\mu$m). |

|**Abstract**| We report the first measurement of polarized thermal dust emission toward the entire early and massive Infrared Dark Cloud G11.11$-$0.12 taken by the polarimeter SOFIA/HAWC+ at 214 $\mu m$ wavelength. Magnetic fields (B-fields) obtained from the polarized emission tend to be perpendicular to the filament's spine. We produce a map of B-field strengths for the center region of the filament. The strengths vary in the range of 100-600 $\mu\rm{G}$ and are strongest along the filament's spine. The central region is sub-Alfv\'enic and mostly sub-critical meaning that B-fields dominate over turbulence and are strong enough to resist gravitational collapse. The alignment and properties of dust grains are studied in the filament using the RAdiative Torque (RAT) theory. We find the decrease of polarization degree $P$ with emission intensity $I$, i.e., depolarization effect, of the form $P\propto I^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha\sim$0.8-0.9, implying a significant loss of grain alignment in the filament's spine. The depolarization can be explained by the decrease in RAT alignment efficiency toward the denser regions with lower dust temperature, and cannot be explained by the B-field tangling. We study the effect of the enhanced magnetic relaxation by embedded iron inclusions on RAT alignment and find that the high polarization fraction $P\sim$20-30\% in the outer layer of the filament is potential evidence for the enhanced RAT alignment by magnetic relaxation. This is the first time this effect is evaluated in a filament. Based on the polarization fraction and RAT alignment theory, we find evidence for grain growth in the filament. |

|**Abstract**| Evidence for the presence of ion cyclotron waves, driven by turbulence, at the boundaries of the current sheet is reported in this paper. By exploiting the full potential of the joint observations performed by Parker Solar Probe and the Metis coronagraph on board Solar Orbiter, local measurements of the solar wind can be linked with the large-scale structures of the solar corona. The results suggest that the dynamics of the current sheet layers generates turbulence, which in turn creates a sufficiently strong temperature anisotropy to make the solar-wind plasma unstable to anisotropy-driven instabilities such as the Alfv\'en ion-cyclotron, mirror-mode, and firehose instabilities. The study of the polarization state of high-frequency magnetic fluctuations reveals that ion cyclotron waves are indeed present along the current sheet, thus linking the magnetic topology of the remotely imaged coronal source regions with the wave bursts observed in situ. The present results may allow improvement of state-of-the-art models based on the ion cyclotron mechanism, providing new insights into the processes involved in coronal heating. |

|**Abstract**| We investigate the fraction of baryon mass in intergalactic medium ($f_\mathrm{IGM}$), using 18 well-localized FRBs in the redshift range $z\in (0.0039,0.66)$. We construct a five-parameter Bayesian inference model, with the probability distributions of dispersion measures (DM) of IGM and host galaxy properly taken into account. To check the possible redshift evolution, we parameterize $f_\mathrm{IGM}$ as a mildly evolving function of redshift, $f_\mathrm{IGM}=f_\mathrm{IGM,0}[1+\alpha z/(1+z)]$. By simultaneously constraining five parameters, we get $f_\mathrm{IGM,0} = 0.92^{+0.06}_{-0.12}$ and $\alpha = 0.49^{+0.59}_{-0.47}$, and the median value of DM of host galaxy is $\exp(\mu)=72.49^{+33.31}_{-25.62}~{\rm pc ~ cm ^ {-3}}$. By fixing two parameters which can be constrained independently with other observations, we obtain $\alpha =0.11^{+0.24}_{-0.27}$ in the three-parameter fit, which is consistent with zero within $1\sigma$ uncertainty. Monte Carlo simulations show that even 300 FRBs are not enough to tightly constrain five parameters simultaneously. This is mainly caused by the correlation between parameters. Only if two parameters are fixed, 100 FRBs are necessary to achieve unbiased constraints on the remaining parameters. |

|**Abstract**| Recently, it has been proposed that the magnetic-field-induced transition (MIT) in Fe X can be used to measure coronal magnetic field strengths. Several techniques, the direct line ratio technique and the weak and strong magnetic field techniques, are developed to apply the MIT theory to spectroscopic observations taken by EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard Hinode. However, the suitability of coronal magnetic field measurements based on the weak and strong magnetic field techniques has not been evaluated. Besides, temperature diagnostics is also important for measuring coronal magnetic field based on the MIT theory, but how to determine the accurate formation temperature of the Fe X lines from EIS observations still needs investigation. In this study, we synthesized emissions of several spectral lines from a 3D radiation magnetohydrodynamic model of a solar active region, and then derived magnetic field strengths using different methods. We first compared the magnetic field strengths derived from the weak and strong magnetic field techniques to the values in the model. Our study suggests that both weak and strong magnetic field techniques underestimate the coronal magnetic field strength. Then we developed two methods to calculate the formation temperature of the Fe X lines. One is based on differential emission measure analyses, and the other is deriving temperature from the Fe IX and Fe XI line pairs. However, neither of the two methods can provide temperature determination for accurate coronal magnetic field measurements as those derived from the Fe X 174/175 and 184/345 {\AA} line ratios. More efforts are still needed for accurate coronal magnetic field measurements using EIS observations. |

|**Abstract**| Dark sirens, i.e., gravitational-wave (GW) sources without electromagnetic counterparts, are new probes of the expansion of the universe. The efficacy of this method relies on correctly localizing the host galaxies. However, recent theoretical studies have shown that astrophysical environments could mislead the spatial localization by distorting the GW signals. It is unclear whether and to what degree the incorrect spatial localizations of dark sirens would impair the accuracy of the measurement of the cosmological parameters. To address this issue, we consider the future observations of dark sirens using the Cosmic Explore and the Einstein Telescope, and we design a Bayesian framework to access the precision of measuring the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant $H_0$. Interestingly, we find that the precision is not compromised when the number of well-localized dark sirens is significantly below $300$, even in the extreme scenario that all the dark sirens are localized incorrectly. As the number exceeds $300$, the incorrect spatial localizations start to produce statistically noticeable effects, such as a slow convergence of the posterior distribution of $H_0$. We propose several tests that can be used in future observations to verify the spatial localizations of dark sirens. Simulations of these tests suggest that incorrect spatial localizations will dominate a systematic error of $H_0$ if as much as $10\%$ of a sample of $300$ well-localized dark sirens are affected by their environments. Our results have important implications for the long-term goal of measuring $H_0$ to a precision of $<1\%$ using dark sirens. |

|**Abstract**| TOI-1055 is a Sun-like star known to host a transiting Neptune-sized planet on a 17.5-day orbit (TOI-1055 b). Radial velocity (RV) analyses carried out by two independent groups using almost the same set of HARPS spectra provide planetary masses that differ by $\sim$2$\sigma$. Our aim was to solve the inconsistency in the published planetary masses by significantly extending the set of HARPS RV measurements and employing a new analysis tool able to account and correct for stellar activity. Our further aim was to improve the precision on the planetary radius by observing two transits of the planet with the CHEOPS space telescope. We fitted a skew normal function to each cross correlation function extracted from the HARPS spectra to obtain RV measurements and hyperparameters to be used for the detrending. We evaluated the correlation changes of the hyperparameters along the RV time series using the breakpoint technique, further performing a joint photometric and RV analysis using a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme simultaneously detrending the light curves and the RV time series. We firmly detected the Keplerian signal of TOI-1055 b, deriving a planetary mass of $M_b=20.4_{-2.5}^{+2.6}\,M_{\oplus}$ ($\sim$12%). This value agrees with one of the two estimates in the literature, but it is significantly more precise. Thanks to TESS transit light curve combined with the exquisite CHEOPS photometry, we also derived a planetary radius of $R_b=3.490_{-0.064}^{+0.070}\,R_{\oplus}$ ($\sim$1.9%). Our mass and radius measurements imply a mean density of $\rho_b=2.65_{-0.35}^{+0.37}$ g cm$^{-3}$ ($\sim$14%). We further inferred the planetary structure and found that TOI-1055 b very likely hosts a substantial gas envelope with a mass of $0.41^{+0.34}_{-0.20}$ M$_\oplus$ and a thickness of $1.05^{+0.30}_{-0.29}$ R$_\oplus$. |

|**Abstract**| Purpose: The Low-Energy X-ray telescope (LE) is a main instrument of the Insight-HXMT mission and consists of 96 Swept Charge Devices (SCD) covering the 1-10 keV energy band. The energy gain and resolution are continuously calibrated by analysing Cassiopeia A (Cas A) and blank sky data, while the effective areas are also calibrated with the observations of the Crab Nebula. In this paper, we present the evolution of the in-orbit performances of LE in the first 5 years since launch. Methods: The Insight-HXMT Data Analysis Software package (HXMTDAS) is utilized to extract the spectra of Cas A, blank sky, and Crab Nebula using different Good Time Interval (GTI) selections. We fit a model with a power-law continuum and several Gaussian lines to different ranges of Cas A and blank sky spectra to get peak energies of their lines through xspec. After updating the energy gain calibration in CALibration DataBase (CALDB), we rerun the Cas A data to obtain the energy resolution. An empirical function is used to modify the simulated effective areas so that the background-subtracted spectrum of the Crab Nebula can best match the standard model of the Crab Nebula. Results: The energy gain, resolution, and effective areas are calibrated every month. The corresponding calibration results are duly updated in CALDB, which can be downloaded and used for the analysis of Insight-HXMT data. Simultaneous observations with NuSTAR and NICER can also be used to verify our derived results. Conclusion: LE is a well calibrated X-ray telescope working in 1-10 keV band. The uncertainty of LE gain is less than 20 eV in 2-9 keV band and the uncertainty of LE resolution is less than 15eV. The systematic errors of LE, compared to the model of the Crab Nebula, are lower than 1.5% in 1-10 keV. |

|**Abstract**| Ba-enhanced stars are interesting probes of stellar astrophysics and Galactic formation history. In this work, we investigate the chemistry and kinematics for a large sample of Ba-enhanced ([Ba/Fe]$>$1.0) dwarf and subgiant stars with $5000 < T_{\rm eff }< 6700$\,K from LAMOST. We find that both stellar internal evolution process and external mass exchange due to binary evolution are responsible for the origins of the Ba-enhancement of our sample stars. About one third of them exhibit C and N enhancement and ultraviolet brightness excess, indicating they are products of binary evolution. The remaining Ba-enhanced stars with normal C and N abundances are mostly warm stars with $T_{\rm eff} > 6000$\,K. They are likely consequences of stellar internal elemental transport processes, but they show very different elemental patterns to the hotter Am/Fm stars. Our results reveal a substantially lack of high-[$\alpha$/Fe] Ba-enhanced stars in the [Fe/H]--[$\alpha$/Fe] plane, which we dub as a {\em high-$\alpha$ desert}. We suggest it is due to a lower efficiency for producing Ba-enhanced stars by low-mass AGB progenitors in binary systems. Our results call for detailed modellings for these Ba-enhanced stellar peculiars, in the context of both stellar internal elemental transport and external mass accretion. |

|**Abstract**| The Chang'E 5 (CE-5) samples represent the youngest mare basalt ever known and provide an access into the late lunar evolution. Recent studies have revealed that CE-5 basalts are the most evolved lunar basalt, yet controversy remains over the nature of their mantle sources. Here we combine Fe and Mg isotope analyses with a comprehensive study of petrology and mineralogy on two CE-5 basalt clasts. These two clasts have a very low Mg# (~29) and show similar Mg isotope compositions with Apollo low-Ti mare basalts as well as intermediate TiO2 and Fe isotope compositions between low-Ti and high-Ti mare basalts. Fractional crystallization or evaporation during impact cannot produce such geochemical signatures which otherwise indicate a hybrid mantle source that incorporates both early- and late-stage lunar magma ocean (LMO) cumulates. Such a hybrid mantle source would be also compatible with the KREEP-like REE pattern of CE-5 basalts. Overall, our new Fe-Mg isotope data highlight the role of late LMO cumulate for the generation of young lunar volcanism. |

|**Abstract**| We report the discovery of a super-Jovian 2:1 mean-motion resonance (MMR) pair around the G-type star TIC 279401253, whose dynamical architecture is a prospective benchmark for planet formation and orbital evolution analysis. The system was discovered thanks to a single transit event recorded by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission, which pointed to a Jupiter-sized companion with poorly constrained orbital parameters. We began ground-based precise radial velocity (RV) monitoring with HARPS and FEROS within the Warm gIaNts with tEss (WINE) survey to constrain the transiting body's period, mass, and eccentricity. The RV measurements revealed not one but two massive planets with periods of 76.80$_{-0.06}^{+0.06}$ days and 155.3$_{-0.7}^{+0.7}$ days, respectively. A combined analysis of transit and RV data yields an inner transiting planet with a mass of 6.14$_{-0.42}^{+0.39}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$ and a radius of 1.00$_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$ R$_{\rm Jup}$, and an outer planet with a minimum mass of 8.02$_{-0.18}^{+0.18}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$, indicating a massive giant pair. A detailed dynamical analysis of the system reveals that the planets are locked in a strong first-order, eccentricity-type 2:1 MMR, which makes TIC 279401253 one of the rare examples of truly resonant architectures supporting disk-induced planet migration. The bright host star, $V \approx$ 11.9 mag, the relatively short orbital period ($P_{\rm b}$ = 76.80$_{-0.06}^{+0.06}$ d) and pronounced eccentricity (e =0.448$_{-0.029}^{+0.028}$) make the transiting planet a valuable target for atmospheric investigation with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and ground-based extremely-large telescopes. |
