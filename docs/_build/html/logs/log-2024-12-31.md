|**Abstract**|            Context: The C-19 stellar stream is the most metal-poor stream known to date. While its width and velocity dispersion indicate a dwarf galaxy origin, its metallicity spread and abundance patterns are more similar to those of globular clusters (GCs). If it is indeed of GC origin, its extremely low metallicity ([Fe/H]=-3.4, estimated from giant stars) implies that these stellar systems can form out of gas that is as extremely poor in metals as this. Previously, only giant stream stars were observed spectroscopically, although the majority of stream stars are unevolved stars. Aims: We pushed the spectroscopic observations to the subgiant branch stars ($G\approx 20$) in order to consolidate the chemical and dynamical properties of C-19. Methods: We used the high-efficiency spectrograph X-shooter fed by the ESO 8.2 m VLT telescope to observe 15 candidate subgiant C-19 members. The spectra were used to measure radial velocities and to determine chemical abundances using the \mygi\ code. Results; We developed a likelihood model that takes metallicity and radial velocities into account. We conclude that 12 stars are likely members of C-19, while 3 stars (S05, S12, and S13) are likely contaminants. When these 3 stars are excluded, our model implies a mean metallicity $\rm \langle [Fe/H]\rangle = -3.1\pm 0.1$, the mean radial velocity is $\langle v_r\rangle = -192\pm3$ kms$^{-1}$, and the velocity dispersion is $\sigma_{vr} = 5.9^{+3.6}_{-5.9}$ kms$^{-1}$. This all agrees within errors with previous studies. The A(Mg) of a sample of 15 C-19 members, including 6 giant stars, shows a standard deviation of 0.44 dex, and the mean uncertainty on Mg is 0.25 dex. Conclusions: Our preferred interpretation of the current data is that C-19 is a disrupted GC. We cannot completely rule out the possibility that the GC could have belonged to a dwarf galaxy that contained more metal-rich stars, however. This scenario would explain the radial velocity members at higher metallicity, as well as the width and velocity dispersion of the stream. In either case, a GC formed out of gas as poor in metals as these stars seems necessary to explain the existence of C-19. The possibility that no GC was associated with C-19 cannot be ruled out either.         |

|**Abstract**|            Nanoflares are believed to be key contributors to heating solar non-flaring active regions, though their individual detection remains challenging. This study uses a data-driven field-aligned hydrodynamic model to examine nanoflare properties throughout the lifecycle of AR12758. We simulate coronal loop emissions, where each loop is heated by random nanoflares depending on the loop parameters derived from photospheric magnetograms observed by SDO/HMI. Simulated X-ray flux and temperature can reproduce the temporal variations observed by Chandrayaan-2/XSM. Our findings show that high-frequency nanoflares contribute to cool emissions across the AR, while low- and intermediate- frequency primarily contribute to hot emissions. During the emerging phase, energy deposition is dominated by low-frequency events. Post-emergence, energy is deposited by both low- and intermediate-frequency nanoflares, while as the AR ages, the contribution from intermediate- and high-frequency nanoflares increases. The spatial distribution of heating frequencies across the AR reveals a clear pattern: the core of the active region spends most of its time in a low-frequency heating state, the periphery is dominated by high-frequency heating, and the region between the core and periphery experiences intermediate-frequency heating.         |

|**Abstract**|            In this paper, we detail recent and current work that is being carried out to fabricate and advance novel SiC UV instrumentation that is aimed at enabling more sensitive measurements across numerous disciplines, with a short discussion of the promise such detectors may hold for the Habitable Worlds Observatory. We discuss SiC instrument development progress that is being carried out under multiple NASA grants, including several PICASSO and SBIR grants, as well as an ECI grant. Testing of pixel design, properties and layout as well as maturation of the integration scheme developed through these efforts provide key technology and engineering advancement for potential HWO detectors. Achieving desired noise characteristics, responsivity, and validating operation of SiC detectors using standard read out techniques offers a compelling platform for operation of denser and higher dimensionality SiC photodiode arrays of interest for use in potential HWO Coronagraph, Spectrograph, and High Resolution Imaging Instruments. We incorporate these SiC detector properties into a simulation of potential NUV exoplanet observations by HWO using SiC detectors and also discuss potential application to HWO.         |
