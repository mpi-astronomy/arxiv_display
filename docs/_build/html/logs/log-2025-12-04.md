|**Abstract**|            We present a comprehensive study of mid-infrared neutral hydrogen (H~\textsc{i}) emission lines in 79 nearby (d $<$ 200 $pc$) young stars using JWST/MIRI. We aim to identify mid-infrared H~\textsc{i} transitions that can serve as reliable accretion diagnostics in young stars, and evaluate their utility in deriving physical conditions of the accreting gas. We identify and measure 22 H~\textsc{i} transitions in the MIRI wavelength regime (5-28 $\mu m$) and perform LTE slab modelling to remove the H\textsubscript{2}O contribution from selected H~\textsc{i} transitions. We find that mid-IR H~\textsc{i} line emission is spatially compact, even for sources with spatially extended [Ne~\textsc{ii}] and [Fe~\textsc{ii}] jets, suggesting minimal contamination from extended jet. Although Pfund~$\alpha$ (H~\textsc{i}~6--5) and Humphreys~$\alpha$ (H~\textsc{i}~7--6) are the strongest lines, they are blended with H$_2$O transitions. This blending necessitates additional processing to remove molecular contamination, thereby limiting their use as accretion diagnostics. Instead, we identify the H~\textsc{i}~(8--6) at 7.502 $\mu m$ and H~\textsc{i}~(10--7) at 8.760 $\mu m$ transitions as better alternatives, as they are largely unaffected by molecular contamination and offer a more reliable means of measuring accretion rates from MIRI spectra. We provide updated empirical relations for converting mid-IR H~\textsc{i} line luminosities into accretion luminosity for 6 different H~\textsc{i} lines in the MIRI wavelength range. Moreover, comparison of observed line ratios with theoretical models shows that MIR H~\textsc{i} lines offer robust constraints on the hydrogen gas density in accretion columns, $n_\mathrm{H} = $10$^{10.6}$ to 10$^{11.2}$ cm$^{-3}$ in most stars, with some stars exhibiting lower densities ($<10^{10}$~cm$^{-3}$), approaching the optically thin regime.         |

|**Abstract**|            Nuclear star clusters (NSC) are dense and compact stellar systems, of sizes of few parsecs, located at galactic centers. Their properties and formation mechanisms seem to be tightly linked to the evolution of the host galaxy, with potentially different formation channels for late- and early-type galaxies (respectively, LTGs and ETGs). While most observations target ETGs, here we focus on the NSC in M 74 (NGC 628), a relatively massive, gas-rich and star-forming spiral galaxy, part of the PHANGS survey. We analyzed the central arcmin of the PHANGS-MUSE mosaic, in which the NSC is not spatially resolved. We performed a two-dimensional spectro-photometric decomposition of the MUSE cube, employing a modified version of the C2D code, to disentangle the NSC from the host galaxy. Here we used three components: a bulge, a disk and a NSC approximated to the point spread function (PSF), obtaining three data cubes, one for each component. This allowed us to extract separately the age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] abundance for the NSC and the host galaxy. Our results show a very old and metal-poor NSC, in contrast to the surrounding regions. While similar properties were found in NSCs hosted by galaxies of different masses and/or morphological types from M 74, they are somewhat unexpected for a relatively massive star-forming spiral galaxy. The spatially resolved stellar populations of the host galaxy display much younger (light-weighted) ages and higher metallicities, especially in the central region (${\sim}500$ pc) surrounding the NSC. This suggests that this NSC formed a long time ago, and evolved passively until today, without any further growth. Our results show that the NSC was not involved in the active recent star-formation history of its host galaxy.         |

|**Abstract**|            Quasars at the dawn of Cosmic Time ($z>6$) are fundamental probes to investigate the early co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxy. Nevertheless, their infrared spectral energy distribution remains at the present time poorly constrained, due to the limited photometric coverage probing the far-infrared wavelength range where the dust modified black-body is expected to peak ($\sim80$ $\mathrm{\mu m}$). Here we present a study of the high-frequency dust emission via a dedicated ALMA Band 8 ($\sim$400 GHz) campaign targeting 11 quasar host galaxies at $6<z<7$. Combined with archival observations in other ALMA bands, this program enables a detailed characterization of their infrared emission, allowing for the derivation of dust masses ($M_{d}$), dust emissivity indexes ($\beta$), dust temperatures ($T_{d}$), infrared luminosities ($L_{IR}$), and associated star formation rates (SFRs). Our analysis confirms that dust temperature is on average higher in this sample (34-65 K) if compared to local main-sequence galaxies' values, and that this finding can be linked to the increased star formation efficiency we derive in our work, as also suggested by the [CII]$_{158\mu m}$ deficit. Most remarkably, we note that the average value of $T_d$ of this sample doesn't differ from the one that is observed in luminous, ultra-luminous and hyper-luminous infrared galaxies at different redshifts that show no signs of hosting a quasar. Finally, our findings suggest that the presence of a bright AGN does not significantly bias the derived infrared properties, although further high-frequency, high-spatial resolution observations might reveal more subtle impacts on sub-kiloparsec scales.         |

|**Abstract**|            Astrophysical searches for dark matter in the Milky Way require a reliable model for its density distribution, which in turn depends on the influence of baryonic feedback on the Galaxy. In this work, we utilize a new suite of Milky Way-mass halos from the DREAMS Project, simulated with Cold Dark Matter (CDM),to quantify the influence of baryon feedback and intrinsic halo-to-halo variance on dark matter density profiles. Our suite of 1024 halos varies over supernova and black hole feedback parameters from the IllustrisTNG model, as well as variations in two cosmological parameters. We find that Milky Way-mass dark matter density profiles in the IllustrisTNG model are largely insensitive to astrophysics and cosmology variations, with the dominant source of scatter instead arising from halo-to-halo variance. However, most of the (comparatively minor) feedback-driven variations come from the changes to supernova prescriptions. By comparing to dark matter-only simulations, we find that the strongest supernova wind energies are so effective at preventing galaxy formation that the halos are nearly entirely collisionless dark matter. Finally, regardless of physics variation, all the DREAMS halos are roughly consistent with a halo contracting adiabatically from the presence of baryons, unlike models that have bursty stellar feedback. This work represents a step toward assessing the robustness of Milky Way dark matter profiles, with direct implications for dark matter searches where systematic uncertainty in the density profile remains a major challenge.         |

|| X. Jin, et al. -- incl., <mark>Y. Wu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-12-04*|

|**Abstract**|            We present new Chandra observations of seven luminous quasars at $z>6.5$. Combined with archival Chandra observations of all other known quasars, they form nearly complete X-ray observations of all currently known $z\sim7$ quasars with $M_{1450}<-26.5$, except for J0313$-$1806 at $z=7.642$ and J0910$-$0414 at $z=6.636$. Together with existing ground-based NIR spectroscopy and ALMA observations, we investigate the correlations between X-ray emission (the X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ and the optical/UV-to-X-ray spectral slope $\alpha_{\rm OX}$) and various quasar properties (rest-UV luminosity $L_{\mathrm{2500\ \mathring{A}}}$, bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm bol}$, C IV blueshift, and infrared luminosity $L_{\rm IR}$). We find most $z>6.5$ quasars follow a similar $\alpha_{\rm OX}-L_{\mathrm{2500\ \mathring{A}}}$ relation as $z\sim1-6$ quasars, but also display a large scatter. We find a potential correlation between $\alpha_{\rm OX}$ and the C IV blueshift, suggesting a soft optical/UV-to-X-ray SED shape is frequently associated with fast disk winds. Furthermore, we analyze the X-ray spectrum of 11 quasars at $z>6.5$ with Chandra detection, and find the best-fit photon index $\Gamma$ is $2.41\pm0.27$, which is likely driven by high accretion rates of $z>6.5$ quasars. In addition, we find there are no significant correlations between either $L_{\rm X}$ and $L_{\rm IR}$, nor $L_{\rm bol}$ and $L_{\rm IR}$, suggesting no strong correlations between quasar luminosity and star formation luminosity for the most luminous quasars at $z>6.5$.         |

|| P. A. Collaboration, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-12-04*|
|*Comments*| *20 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables*|
|**Abstract**|            The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) measures radio emission from high-energy extensive air showers. Consisting of 153 autonomous radio-detector stations spread over $17$\,km$^2$, it detects radio waves in the frequency range of $30$ to $80$\,MHz. Accurate characterization of the detector response is crucial for proper interpretation of the collected data. Previously, this was achieved through laboratory measurements of the analog chain and simulations and measurements of the antenna's directional response. In this paper, we perform an absolute calibration using the continuously monitored sidereal modulation of the diffuse Galactic radio emission. Calibration is done by comparing the average frequency spectra recorded by the stations with predictions from seven different models of the full radio sky, accounting for the system response, which includes the antenna, filters, and amplifiers. The analysis of the calibration constants over a period of seven years shows no relevant and no significant ageing effect in the AERA antennas. This result confirms the long-term stability of the detector stations and demonstrates the possibility for a radio detector to effectively monitor ageing effects of other detectors operating over extended periods.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2025-12-04*|
|*Comments*| *10 pages, 5 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            This work investigates whether large language models (LLMs) offer advantages over traditional neural networks for astronomical data processing, in regimes with non-Gaussian, non-stationary noise and limited labeled samples. Gravitational wave observations provide an suitable test case, using only 90 LIGO events, finetuned LLMs achieve 97.4\% accuracy for identifying signals. Further experiments show that, in contrast to traditional networks that rely on large simulated datasets, additional simulated samples do not improve LLM performance, while scaling studies reveal predictable gains with increasing model size and dataset size. These results indicate that LLMs can extract discriminative structure directly from observational data and provide an efficient assessment for gravitational wave identification. The same strategy may extend to other astronomical domains with similar noise properties, such as radio or pulsar observations.         |

|**Abstract**|            The correlation between galaxy stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity, known as the mass-metallicity relation (MZR), gives key insights into the processes that govern galaxy evolution. However, unquantified observational and selection biases can result in systematic errors in attempts to recover the intrinsic MZR, particularly at higher redshifts. We characterize the MZR at z~3-6 within a fully Bayesian framework using JWST NIRSpec spectra of 193 galaxies from the RUBIES survey. We forward model the observed mass-metallicity surface using prospector-generated spectra to account for two selection biases: the survey selection function and success in observing high signal-to-noise emission lines. We demonstrate that the RUBIES selection function, based on F444W magnitude and F150W-F444W color, has a negligible effect on our measured MZR. A correct treatment of the non-Gaussian metallicity uncertainties from strong-line calibrations lowers the derived MZR normalization by 0.2 dex and flattens the slope by ~20%; forward-modeling the effect of emission line observability steepens the slope by ~15%. Both of these biases must be taken into account in order to properly measure the intrinsic MZR. This novel forward modeling process motivates careful consideration of selection functions in future surveys, and paves the way for robust, high-redshift chemical enrichment studies that trace the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation across cosmic time.         |

|**Abstract**|            This study aims to characterize debris disks observed with SPHERE across multiple programs, with the goal of identifying systematic trends in disk morphology, dust mass, and grain properties as a function of stellar parameters. We analyzed a sample of 161 young stars using SPHERE observations at optical and near-IR wavelengths. Disk geometries were derived from ellipse fitting and model grids, while dust mass and properties were constrained by modified blackbody (MBB) and size distribution (SD) modeling of SEDs. The dynamical modeling was performed to assess whether the observed disk structures can be explained by the presence of unseen planets. We resolved 51 debris disks, including four new detections: HD 36968, BD-20 951, and the inner belts of HR 8799 and HD 36546. In addition, we found a second transiting giant planet in the HD 114082 system, with a radius of 1.29 $R_{\rm Jup}$ and an orbital distance of ~1 au. We identified nine multi-belt systems, with outer-to-inner belt radius ratios of $1.5-2$, and found close agreement between scattered-light and millimeter-continuum belt radii. They scale weakly with stellar luminosity ($R_{\rm belt} \propto L_{\star}^{0.11}$), but show steeper dependencies when separated by CO and CO$_2$ freeze-out regimes. Disk fractional luminosities follow collisional decay trends, declining as $t_{\rm age}^{-1.18}$ for A and $t_{\rm age}^{-0.81}$ for F stars. The inferred dust masses span $10^{-5}-1\,M_\oplus$ from MBB and $0.01-1\,M_\oplus$ from SD modeling. These masses scale as $R_{\rm belt}^n$ with $n>2$ in belt radius and super-linearly with stellar mass, consistent with trends seen in protoplanetary disks. Analysing correlation between disk polarized flux and IR excess, we found an offset of ~1 dex between total-intensity (HST) and polarized fluxes. A new parametric approach to estimate dust albedo and maximum polarization fraction is introduced.         |
