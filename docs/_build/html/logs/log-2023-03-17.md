|**Abstract**| VISIONS is an ESO public survey of five nearby (d < 500 pc) star-forming molecular cloud complexes that are canonically associated with the constellations of Chamaeleon, Corona Australis, Lupus, Ophiuchus, and Orion. The survey was carried out with VISTA, using VIRCAM, and collected data in the near-infrared passbands J, H, and Ks. With a total on-sky exposure time of 49.4 h VISIONS covers an area of 650 deg$^2$, and it was designed to build an infrared legacy archive similar to that of 2MASS. Taking place between April 2017 and March 2022, the observations yielded approximately 1.15 million images, which comprise 19 TB of raw data. The observations are grouped into three different subsurveys: The wide subsurvey comprises shallow, large-scale observations and has visited the star-forming complexes six times over the course of its execution. The deep subsurvey of dedicated high-sensitivity observations has collected data on the areas with the largest amounts of dust extinction. The control subsurvey includes observations of areas of low-to-negligible dust extinction. Using this strategy, the VISIONS survey offers multi-epoch position measurements, is able to access deeply embedded objects, and provides a baseline for statistical comparisons and sample completeness. In particular, VISIONS is designed to measure the proper motions of point sources with a precision of 1 mas/yr or better, when complemented with data from VHS. Hence, VISIONS can provide proper motions for sources inaccessible to Gaia. VISIONS will enable addressing a range of topics, including the 3D distribution and motion of embedded stars and the nearby interstellar medium, the identification and characterization of young stellar objects, the formation and evolution of embedded stellar clusters and their initial mass function, as well as the characteristics of interstellar dust and the reddening law. |

|**Abstract**| The VISIONS public survey provides large-scale, multiepoch imaging of five nearby star-forming regions at subarcsecond resolution in the near-infrared. All data collected within the program and provided by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) science archive are processed with a custom end-to-end pipeline infrastructure to provide science-ready images and source catalogs. The data reduction environment has been specifically developed for the purpose of mitigating several shortcomings of the bona fide data products processed with software provided by the Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit (CASU), such as spatially variable astrometric and photometric biases of up to 100 mas and 0.1 mag, respectively. At the same time, the resolution of coadded images is up to 20% higher compared to the same products from the CASU processing environment. Most pipeline modules are written in Python and make extensive use of C extension libraries for numeric computations, thereby simultaneously providing accessibility, robustness, and high performance. The astrometric calibration is performed relative to the Gaia reference frame, and fluxes are calibrated with respect to the source magnitudes provided in the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). For bright sources, absolute astrometric errors are typically on the order of 10 to 15 mas and fluxes are determined with subpercent precision. Moreover, the calibration with respect to 2MASS photometry is largely free of color terms. The pipeline produces data that are compliant with the ESO Phase 3 regulations and furthermore provides curated source catalogs that are structured similarly to those provided by the 2MASS survey. |

|**Abstract**| Galactic plane radio surveys play a key role in improving our understanding of a wide range of astrophysical phenomena from neutron stars and Galactic magnetic fields to stellar formation and evolution. Performing such a survey on the latest interferometric telescopes produces large data rates necessitating a shift towards fully or quasi-real-time data analysis with data being stored for only the time required to process them. This has instilled a need to re-devise scientific strategies and methods for the effective management of telescope observing time. We describe here the setup for the 3000 hour Max-Planck-Institut f\"ur Radioastronomie (MPIfR) MeerKAT Galactic Plane survey (MMGPS). The survey is unique by operating in a commensal mode. Key science objectives of the survey including the discovery of new pulsars and transients as well as studies of Galactic magnetism, the interstellar medium and star formation rates. We explain the strategy coupled with the necessary hardware and software infrastructure needed for data reduction in the imaging, spectral and time domains. We have so far discovered 78 new pulsars including 17 binary pulsars. We have also developed an imaging pipeline sensitive to the order of a few tens of micro-Jansky and a spatial resolution of a few arcseconds. Further science operations are about to commence with an S-Band receiver system built in-house and operated in collaboration with the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO). Spectral line commissioning observations at S-band already illustrate the spectroscopic capabilities of this instrument. These results have not only opened new avenues for Galactic science but also laid a strong foundation for surveys with future telescopes like the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). |

|**Abstract**| We present simultaneous optical and near-infrared spectra obtained during the 2021 outburst of the black hole transient 4U 1543-47. The X-ray hardness-intensity diagram and the comparison with similar systems reveal a luminous outburst, probably reaching the Eddington luminosity, as well as a long-lasting excursion to the so-called ultra-luminous state. VLT/X-shooter spectra were taken in two epochs 14 days apart during the early and brightest part of the outburst, while the source was in this ultra-luminous accretion state. The data show strong H and HeI emission lines, as well as high-excitation HeII and OIII transitions. Most lines are single-peaked in both spectra, except for the OIII lines that exhibit evident double-peaked profiles during the second epoch. The Balmer lines are embedded in broad absorption wings that we believe are mainly produced by the contribution of the A2V donor to the optical flux, which we estimate to be in the range of 11 to 14 per cent in the $r$ band during our observations. Although no conspicuous outflow features are found, we observe some wind-related line profiles, particularly in the near-infrared. Such lines include broad emission line wings and skewed red profiles, suggesting the presence of a cold (i.e. low ionisation) outflow with similar observational properties to those found in other low-inclination black hole transients. |

|**Abstract**| We revisit the cosmology of neutrino self-interaction and use the latest cosmic microwave background data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Planck experiment to constrain the interaction strength. In both flavor-universal and nonuniversal coupling scenarios, we find that the ACT data prefers strong neutrino self-interaction that delays neutrino free streaming until just before the matter-radiation equality. When combined with the Planck 2018 data, the preference for strong interaction decreases due to the Planck polarization data. For the combined dataset, the flavor-specific interaction still provides a better fit to the CMB data than $\Lambda$CDM. This trend persists even when neutrino mass is taken into account and extra radiation is added. We also study the prospect of constraining such strong interaction by future terrestrial and space telescopes, and find that the upcoming CMB-S4 experiment will improve the upper limit on neutrino self-interaction by about a factor of three. |

|| Dhruba Dutta Chowdhury, et al. -- incl., <mark>Frank C. van den Bosch</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-03-17*|

|**Abstract**| Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM), consisting of ultralight bosons, is an intriguing alternative to Cold Dark Matter. Numerical simulations solving the Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) equation, which governs FDM dynamics, show that FDM halos consist of a central solitonic core (representing the ground state of the SP equation), surrounded by a large envelope of excited states. Wave interference gives rise to order unity density fluctuations throughout the envelope and causes the soliton to undergo density oscillations and execute a confined random walk in the central region of the halo. The resulting gravitational potential perturbations are an efficient source of dynamical heating. Using high-resolution numerical simulations of a $6.6 \times 10^{9} \rm M_{\odot}$ FDM halo with boson mass, $m_{\rm b}=8 \times 10^{-23} \ \rm eV$, we investigate the impact of this dynamical heating on the structure and kinematics of spheroidal dwarf galaxies of a fixed mass but different initial sizes and ellipticities. The galaxies are set up in equilibrium in the time-and-azimuthally averaged halo potential and evolved for $10 \ \rm Gyr$ in the live FDM halo. We find that they continuously increase their sizes and central velocity dispersions. In addition, their kinematic structures become strongly radially anisotropic, especially in the outskirts. Dynamical heating also causes initially ellipsoidal galaxies to become more spherical over time from the inside out and gives rise to distorted, non-concentric isodensity contours. These tell-tale characteristics of dynamical heating of dwarf galaxies in FDM halos can potentially be used to constrain the boson mass. |

|*Appeared on*| *2023-03-17*|
|*Comments*| *Conference Proceeding - IAUS 375: The Multimessenger Chakra of Blazar Jets; 8 pages, 4 figures*|
|**Abstract**| Despite the fact that jets from black holes were first understood to exist over 40 years ago, we are still in ignorance about many primary aspects of these systems -- including the radiation mechanism at high energies, the particle makeup of the jets, and how particles are accelerated, possibly to energies as high as 100 TeV and hundreds of kpc from the central engine. We focus in particular on the discovery (and mystery) of strong X-ray emission from radio jets on kpc-scales, enabled by the unequaled high resolution of the \emph{Chandra} X-ray observatory. We review the main evidence for and against the viable models to explain this X-ray emission over the last 20 years. Finally, we present results of a recent study on the X-ray variability of kpc-scale jets, where we find evidence that between 30-100\% of the X-ray jet population is variable at the tens-of-percent level. The short ($\sim$years) variability timescale is incompatible with the IC/CMB model for the X-rays and implies extremely small structures embedded within the kpc-scale jet, and thus requires a reconsideration of many assumptions about jet structure and dynamics. |

|**Abstract**| In order to probe modifications of gravity at cosmological scales, one needs accurate theoretical predictions. N-body simulations are required to explore the non-linear regime of structure formation but are very time consuming. In this work, we build an emulator, dubbed e-MANTIS, that performs an accurate and fast interpolation between the predictions of a given set of cosmological simulations, in $f(R)$ modified gravity, run with ECOSMOG. We sample a wide 3D parameter space given by the current background scalar field value $10^{-7} < \left|f_{R_0} \right| < 10^{-4}$, matter density $0.24<\Omega_\mathrm{m}<0.39$, and primordial power spectrum normalisation $0.6<\sigma_8<1.0$, with 110 points sampled from a Latin Hypercube. For each model we perform pairs of $f(R)$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM simulations covering an effective volume of $\left(560 \, h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}\right)^3$ with a mass resolution of $\sim 2 \times 10^{10} h^{-1} M_\odot$. We compute the matter power spectrum boost due to $f(R)$ gravity $B(k)=P_{f(R)}(k)/P_{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}(k)$ and build an emulator using a Gaussian Process Regression method. The boost is mostly independent of $h$, $n_{s}$, and $\Omega_{b}$, which reduces the dimensionality of the relevant cosmological parameter space. Additionally, it is much more robust against statistical and systematic errors than the raw power spectrum, thus strongly reducing our computational needs. The resulting emulator has a maximum error of $3\%$ across the whole cosmological parameter space, for scales $0.03 \ h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} < k < 7 \ h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and redshifts $0 < z < 2$, while in most cases the accuracy is better than $1\%$. Such an emulator could be used to constrain $f(R)$ gravity with weak lensing analyses. |

|| Rebecca L. Larson, et al. -- incl., <mark>Haowen Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-03-17*|

|**Abstract**| We report the discovery of an accreting supermassive black hole at z=8.679, in CEERS_1019, a galaxy previously discovered via a Ly$\alpha$-break by Hubble and with a Ly$\alpha$ redshift from Keck. As part of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey, we observed this source with JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy, MIRI and NIRCam imaging, and NIRCam/WFSS slitless spectroscopy. The NIRSpec spectra uncover many emission lines, and the strong [O III] emission line confirms the ground-based Ly$\alpha$ redshift. We detect a significant broad (FWHM~1200 km/s) component in the H$\beta$ emission line, which we conclude originates in the broad-line region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), as the lack of a broad component in the forbidden lines rejects an outflow origin. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of high-ionization lines, as well as a spatial point-source component embedded within a smoother surface brightness profile. The mass of the black hole is log($M_{BH}/M_{\odot})=6.95{\pm}0.37$, and we estimate that it is accreting at 1.2 ($\pm$0.5) x the Eddington limit. The 1-8 $\mu$m photometric spectral energy distribution (SED) from NIRCam and MIRI shows a continuum dominated by starlight and constrains the host galaxy to be massive (log M/M$_{\odot}$~9.5) and highly star-forming (SFR~30 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). Ratios of the strong emission lines show that the gas in this galaxy is metal-poor (Z/Z$_{\odot}$~0.1), dense (n$_{e}$~10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$), and highly ionized (log U~-2.1), consistent with the general galaxy population observed with JWST at high redshifts. We use this presently highest-redshift AGN discovery to place constraints on black hole seeding models and find that a combination of either super-Eddington accretion from stellar seeds or Eddington accretion from massive black hole seeds is required to form this object by the observed epoch. |

|*Comments*| *Invited chapter for the Handbook of X-ray and Gamma-ray Astrophysics (Editors: Cosimo Bambi, Andrea Santangelo; Publisher: Springer Singapore)*|
|**Abstract**| Accreting compact objects are crucial to understand several important astrophysical phenomena such as Type Ia supernovae, gravitational waves, or X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bursts. In addition, they are natural laboratories to infer fundamental properties of stars, to investigate high-energy phenomena and accretion processes, to test theories of stellar and binary evolution, to explore interactions between high-density plasma and very strong magnetic fields, to examine the interplay between binary evolution and dynamical interactions (in the case they belong to dense star clusters), and they can even be used as a probe for the assembling process of galaxies over cosmic time-scales. Despite the fundamental importance of accreting compact objects for astrophysics and recent progress with the comprehension of these fascinating objects, we still do not fully understand how they form and evolve. In this chapter, we will review the current theoretical status of our knowledge on these objects, and will discuss standing problems and potential solutions to them. |

|**Abstract**| The properties of the matter density field in the initial conditions have a decisive impact on the features of the large-scale structure of the Universe as observed today. These need to be studied via $N$-body simulations, which are imperative to analyze high density collapsed regions into dark matter halos. In this paper, we train Machine Learning algorithms with information from N -body simulations to infer two properties: dark matter particle halo classification that leads to halo formation prediction with the characteristics of the matter density field traced back to the initial conditions, and dark matter halo formation by calculating the Halo Mass Function (HMF), which offers the number density of dark matter halos with a given threshold. We map the initial conditions of the matter density field into classification labels of dark matter halo structures. The Halo Mass Function of the simulations is calculated and reconstructed with theoretical methods as well as our trained algorithms. We test several Machine Learning techniques where we could find that the Random Forest and Neural Networks proved to be the better performing tools to classify dark matter particles in cosmological simulations. We also show that that it is not compulsory to use a high amount of data to train the algorithms in order to reconstruct the HMF, giving us a very good fitting function for both simulation and theoretical results. |

|**Abstract**| LDN1415-IRS, a low-mass young stellar object (YSO) went into an outburst between 2001 and 2006, illuminating a surrounding nebula, LDN1415-Neb. LDN1415-Neb was found to have brightened by I=3.77 mag by April 2006. The optical light curve covering $\sim$ 15.5 years, starting from October 2006 to January 2022, is presented in this study. The initial optical spectrum indicated the presence of winds in the system but the subsequent spectra have no wind indicators. The declining light curve and the absence of the P-Cygni profile in later epoch spectra indicate that the star and nebula system is retrieving back from its outburst state. Two Herbig-Haro objects (HHOs) are positioned linearly with respect to the optical brightness peak of the nebula, probably indicating the circumstellar disk being viewed edge-on. Our recent deep near-infrared (NIR) imaging using TANSPEC has revealed the presence of a nearby star-like source, south of the LDN1415-IRS, at an angular distance of $\sim$ 5.4 arcsec. |

|**Abstract**| We report a trigonometric parallax measurement of 22 GHz water masers in the massive star-forming region G034.43+0.24 as part of the Bar and Spiral Structure Legacy (BeSSeL) Survey using the Very Long Baseline Array. The parallax is 0.330$\pm$50.018 mas, corresponding to a distance of $3.03^{+0.17}_{-0.16}$ kpc. This locates G034.43+0.24 near the inner edge of the Sagittarius spiral arm and at one end of a linear distribution of massive young stars which cross nearly the full width of the arm. The measured 3-dimensional motion of G034.43+0.24 indicates a near-circular Galactic orbit. The water masers display arc-like distributions, possibly bow shocks, associated with winds from one or more massive young stars. |

|**Abstract**| The optical emission line spectra of X-ray binaries (XRBs) are thought to be produced in an irradiated atmosphere, possibly the base of a wind, located above the outer accretion disc. However, the physical nature of - and physical conditions in - the line-forming region remain poorly understood. Here, we test the idea that the optical spectrum is formed in the transition region between the cool, geometrically thin part of the disc near the mid-plane and a hot, vertically extended atmosphere or outflow produced by X-ray irradiation. We first present a VLT X-Shooter spectrum of XRB MAXI J1820+070 in the soft state associated with its 2018 outburst, which displays a rich set of double-peaked hydrogen and helium recombination lines. Aided by ancillary X-ray spectra and reddening estimates, we then model this spectrum with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code Python, using a simple biconical disc wind model inspired by radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of irradiation-driven outflows from XRB discs. Such a model can qualitatively reproduce the observed features; nearly all of the optical emission arising from the transonic 'transition region' near the base of the wind. In this region, characteristic electron densities are on the order of 10$^{12-13}$ cm$^{-3}$, in line with the observed flat Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta \approx 1.3$). We conclude that strong irradiation can naturally give rise to both the optical line-forming layer in XRB discs and an overlying outflow/atmosphere that produces X-ray absorption lines. |

|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**| We collected the archival data of blazar OJ~287 from heterogeneous very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) monitoring programs at 2.3 GHz, 8.6 GHz, 15 GHz and 43 GHz. The data reduction and observable extraction of those multi-band multi-epoch observations are batch-processed consistently with our automated pipeline. We present the multivariate correlation analysis on the observables at each band. We employ the cross-correlation function to search the correlations and the Monte Carlo (MC) technique to verify the certainty of correlations. Several correlations are found. The foremost findings are the correlations between the core flux density and the jet position angles on different scales, which validated the plausible predictions of the jet with precession characteristics. Meanwhile, there is a variation in the offset between the core EVPA and the inner-jet position angle over time at 15~GHz and 43~GHz. |

|**Abstract**| Precise measurements of the stellar orbits around Sagittarius A* have established the existence of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the Galactic centre (GC). Due to the interplay between the SMBH and dark matter (DM), the DM density profile in the innermost region of the Galaxy, which is crucial for the DM indirect detection, is still an open question. Among the most popular models in the literature, the theoretical spike profile proposed by Gondolo and Silk (1999; GS hereafter) is well adopted. In this work, we investigate the DM spike profile using updated data from the Keck and VLT telescopes considering that the presence of such an extended mass component may affect the orbits of the S-stars in the Galactic center. We examine the radius and slope of the generalized NFW spike profile, analyze the Einasto spike, and discuss the influence of DM annihilation on the results. Our findings indicate that an initial slope of $\gamma \gtrsim 0.92$ for the generalized NFW spike profile is ruled out at a 95% confidence level. Additionally, the spike radius $R_{\rm sp}$ larger than 21.5 pc is rejected at 95% probability for the Einasto spike with $\alpha=0.17$, which also contradicts the GS spike model. The constraints with the VLT/GRAVITY upper limits are also projected. Although the GS NFW spike is well constrained by the Keck and VLT observation of S2, an NFW spike with a weak annihilation cusp may still be viable, as long as the DM annihilation cross section satisfies $\left< \sigma v \right> \gtrsim 7.7\times 10^{-27}~{\rm cm^3\,s^{-1}} (m_{\rm DM}/100~{\rm GeV})$ at 95% level. |

|**Abstract**| The transformation and evolution of a galaxy is strongly influenced by interactions with its environment. Neutral hydrogen (\HI) is an excellent way to trace these interactions. Here, we present \HI\ observations of the spiral galaxy NGC~895, which was previously thought to be isolated. High-sensitivity \HI\ observations from the MeerKAT large survey project MIGHTEE reveal possible interaction features, such as extended spiral arms, and the two newly discovered \HI\ companions, that drive us to change the narrative that it is an isolated galaxy. We combine these observations with deep optical images from the Hyper Suprime Camera to show an absence of tidal debris between NGC 895 and its companions. We do find an excess of light in the outer parts of the companion galaxy MGTH$\_$J022138.1-052631 which could be an indication of external perturbation and thus possible sign of interactions. Our analysis shows that NGC~895 is an actively star-forming galaxy with a SFR of $\mathrm{1.75 \pm 0.09 [M_{\odot}/yr]}$, a value typical for high stellar mass galaxies on the star forming main sequence. It is reasonable to state that different mechanisms may have contributed to the observed features in NGC~895 and this emphasizes the need to revisit the target with more detailed observations. Our work shows the high potential and synergy of using state-of-the-art data in both \HI\ and optical to reveal a more complete picture of galaxy environments. |

|**Abstract**| A group of massive galaxies at redshifts of $z\geq 6.5$ have been recently detected by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which were unexpected to form at such early times within the standard Big Bang cosmology. In this work we propose that the formation of some $\sim 50~M_\odot$ primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early Universe via super-Eddington accretion within the dark matter halo can explain these observations. These PBHs may act as seeds for early galaxies formation with masses of $\sim 10^{9}-10^{10}~M_\odot$ at $z\sim 8$, hence accounting for the JWST observations. We use a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework to constrain the PBH mass distribution models, and find that the Lognormal model with the $M_{\rm c}\sim 35M_\odot$ is strongly preferred over other hypotheses. These rapidly growing BHs are expected to have strong radiation and may appear as the high-redshift compact objects, similar to those recently discovered by JWST. |

|**Abstract**| We systematically investigate the claim by Vandorou et al. (2023) to have detected the host star of the low mass-ratio ($q<10^{-4}$) microlensing planet OGLE-2016-BLG-1195Lb, via Keck adaptive optics (AO) measurements $\Delta t=4.12\,$yr after the peak of the event ($t_0$). If correct, this measurement would contradict the microlens parallax measurement derived from Spitzer observations in solar orbit taken near $t_0$. We show that this host identification would be in $4\,\sigma$ conflict with the original ground-based lens-source relative proper-motion measurements. By contrast, Gould (2022) estimated a probability $p=10\%$ that the ``other star'' resolved by single-epoch late-time AO would be a companion to the host or the microlensed source, which is much more probable than a 4$\,\sigma$ statistical fluctuation. In addition, independent of this proper-motion discrepancy, the kinematics of this host-identification are substantially less probable than those of the Spitzer solution. Hence, this identification should not be accepted, pending additional observations that would either confirm or contradict it, which could be taken in 2023. Motivated by this tension, we present two additional investigations. We explore the possibility that Vandorou et al. (2023) identified the wrong ``star'' (or stellar asterism) on which to conduct their analysis. We find that astrometry of KMT and Keck images favors a star (or asterism) lying about 175 mas northwest of the one that they chose. We also present event parameters from a combined fit to all survey data, which yields, in particular, a more precise mass ratio, $q=(4.6\pm 0.4)\times 10^{-5}$. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of minimizing such false positives for the first measurement of the planet mass function, which will become possible when AO on next-generation telescopes are applied to microlensing planets. |
