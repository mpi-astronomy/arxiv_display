|**Abstract**| We report the discovery of two exoplanets around the M dwarfs GJ 724 and GJ 3988 using the radial velocity (RV) method. We obtained a total of 153 3.5 m Calar Alto/CARMENES spectra for both targets and measured their RVs and activity indicators. We also added archival ESO/HARPS data for GJ 724 and infrared RV measurements from Subaru/IRD for GJ 3988. We searched for periodic and stable signals to subsequently construct Keplerian models, considering different numbers of planets, and we selected the best models based on their Bayesian evidence. Gaussian process (GP) regression was included in some models to account for activity signals. For both systems, the best model corresponds to one single planet. The minimum masses are $10.75^{+0.96}_{-0.87}$ and $3.69^{+0.42}_{-0.41}$ Earth-masses for GJ 724 b and GJ 3988 b, respectively. Both planets have short periods (P < 10 d) and, therefore, they orbit their star closely (a < 0.05 au). GJ 724 b has an eccentric orbit (e = $0.577^{+0.055}_{-0.052}$), whereas the orbit of GJ 3988 b is circular. The high eccentricity of GJ 724 b makes it the most eccentric single exoplanet (to this date) around an M dwarf. Thus, we suggest a further analysis to understand its configuration in the context of planetary formation and architecture. In contrast, GJ 3988 b is an example of a common type of planet around mid-M dwarfs. |

|**Abstract**| Studying small near-Earth asteroids is important to understand their dynamical histories and origins as well as to mitigate the damage of the asteroid impact to the Earth. We report the results of multicolor photometry of the tiny near-Earth asteroid 2015 RN$_{35}$ using the 3.8 m Seimei telescope in Japan and the TRAPPIST-South telescope in Chile over 17 nights in 2022 December and 2023 January. We observed 2015 RN$_{35}$ across a wide range of phase angles from 2$^{\circ}$ to 30$^{\circ}$ in the $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$ bands in the Pan-STARRS system. These lightcurves show that 2015 RN$_{35}$ is in a non-principal axis spin state with two characteristic periods of $1149.7\pm0.3$ s and $896.01\pm0.01$ s. We found that a slope of a visible spectrum of 2015 RN$_{35}$ is as red as asteroid (269) Justitia, one of the very red objects in the main belt, which indicates that 2015 RN$_{35}$ can be classified as an A- or Z-type asteroid. In conjunction with the shallow slope of the phase curve, we suppose that 2015 RN$_{35}$ is a high-albedo A-type asteroid. We demonstrated that surface properties of tiny asteroids could be well constrained by intensive observations across a wide range of phase angles. 2015 RN$_{35}$ is a possible mission accessible A-type near-Earth asteroid with a small $\Delta v$ of 11.801 km s$^{-1}$ in the launch window between 2030 and 2035. |

|**Abstract**| Synthesized in the cores of stars and supernovae, most metals disperse over cosmic scales and are ultimately deposited well outside the gravitational potential of their host galaxies. Since their presence is well visible through their X-ray emission lines in the hot gas pervading galaxy clusters, measuring metal abundances in the intracluster medium (ICM) offers us a unique view of chemical enrichment of the Universe as a whole. Despite extraordinary progress in the field thanks to four decades of X-ray spectroscopy using CCD (and gratings) instruments, understanding the precise stellar origins of the bulk of metals, and when the latter were mixed on Mpc scales, requires an X-ray mission capable of spatial, non-dispersive high resolution spectroscopy covering at least the soft X-ray band over a large field of view. In this White Paper, we demonstrate how the Line Emission Mapper (LEM) probe mission concept will revolutionize our current picture of the ICM enrichment. Specifically, we show that LEM will be able to (i) spatially map the distribution of ten key chemical elements out to the virial radius of a nearby relaxed cluster and (ii) measure metal abundances in serendipitously discovered high-redshift protoclusters. Altogether, these key observables will allow us to constrain the chemical history of the largest gravitationally bound structures of the Universe. They will also solve key questions such as the universality of the initial mass function (IMF) and the initial metallicity of the stellar populations producing these metals, as well as the relative contribution of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, core-collapse, and Type Ia supernovae to enrich the cosmic web over Mpc scales. Concrete observing strategies are also briefly discussed. |
