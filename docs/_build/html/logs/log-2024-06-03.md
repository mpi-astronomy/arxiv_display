|**Abstract**|            With stunning clarity, JWST has revealed the Universe's first billion years. The scientific community is analyzing a wealth of JWST imaging and spectroscopic data from that era, and is in the process of rewriting the astronomy textbooks. Here, 1.5 years into the JWST science mission, we provide a snapshot of the great progress made towards understanding the initial chapters of our cosmic history. We highlight discoveries and breakthroughs, topics and issues that are not yet understood, and questions that will be addressed in the coming years, as JWST continues its revolutionary observations of the Early Universe. While this compendium is written by a small number of authors, invited to ISSI Bern in March 2024 as part of the 2024 ISSI Breakthrough Workshop, we acknowledge the work of a large community that is advancing our collective understanding of the evolution of the Early Universe.         |

|**Abstract**|            New longwave HgCdTe detectors are critical to upcoming plans for ground-based infrared astronomy. These detectors, with fast-readouts and deep well-depths, will be key components of extremely large telescope instruments and therefore must be well understood prior to deployment. We analyze one such HgCdTe detector, a Teledyne Imaging Sensors GeoSnap, at the University of Michigan. We find that the properties of the GeoSnap are consistent with expectations from analysis of past devices. The GeoSnap has a well-depth of 2.75 million electrons per pixel, a read noise of 360 e-/pix, and a dark current of 330,000 e-/s/pix at 45 K. The device experiences 1/f noise which can be mitigated relative to half-well shot noise with modest frequency image differencing. The GeoSnap's quantum efficiency is calculated to be 79.7 +- 8.3 % at 10.6 microns. Although the GeoSnap's bad pixel fraction, on the order of 3%, is consistent with other GeoSnap devices, close to a third of the bad pixels in this detector are clustered in a series of 31 "leopard" spots spread across the detector plane. We report these properties and identify additional analyses that will be performed on future GeoSnap detectors.         |

|| M. Hammond, et al. -- incl., <mark>L. Kreidberg</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            Eclipse mapping uses the shape of the eclipse of an exoplanet to measure its two-dimensional structure. Light curves are mostly composed of longitudinal information, with the latitudinal information only contained in the brief ingress and egress of the eclipse. This imbalance can lead to a spuriously confident map, where the longitudinal structure is constrained by out-of-eclipse data and the latitudinal structure is wrongly determined by the priors on the map. We present a new method to address this issue. The method tests for the presence of an eclipse mapping signal by using k-fold cross-validation to compare the performance of a simple mapping model to the null hypothesis of a uniform disk. If a signal is found, the method fits a map with more degrees of freedom, optimising its information content. The information content is varied by penalising the model likelihood by a factor proportional to the spatial entropy of the map, optimised by cross-validation. We demonstrate this method for simulated datasets then apply it to three observational datasets. The method identifies an eclipse mapping signal for JWST MIRI/LRS observations of WASP-43b but does not identify a signal for JWST NIRISS/SOSS observations of WASP-18b or Spitzer Space Telescope observations of HD 189733b. It is possible to fit eclipse maps to these datasets, but we suggest that these maps are overfitting the eclipse shape. We fit a new map with more spatial freedom to the WASP-43b dataset and show a flatter east-west structure than previously derived.         |
