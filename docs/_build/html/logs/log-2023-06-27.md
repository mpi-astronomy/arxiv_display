|**Abstract**| The heavy element abundance profiles in galaxies place stringent constraint on galaxy growth and assembly history. Low-redshift galaxies generally have a negative metallicity gradient in their gas and stars. Such gradients are thought to be a natural manifestation of galaxy inside-out formation. As the Milky Way is currently the only spiral galaxy in which we can measure temporally-resolved chemical abundances, it enables unique insights into the origin of metallicity gradients and their correlation with the growth history of galaxies. However, until now, these unique abundance profiles had not been translated into the integrated-light measurements needed to seamlessly compare with the general galaxy population. Here we report the first measurement of the light-weighted, integrated stellar metallicity profile of our Galaxy. We find that the integrated metallicity profile of the Milky Way has a '$\wedge$'-shape broken metallicity profile, with a mildly positive gradient inside a Galactocentric radius of 7 kpc and a steep negative gradient outside. This metallicity profile appears unusual when compared to Milky Way-mass star-forming galaxies observed in the MaNGA survey and simulated in the TNG50 cosmological simulation. The analysis of the TNG50 simulated galaxies suggests that the Milky Way's positive inner gradient may be due to an inside-out quenching process. The steep negative gradient in the outer disc, however, is challenging to explain in the simulations. Our results suggest the Milky Way may not be a typical spiral galaxy for its mass regarding metallicity distribution and thus offers insight into the variety of galaxy enrichment processes. |

|**Abstract**| [Abridged] The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will be one of several flagship survey facilities operating over the next decade starting $\sim$2025. The deep near-IR imaging that Roman will deliver will be highly complementary to the capabilities of other survey telescopes that will operate contemporaneously, particularly those that can provide data at different wavelengths and messengers, or different time intervals. Combining data from multiple facilities can provide important astrophysical insights, provided the data acquisition is carefully scheduled, and careful plans are made for appropriate joint data analyses. In this White Paper, we discuss the broad range of science that would be enabled by coordinating Roman observations of the Galactic Bulge with those of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Specifically, we discuss how Roman's characterization of lensing events caused by exoplanets, stellar systems and stellar remnants can be enhanced by data from Rubin. The same data will also be highly advantageous for the determination of stellar properties, and for distinguishing exoplanetary transits. It will enable more accurate period-color-luminosity relationships to be measured for RR~Lyrae throughout the Milky Way Bulge and Bar, probing galactic structure and dynamics. But we stress that this is only a sample of the full potential and advocate for a more complete study to be made as a joint effort between these major projects. We note that we do not suggest any changes beyond the established Science Requirements for the RGBTDS, in terms of survey footprint or filter selection. |
