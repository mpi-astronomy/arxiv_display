|**Abstract**|            Rings and gaps are among the most widely observed forms of substructure in protoplanetary disks. A gap-ring pair may be formed when a planet carves a gap in the disk, which produces a local pressure maximum following the gap that traps inwardly drifting dust grains and appears as a bright ring due to the enhanced dust density. A dust-trapping ring would provide a promising environment for solid growth and possibly planetesimal production via the streaming instability. We present evidence of dust trapping in the bright ring of the planet-hosting disk Elias 2-24, from the analysis of 1.3 mm and 3 mm ALMA observations at high spatial resolution (0.029 arcsec, 4.0 au). We leverage the high spatial resolution to demonstrate that larger grains are more efficiently trapped and place constraints on the local turbulence ($8 \times 10^{-4} < \alpha_\mathrm{turb} < 0.03$) and the gas-to-dust ratio ($\Sigma_g / \Sigma_d < 30$) in the ring. Using a scattering-included marginal probability analysis we measure a total dust disk mass of $M_\mathrm{dust} = 13.8^{+0.7}_{-0.5} \times 10^{-4} \ M_\odot$. We also show that at the orbital radius of the proposed perturber, the gap is cleared of material down to a flux contrast of 10$^{-3}$ of the peak flux in the disk.         |

|**Abstract**|            The star formation rate (SFR) is tightly connected to the amount of dense gas in molecular clouds. However, it is not fully understood how the relationship between dense molecular gas and star formation varies within galaxies and in different morphological environments. In this work, we study dense gas and star formation in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4321 to test how the amount of dense gas and its ability to form stars varies with environmental properties at 260 pc scales. We present new ALMA observations of HCN(1-0) line emission. Combined with existing CO(2-1) observations from ALMA, and H-alpha from MUSE, as well as F2100W from JWST to trace the SFR, we measure the HCN/CO line ratio, a proxy for the dense gas fraction and SFR/HCN, a proxy for the star formation efficiency of the dense gas. Towards the centre of the galaxy, HCN/CO systematically increases while SFR/HCN decreases, but these ratios stay roughly constant throughout the disc. Spiral arms, interarm regions, and bar ends show similar HCN/CO and SFR/HCN. On the bar, there is a significantly lower SFR/HCN at a similar HCN/CO. We conclude that the centres of galaxies show the strongest environmental influence on dense gas and star formation, suggesting either that clouds couple strongly to the surrounding pressure or that HCN is tracing more of the bulk molecular gas that is less efficiently converted into stars. On the contrary, across the disc of NGC 4321, where the ISM pressure is typically low, SFR/HCN does not show large variations (< 0.3 dex) in agreement with Galactic observations of molecular clouds. Despite the large variations across environments and physical conditions, HCN/CO is a good predictor of the mean molecular gas surface density at 260 pc scales.         |
