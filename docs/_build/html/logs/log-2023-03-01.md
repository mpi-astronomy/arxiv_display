|**Abstract**| The latest High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) point-like source catalog up to 56 TeV reported the detection of two sources in the region of the Galactic plane at galactic longitude 52\deg < l < 55\deg, 3HWC J1930+188 and 3HWC J1928+178. The first one is associated with a known TeV source, the supernova remnant SNR G054.1+00.3. It was discovered by one of the currently operating Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (IACT), the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), detected by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), and identified as a composite SNR. However, the source 3HWC J1928+178, discovered by HAWC and coincident with the pulsar PSR J1928+1746, was not detected by any IACT despite their long exposure on the region, until a recent new analysis of H.E.S.S. data was able to confirm it. Moreover, no X-ray counterpart has been detected from this pulsar. We present a multicomponent fit of this region using the latest HAWC data. This reveals an additional new source, HAWC J1932+192, which is potentially associated with the pulsar PSR J1932+1916, whose gamma-ray emission could come from the acceleration of particles in its pulsar wind nebula. In the case of 3HWC J1928+178, several possible explanations are explored, in a attempt to unveil the origins of the very-high-energy gamma-ray emission. |

|| <mark>Jiaxuan Li</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-03-01*|

|**Abstract**| Recent observations have reignited interest in a population of dwarf galaxies that are large and diffuse for their mass, often called ultra-diffuse galaxies. However, the origin and evolution of these mass-size outliers and the role of environment are still unclear. Using the exquisitely deep and wide Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey images, we search for ultra-puffy galaxies, defined as being $1.5\sigma$ larger than the average size for their mass, around Milky-Way--like galaxies. We present the size and radial distributions of mass-size outliers, and derive their quenched fraction to explore the impact of environment. Surprisingly, despite being outliers in size, the ultra-puffy galaxies have a similar quenched fraction as normal-sized satellites of Milky Way analogs in both observations and simulations, suggesting that quenching is not tied to being a mass-size outlier. The quenched fraction is higher for the ultra-puffy galaxies associated with redder hosts as well as those that are closer to the host in projection. In contrast, the ultra-diffuse galaxies are overall redder and more quiescent compared with normal satellites. We show that the classic definition of ultra-diffuse galaxies is heavily weighted towards quenched galaxies and thus cannot be used for a study of quenching of mass-size outliers. |

|| Akshatha K. Vydula, et al. -- incl., <mark>David Lewis</mark> |

|**Abstract**| Diffuse radio recombination lines (RRLs) in the Galaxy are possible foregrounds for redshifted 21~cm experiments. We use EDGES drift scans centered at $-26.7^{\circ}$~declination to characterize diffuse RRLs across the southern sky. We find RRLs averaged over the large antenna beam ($72^{\circ} \times 110^{\circ}$) reach minimum amplitudes between right ascensions~2-6~h. In this region, the C$\alpha$ absorption amplitude is $33\pm11$~mK (1$\sigma$) averaged over 50-87~MHz ($27\gtrsim z \gtrsim15$ for the 21~cm line) and increases strongly as frequency decreases. C$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ lines are consistent with no detection with amplitudes of $13\pm14$ and $12\pm10$~mK (1$\sigma$), respectively. For 108-124.5~MHz ($z\approx11$), we find no evidence for hydrogen or carbon lines at the noise level of 3.4~mK (1$\sigma$). Conservatively assuming observed lines come broadly from the diffuse interstellar medium, as opposed to a few specific regions, these amplitudes provide upper limits on the intrinsic diffuse lines. The observations support expectations that Galactic RRLs can be neglected as significant foregrounds for a large region of sky until redshifted 21~cm experiments, particularly those targeting Cosmic Dawn, move beyond the detection phase. For C$\alpha$, we find a best-fit departure coefficient product, $b_n \beta_n$, that varies smoothly as a function of frequency between $0.79<b_n\beta_n<4.5$ along the inner Galactic Plane and between $0<b_n\beta_n<2.3$ away from the inner Galactic Plane, yields better agreement between model and data than assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. |

|**Abstract**| Purpose: We present the five-year in-orbit background evolution of Insight-HXMT since the launch, as well as the effects of the background model in data analysis. Methods: The backgrounds of the three main payloads, i.e., Low-Energy Telescope, Medium-Energy Telescope and High-Energy Telescope, are described, respectively. The evolution of the background over time is obtained by simply comparing the background in every year during the in-orbit operation of Insight-HXMT. Results: The major observational characteristics of the Insight-HXMT in-orbit background are presented, including the light curve, spectrum, geographical distribution, and long-term evolution. The systematic error in background estimation is investigated for every year. Conclusion: The observational characteristics of the five-year in-orbit background are consistent with our knowledge of the satellite design and the space environment, and the background model is still valid for the latest observations of Insight-HXMT. |

|**Abstract**| Including millimeter-wave (mm-wave) data in multi-wavelength studies of the variability of active galactic nuclei (AGN) can provide insights into AGN physics that are not easily accessible at other wavelengths. We demonstrate in this work the potential of cosmic microwave background (CMB) telescopes to provide long-term, high-cadence mm-wave AGN monitoring over large fractions of sky. We report on a pilot study using data from the SPTpol instrument on the South Pole Telescope (SPT), which was designed to observe the CMB at arcminute and larger angular scales. Between 2013 and 2016, SPTpol was used primarily to observe a single 500 deg^2 field, covering the entire field several times per day with detectors sensitive to radiation in bands centered at 95 and 150 GHz. We use SPT 150 GHz observations to create AGN light curves, and we compare these mm-wave light curves to those at other wavelengths, in particular gamma-ray and optical. In this Letter, we focus on a single source, PKS 2326-502, which has extensive, day-timescale monitoring data in gamma-ray, optical, and now mm-wave between 2013 and 2016. We find PKS 2326-502 to be in a flaring state in the first two years of this monitoring, and we present a search for evidence of correlated variability between mm-wave, optical R band, and gamma-ray observations. This pilot study is paving the way for AGN monitoring with current and upcoming CMB experiments such as SPT-3G, Simons Observatory, and CMB-S4, including multi-wavelength studies with facilities such as VRO-LSST. |

|**Abstract**| The stellar population environments associated with fast radio burst (FRB) sources provide important insights for developing their progenitor theories. We expand the diversity of known FRB host environments by reporting two FRBs in massive galaxy clusters discovered by the Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-110) during its commissioning observations. FRB 20220914A has been localized to a star-forming, late-type galaxy at a redshift of 0.1139 with multiple starbursts at lookback times less than $\sim$3.5 Gyr in the Abell 2310 galaxy cluster. Although the host galaxy of FRB 20220914A is similar to typical FRB hosts, the FRB 20220509G host stands out as a quiescent, early-type galaxy at a redshift of 0.0894 in the Abell 2311 galaxy cluster. The discovery of FRBs in both late and early-type galaxies adds to the body of evidence that the FRB sources have multiple formation channels. Therefore, even though FRB hosts are typically star-forming, there must exist formation channels consistent with old stellar population in galaxies. The varied star formation histories of the two FRB hosts we report indicate a wide delay-time distribution of FRB progenitors. Future work in constraining the FRB delay-time distribution, using methods we develop herein, will prove crucial in determining the evolutionary histories of FRB sources. |

|*Appeared on*| *2023-03-01*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted in MNRAS 2023 February 28. Received 2023 February 28; in original form 2022 July 09*|
|**Abstract**| Using the modelling code X-CIGALE, we reproduced the SEDs of 1,359 SDSS QSOs within the redshift range 0 < z < 4, for which we have NIR/MIR fluxes with the highest quality and spectral data characterizing their SMBHs. Consistent with a rapid formation of the host galaxies, the star formation histories (SFHs) have small e-folding, at most 750 Myrs using an SFH function for Spiral or 1000 Myrs using one for Elliptical. Above z \sim 1.6, the two solutions are degenerate, the SEDs being dominated by the AGN continuum and high star formation rates (SFRs), typical of starburst galaxies, while at lower redshifts the starburst nature of the host, independent from its morphology, is better reproduced by an Spiral SFH. In general, the SFR increases with the redshift, the mass of the bulge, the AGN luminosity and Eddington ratio, suggesting there is no evidence of AGN quenching of star formation. Comparing the specific BHAR with specific SFR, all the QSOs at any redshift trace a linear sequence below the Eddington luminosity, in parallel and above the one-to-one relation, implying that QSOs are in a special phase of evolution during which the growth in mass of their SMBH is more rapid than the growth in mass of their galaxy hosts. This particular phase is consistent with a scenario where the galaxy hosts of QSOs in the past grew in mass more rapidly than their SMBHs, suggesting that a high star formation efficiency during their formation was responsible in limiting their masses |

|**Abstract**| The hot gas that constitutes the intracluster medium (ICM) has been studied at X-ray and millimeter/sub-millimeter wavelengths (Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect) for decades. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) offer an additional method of directly measuring the ICM and gas surrounding clusters, via observables such as dispersion measure (DM) and Faraday rotation measure (RM). We report the discovery of two FRB sources detected with the Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-110) whose host galaxies belong to massive galaxy clusters. In both cases, the FRBs exhibit excess extragalactic DM, some of which likely originates in the ICM of their respective clusters. FRB 20220914A resides in the galaxy cluster Abell 2310 at z=0.1125 with a projected offset from the cluster center of 520 kpc. The host of a second source, FRB 20220509G, is an elliptical galaxy at z=0.0894 that belongs to the galaxy cluster Abell 2311 at projected offset of 870 kpc. These sources represent the first time an FRB has been localized to a galaxy cluster. We combine our FRB data with archival X-ray, SZ, and optical observations of these clusters in order to infer properties of the ICM, including a measurement of gas temperature from DM and ySZ of 0.8-3.9 keV. We then compare our results to massive cluster halos from the IllustrisTNG simulation. Finally, we describe how large samples of localized FRBs from future surveys will constrain the ICM, particularly beyond the virial radius of clusters. |

|| Kate Pattle, <mark>Walter Gear</mark>, Christine D. Wilson |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-03-01*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in MNRAS. 15 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables (plus 15 pages of appendices, with 31 figures)*|
|**Abstract**| We present 850$\mu$m observations of a sample of 8 nearby spiral galaxies, made using the SCUBA-2 camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) as part of the JCMT Nearby Galaxies Legacy Survey (NGLS). We corrected our data for the presence of the $^{12}$CO $J=3\to 2$ line in the SCUBA-2 850$\mu$m bandwidth using NGLS HARP data, finding a typical $^{12}$CO contribution of $\sim 20$%. We measured dust column densities, temperatures and opacity indices by fitting spectral energy distributions constructed from SCUBA-2 and archival Herschel observations, and used archival GALEX and Spitzer data to make maps of surface density of star formation ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$). Typically, comparing SCUBA-2-derived H$_2$ surface densities ($\Sigma_{\rm H_2}$) to $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ gives shallow star formation law indices within galaxies, with SCUBA-2-derived values typically being sublinear and Herschel-derived values typically being broadly linear. This difference is likely due to the effects of atmospheric filtering on the SCUBA-2 data. Comparing the mean values of $\Sigma_{\rm H_2}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ of the galaxies in our sample returns a steeper star formation law index, broadly consistent with both the Kennicutt-Schmidt value of 1.4 and linearity. Our results show that a SCUBA-2 detection is a good predictor of star formation. We suggest that Herschel emission traces gas in regions which will form stars on timescales $\sim 5-100$ Myr, comparable to the star formation timescale traced by GALEX and Spitzer data, while SCUBA-2 preferentially traces the densest gas within these regions, which likely forms stars on shorter timescales. |

|**Abstract**| Local galaxies are known to broadly follow a bimodal distribution: actively star forming and quiescent system (i.e. galaxies with no or negligible star formation activity at the epoch of observation). Why, when and how such bimodality was established, and whether it has been associated with different processes at different cosmic epochs, is still a key open question in extragalactic astrophysics. Directly observing early quiescent galaxies in the primordial Universe is therefore of utmost importance to constraining models of galaxy formation and transformation. Early quiescent galaxies have been identified out to redshift $z < 5$, and these are all found to be massive ($M_{*}>10^{10}~M_{\odot}$). Here we report the discovery of a quiescent galaxy at z$=$7.3, when the Universe was only 700 Myr old - about 5% of its current age. The JWST/NIRSpec spectrum of this galaxy from our JADES programme exhibits a complete absence of nebular emission lines, while the Balmer break and Ly$\alpha$ drop are unambiguously detected. We infer that this galaxy experienced a short and intense burst of star formation followed by rapid quenching, about 10-20 Myr before the epoch of observation. Particularly interesting is that the mass of this quiescent galaxy is only $\sim$4-6$\times 10^8~M_{\odot}$. This mass range is sensitive to various feedback mechanisms that can result in temporary or permanent quiescence. Therefore this galaxy represents a unique opportunity to learn more about galaxy formation and transformation in the early Universe. |
