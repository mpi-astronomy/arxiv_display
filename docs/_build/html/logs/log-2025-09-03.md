|**Abstract**|            Spiral arms play a central role in disc galaxies, but their dynamical nature remains a long-standing open question. Azimuthal offsets between molecular gas and star formation are expected if gas crosses spiral arms, as predicted by quasi-stationary density wave theory. In this work, we measure offsets between CO and Halpha peaks in radial bins for 24 galaxies from the PHANGS survey that display a well-delineated spiral structure. The offsets exhibit substantial scatter, implying that star formation is not exclusively initiated at a coherent spiral shock. We define offsets such that positive values mean Halpha peaks lie ahead of CO peaks in the direction of galactic rotation. With this convention, 14 galaxies show mean positive CO-Halpha offsets, typically of a few hundred parsecs. In four of these 14 galaxies (17% of the total), offsets become smaller with increasing radius, as expected for a single quasi-stationary spiral density wave. Ten galaxies (42%) show positive mean offsets but no clear correlation with radius, which is compatible with multiple overlapping modes. In the remaining ten galaxies (42%), we find no significantly positive offsets, which could point to transient dynamical spirals or material arms, where gas and stars co-rotate with the spiral perturbation. Across the full sample, we find mostly positive offsets between CO peaks and the gravitational potential minimum, confirming that gas often crosses the spiral perturbation. For the four galaxies with clear positive offsets and a radial trend, we derived pattern speeds in good agreement with the literature. Overall, our results suggest that even well-delineated spirals in the local Universe can arise from a variety of underlying dynamical mechanisms.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the science drivers for the Far-Infrared Enhanced Survey Spectrometer (FIRESS), one of two science instrument on the PRobe Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA). FIRESS is designed to meet science objectives in the areas of the origins of planetary atmospheres, the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes, and the buildup of heavy elements in the Universe. In addition to these drivers, FIRESS is envisioned as a versatile far-infrared spectrometer, capable of addressing science questions in most areas of astrophysics and planetary astronomy as part of a dominant General Observer (GO) program with 2/3 of the current science cases using FIRESS. We summarize how the instrument design choices and parameters enable the main science drivers as well as a broad and vibrant GO program.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present observations and detailed modeling of a protoplanetary disk around the T Tauri star, V1098 Sco. Millimeter wavelength data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) show a ring of large dust grains with a central cavity that is filled with molecular gas. Near-infrared data with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) detect the scattered starlight from the disk surface and reveal a large shadow that extends over it's entire southern half. We model the ALMA continuum and line data to determine the outer disk geometry and the central stellar mass. Using radiative transfer models, we demonstrate that a misaligned inner disk, tilted in both inclination and position angle with respect to the outer disk, can reproduce the salient scattered light features seen with the VLT. Applying an image threshold algorithm to compare disk morphologies and training a neural network on a set of high signal-to-noise models, we forward model the data and determine the inner disk geometry. We find that the rotation axes of the inner and outer disks are misaligned by 38 degrees and constrain the mass and location of a perturbing planetary or substellar companion. The technique of simulation based inference that is illustrated here is broadly applicable for radiative transfer modeling of other objects.         |

|**Abstract**|            The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) is an infrared observatory for the next decade, currently in Phase A, with a 1.8m telescope actively cooled to 4.5K. On board, an infrared camera, PRIMAger, equipped with ultra-sensitive kinetic inductance detector (KID) arrays, will provide observers with coverage of mid-infrared to far-infrared wavelengths from 24 to 264 microns. PRIMAger will offer two imaging modes: the Hyperspectral mode will cover the 24-84 microns wavelength range with a spectral resolution R=8, while the Polarimetric mode will provide polarimetric imaging in 4 broad bands, from 80 to 264 microns. These observational capabilities have been tailored to answer fundamental astrophysical questions such as black hole and star-formation co-evolution in galaxies, the evolution of small dust grains over a wide range of redshifts, and the effects of interstellar magnetic fields in various environments, as well as to open a vast discovery space with versatile photometric and polarimetric capabilities. PRIMAger is being developed by an international collaboration bringing together French institutes (Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille and CEA) through the center National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES, France), the Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON, Netherlands), and the Cardiff University (UK) in Europe, as well as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in the USA.         |

|**Abstract**|            Magnetic reconnection driving two-sided-loop jet is typically associated with interactions between an emerging bipole and the overlying horizontal magnetic field, or between filaments from separate magnetic systems. Leveraging high temporal and spatial resolution observations from ground-based and space-borne instruments, we have identified a two-sided-loop jet originating from magnetic reconnection between threads within a single filament. Our observations show that as two initially crossing filamentary threads within the filament converge, reconnection takes place at their intersection. In the Doppler images, distinct redshift and blueshift signals are observed at the locations where the filament threads intersected. This process generates a two-sided-loop jet with outflow speeds of \speed{22.2} and \speed{62.5}. Following reconnection, the original crossing threads transform into two parallel threads that subsequently separate at speeds of \speed{2.8} and \speed{8.3}. This observation offers a new perspective on the mechanisms responsible for jet formation.         |

|| H. Yan, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-09-03*|

|**Abstract**|            White dwarfs (WDs) represent the final evolutionary stage of most stars, typically originating from progenitor stars with masses below approximately 8 $M_{\odot}$ to 10 $M_{\odot}$. Formation through single-star evolution generally requires at least 25 Myr, with the youngest WDs often near the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 $M_{\odot}$. In contrast, WDs formed via binary channels, such as mergers or mass transfer, can develop smaller masses in a shorter timescale and may exhibit unique characteristics, including strong surface magnetic fields and rapid rotation. Accurately determining the ages of these WDs is essential for understanding their formation. A valuable method involves studying WDs in star clusters, where member stars share the same age and chemical composition, allowing for precise constraints on the formation times and metallicities of the WDs' progenitors. Here we report a WD found in the open cluster RSG 5, which is only 35 Myr old. The WD's mass is lower than 1.05 $M_{\odot}$, indicating it may not have formed through single-star evolution. The WD possesses an exceptionally strong surface magnetic field ($\ge 200$ MG), a short rotational period ($\sim 6.5$ min), and, most notably, a co-rotating half-ring of ionized circumstellar debris. This distinctive feature provides evidence for a binary merger origin, a scenario further substantiated by our stellar evolution models.         |

|*Comments*| *10 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in A&A*|
|**Abstract**|            Acetamide (CH$_{3}$CONH$_{2}$), a key interstellar amide and a methyl derivative of formamide (NH$_{2}$CHO), has been sparsely detected, limiting insights into its prebiotic relevance. We present the first systematic survey for acetamide toward 52 hot molecular cores using ALMA Band 6 data. Acetamide has been detected in 10 cores, markedly expanding the inventory of known emitters. The derived column densities of acetamide range from $(2.5\pm0.9)\times10^{14}$ to $(1.5\pm0.6)\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$, compared to formamide's $(1.1\pm0.1)\times10^{15}$ to $(6.9\pm0.4)\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$. The nearly constant abundance ratios (~3-9) and strong abundance correlation between the two amides across sources suggest a chemically linked formation pathway, likely on grain surfaces. The presence of peptide-like molecules in these regions implies that complex organic species can survive star formation processes, offering a potential pathway toward prebiotic chemistry. These findings constrain the dominant grain surface formation routes of acetamide, confirm its broader prevalence in highmass star-forming regions, and underscore the importance of targeted amide surveys in tracing the chemical evolution toward prebiotic complexity.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report JWST/MIRI 15 $\mu$m phase curves of TRAPPIST-1 b and c, revealing thermal emission consistent with their irradiation levels, assuming no efficient heat redistribution. We find that TRAPPIST-1 b shows a high dayside brightness temperature (490 $\pm$ 17 K), no significantly detectable nightside emission ($F_{\rm b, Night, max}$ = $39_{-27}^{+55}$ ppm), and no phase offset -- features consistent with a low-albedo, airless ultramafic rocky surface. TRAPPIST-1 c exhibits a lower dayside brightness temperature (369 $\pm$ 23 K), and a nightside flux statistically indistinguishable from that of TRAPPIST-1 b ($F_{\rm c, Night, max}$ = $62_{-43}^{+60}$ ppm). Atmosphere models with surface pressures $\geq$1 bar and efficient greenhouse effects are strongly disfavoured for both planets. TRAPPIST-1 b is unlikely to possess any substantial atmosphere, while TRAPPIST-1 c may retain a tenuous, greenhouse-poor O$_2$-dominated atmosphere or be similarly airless with a more reflective surface. These results suggest divergent evolutionary pathways or atmospheric loss processes, despite similar compositions. These measurements tightly constrain atmosphere retention in the inner TRAPPIST-1 system.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2025-09-03*|

|**Abstract**|            The emission-line binary ALS 8814 was recently proposed as a Be star + black hole (BH) binary based on large-amplitude radial velocity (RV) variations of a Be star and non-detection of spectroscopic features from a luminous companion. We reanalyze low- and medium-resolution LAMOST spectra of ALS 8814 and show that the system's spectroscopic variability is considerably more complex than previously recognized. Inspection of the system's trailed spectra reveals the presence of a second set of absorption lines that move in anti-phase with the Be star. In addition, the emission and absorption lines exhibit inconsistent RV variability, suggesting that they trace different stars. Using spectral disentangling, we recover the spectrum of a rapidly rotating companion whose broad, shallow lines were previously undetected. Time-variability in the emission lines complicates interpretation of the disentangled spectrum, such that the physical parameters of the components are still uncertain, but we find with simulations that emission line variability alone is unlikely to explain all signatures of the companion. The system's high Gaia RUWE value suggests a third luminous companion, making ALS 8814 a likely hierarchical triple. Although it is unlikely to contain a BH, the system is unusual, with the largest RV semi-amplitude observed in any known classical Be star and a companion that does not appear to be stripped. More extensive spectroscopic monitoring and high-resolution imaging will be necessary to fully characterize the system's orbital architecture, stellar parameters, and evolutionary status.         |
