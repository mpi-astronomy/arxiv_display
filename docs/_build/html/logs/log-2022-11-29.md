|**Abstract**| Dense stellar environments as hosts of ongoing star formation increase the probability of gravitational encounters among stellar systems during the early stages of evolution. Stellar interaction may occur through non-recurring, hyperbolic or parabolic passages (a so-called 'fly-by'), through secular binary evolution, or through binary capture. In all three scenarios, the strong gravitational perturbation is expected to manifest itself in the disc structures around the individual stars. Here, we present near-infrared polarised light observations that were taken with the SPHERE/IRDIS instrument of three known interacting twin-disc systems: AS 205, EM* SR 24, and FU Orionis. The scattered light exposes spirals likely caused by the gravitational interaction. On a larger scale, we observe connecting filaments between the stars. We analyse their very complex polarised intensity and put particular attention to the presence of multiple light sources in these systems. The local angle of linear polarisation indicates the source whose light dominates the scattering process from the bridging region between the two stars. Further, we show that the polarised intensity from scattering with multiple relevant light sources results from an incoherent summation of the individuals' contribution. This can produce nulls of polarised intensity in an image, as potentially observed in AS 205. We discuss the geometry and content of the systems by comparing the polarised light observations with other data at similar resolution, namely with ALMA continuum and gas emission. Collective observational data can constrain the systems' geometry and stellar trajectories, with the important potential to differentiate between dynamical scenarios of stellar interaction. |

|**Abstract**| [Full abstract in the paper] We aim to better constrain the atmospheric properties of the directly imaged exoplanet 51~Eri~b by using a retrieval approach on higher signal-to-noise data than previously reported. In this context, we also compare the results of using the atmospheric retrieval code \texttt{petitRADTRANS} vs a self-consistent model to fit atmospheric parameters. We present a higher signal-to-noise $YH$ spectrum of the planet and revised $K1K2$ photometry (M$_{K1} = 15.11 \pm 0.04$ mag, M$_{K2} = 17.11 \pm 0.38$ mag). The best-fit parameters obtained using an atmospheric retrieval differ from previous results using self-consistent models. In general, we find that our solutions tend towards cloud-free atmospheres (e.g. log $\tau_{\rm clouds} = -5.20 \pm 1.44$). For our ``nominal'' model with new data, we find a lower metallicity ([Fe/H] $= 0.26\pm$0.30 dex) and C/O ratio ($0.38\pm0.09$), and a slightly higher effective temperature (T$_{\rm{eff}} = 807\pm$45 K) than previous studies. The surface gravity (log $g = 4.05\pm0.37$) is in agreement with the reported values in the literature within uncertainties. We estimate the mass of the planet to be between 2 and 4 M$_{\rm{Jup}}$. When comparing with self-consistent models, we encounter a known correlation between the presence of clouds and the shape of the $P-T$ profiles. Our findings support the idea that results from atmospheric retrievals should not be discussed in isolation, but rather along with self-consistent temperature structures obtained using the retrieval's best-fit parameters. |

|**Abstract**| Over the last two decades, around three hundred quasars have been discovered at $z\gtrsim6$, yet only one was identified as being strong-gravitationally lensed. We explore a new approach, enlarging the permitted spectral parameter space while introducing a new spatial geometry veto criterion, implemented via image-based deep learning. We made the first application of this approach in a systematic search for reionization-era lensed quasars, using data from the Dark Energy Survey, the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy Hemisphere Survey, and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. Our search method consists of two main parts: (i) pre-selection of the candidates based on their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using catalog-level photometry and (ii) relative probabilities calculation of being a lens or some contaminant utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) classification. The training datasets are constructed by painting deflected point-source lights over actual galaxy images to generate realistic galaxy-quasar lens models, optimized to find systems with small image separations, i.e., Einstein radii of $\theta_\mathrm{E} \leq 1$ arcsec. Visual inspection is then performed for sources with CNN scores of $P_\mathrm{lens} > 0.1$, which led us to obtain 36 newly-selected lens candidates, waiting for spectroscopic confirmation. These findings show that automated SED modeling and deep learning pipelines, supported by modest human input, are a promising route for detecting strong lenses from large catalogs that can overcome the veto limitations of primarily dropout-based SED selection approaches. |

|**Abstract**| Although diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) were discovered over 100 years ago, for most of them, their origins are still unknown. Investigation on the correlations between different DIBs is an important way to study the behavior and distributions of their carriers. Based on stacking thousands of spectra from the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey, we study the correlations between two DIBs at 442.8 nm ($\lambda$442.8) and 862.1 nm ($\lambda$862.1), as well as the dust grains, in a range of latitude spanning ${\sim}22^{\circ}$ ($4^{\circ}\,{<}\,|b|\,{<}\,15^{\circ}$) toward the Galactic center ($|\ell|\,{<}\,11^{\circ}$). Tight linear intensity correlations can be found between $\lambda$442.8, $\lambda$862.1, and dust grains for $|b|\,{<}\,12^{\circ}$ or $E(B-V)\,{>}\,0.3$ mag. For $|b|\,{>}\,12^{\circ}$, $\lambda$442.8 and $\lambda$862.1 present larger relative strength with respect to the dust grains. A systematic variation of the relative strength between $\lambda$442.8 and $\lambda$862.1 with $|b|$ and $E(B-V)$ concludes that the two DIBs do not share a common carrier. Furthermore, the carrier of $\lambda$862.1 is more abundant at high latitudes than that of $\lambda$442.8. This work can be treated as an example showing the significance and potentials to the DIB research covering a large latitude range. |

|| <mark>J. Leigh Wojno</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2022-11-29*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted to ApJ*|
|**Abstract**| We present spectroscopic chemical abundances of red giant branch (RGB) stars in Andromeda (M31), using medium resolution ($R\sim6000$) spectra obtained via the Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo (SPLASH) survey. In addition to individual chemical abundances, we coadd low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra of stars to obtain a high enough to measure average [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] abundances. We obtain individual and coadded measurements for [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] for M31 halo stars, covering a range of 9--180 kpc in projected radius from the center of M31. With these measurements, we greatly increase the number of outer halo ($R_{\mathrm{proj}} > 50$ kpc) M31 stars with spectroscopic [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe], adding abundance measurements for 45 individual stars and 33 coadds from a pool of an additional 174 stars. We measure the spectroscopic metallicity ([Fe/H]) gradient, finding a negative radial gradient of $-0.0050\pm0.0003$ for all stars in the halo, consistent with gradient measurements obtained using photometric metallicities. Using the first measurements of [$\alpha$/Fe] for M31 halo stars covering a large range of projected radii, we find a positive gradient ($+0.0026\pm0.0004$) in [$\alpha$/Fe] as a function of projected radius. We also explore the distribution in [Fe/H]--[$\alpha$/Fe] space as a function of projected radius for both individual and coadded measurements in the smooth halo, and compare these measurements to those stars potentially associated with substructure. These spectroscopic abundance distributions highlight the substantial evidence that M31 has had an appreciably different formation and merger history compared to our own Galaxy. |

|**Abstract**| We present the statistical analysis of a subsample of 45 young stars surrounded by protoplanetary disks (PPDs). This is the largest imaging survey uniquely focused on PPDs to date. Our goal is to search for young forming companions embedded in the disk material and to constrain their occurrence rate in relation to the formation mechanism. We used principal component analysis based point spread function subtraction techniques to reveal young companions forming in the disks. We calculated detection limits for our datasets and adopted a black-body model to derive temperature upper limits of potential forming planets. We then used Monte Carlo simulations to constrain the population of forming gas giant companions and compare our results to different types of formation scenarios. Our data revealed a new binary system (HD38120) and a recently identified triple system with a brown dwarf companion orbiting a binary system (HD101412), in addition to 12 known companions. Furthermore, we detected signals from 17 disks, two of which (HD72106 and TCrA) were imaged for the first time. We reached median detection limits of L =15.4 mag at 2.0 arcsec, which were used to investigate the temperature of potentially embedded forming companions. We can constrain the occurrence of forming planets with semi-major axis a in [20 - 500] au and Teff in [600 - 3000] K, in line with the statistical results obtained for more evolved systems from other direct imaging surveys. The NaCo-ISPY data confirm that massive bright planets accreting at high rates are rare. More powerful instruments with better sensitivity in the near- to mid-infrared are likely required to unveil the wealth of forming planets sculpting the observed disk substructures. |

|| <mark>Thomas Mikal-Evans</mark>, et al. -- incl., <mark>Laura Kreidberg</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2022-11-29*|

|**Abstract**| TOI-270d is a temperate sub-Neptune discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) around a bright (J=9.1mag) M3V host star. With an approximate radius of 2RE and equilibrium temperature of 350K, TOI-270d is one of the most promising small exoplanets for atmospheric characterisation using transit spectroscopy. Here we present a primary transit observation of TOI-270d made with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) spectrograph across the 1.126-1.644 micron wavelength range, and a 95% credible upper limit of $8.2 \times 10^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ A$^{-1}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ for the stellar Ly-alpha emission obtained using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The transmission spectrum derived from the TESS and WFC3 data provides evidence for molecular absorption by a hydrogen-rich atmosphere at 4-sigma significance relative to a featureless spectrum. The strongest evidence for any individual absorber is obtained for H2O, which is favoured at 3-sigma significance. When retrieving on the WFC3 data alone and allowing for the possibility of a heterogeneous stellar brightness profile, the detection significance of H2O is reduced to 2.8-sigma. Further observations are therefore required to robustly determine the atmospheric composition of TOI-270d and assess the impact of stellar heterogeneity. If confirmed, our findings would make TOI-270d one of the smallest and coolest exoplanets to date with detected atmospheric spectral features. |

|**Abstract**| Understanding the initial properties of star-forming material and how they affect the star formation process is key. From an observational point of view, the feedback from young high-mass stars on future star formation properties is still poorly constrained. In the framework of the IRAM 30m ORION-B large program, we obtained observations of the translucent and moderately dense gas, which we used to analyze the kinematics over a field of 5 deg^2 around the filamentary structures. We used the ROHSA algorithm to decompose and de-noise the C18O(1-0) and 13CO(1-0) signals by taking the spatial coherence of the emission into account. We produced gas column density and mean velocity maps to estimate the relative orientation of their spatial gradients. We identified three cloud velocity layers at different systemic velocities and extracted the filaments in each velocity layer. The filaments are preferentially located in regions of low centroid velocity gradients. By comparing the relative orientation between the column density and velocity gradients of each layer from the ORION-B observations and synthetic observations from 3D kinematic toy models, we distinguish two types of behavior in the dynamics around filaments: (i) radial flows perpendicular to the filament axis that can be either inflows (increasing the filament mass) or outflows and (ii) longitudinal flows along the filament axis. The former case is seen in the Orion B data, while the latter is not identified. We have also identified asymmetrical flow patterns, usually associated with filaments located at the edge of an HII region. This is the first observational study to highlight feedback from HII regions on filament formation and, thus, on star formation in the Orion B cloud. This simple statistical method can be used for any molecular cloud to obtain coherent information on the kinematics. |

|**Abstract**| PICO is a concept for a NASA probe-scale mission aiming to detect or constrain the tensor to scalar ratio $r$, a parameter that quantifies the amplitude of inflationary gravity waves. We carry out map-based component separation on simulations with five foreground models and input $r$ values $r_{in}=0$ and $r_{in} = 0.003$. We forecast $r$ determinations using a Gaussian likelihood assuming either no delensing or a residual lensing factor $A_{\rm lens}$ = 27%. By implementing the first full-sky, post component-separation, map-domain delensing, we show that PICO should be able to achieve $A_{\rm lens}$ = 22% - 24%. For four of the five foreground models we find that PICO would be able to set the constraints $r < 1.3 \times 10^{-4} \,\, \mbox{to} \,\, r <2.7 \times 10^{-4}\, (95\%)$ if $r_{in}=0$, the strongest constraints of any foreseeable instrument. For these models, $r=0.003$ is recovered with confidence levels between $18\sigma$ and $27\sigma$. We find weaker, and in some cases significantly biased, upper limits when removing few low or high frequency bands. The fifth model gives a $3\sigma$ detection when $r_{in}=0$ and a $3\sigma$ bias with $r_{in} = 0.003$. However, by correlating $r$ determinations from many small 2.5% sky areas with the mission's 555 GHz data we identify and mitigate the bias. This analysis underscores the importance of large sky coverage. We show that when only low multipoles $\ell \leq 12$ are used, the non-Gaussian shape of the true likelihood gives uncertainties that are on average 30% larger than a Gaussian approximation. |

|**Abstract**| Stellar granulation generates fluctuations in photometric and spectroscopic data whose properties depend on the stellar type, composition, and evolutionary state. In this study, we aim to detect the signatures of stellar granulation, link spectroscopic and photometric signatures of convection for main-sequence stars, and test predictions from 3D hydrodynamic models. For the first time, we observed two bright stars (Teff = 5833 K and 6205 K) with high-precision observations taken simultaneously with CHEOPS and ESPRESSO. We analyzed the properties of the stellar granulation signal in each individual data set. We compared them to Kepler observations and 3D hydrodynamic models. While isolating the granulation-induced changes by attenuating the p-mode oscillation signals, we studied the relationship between photometric and spectroscopic observables. The signature of stellar granulation is detected and precisely characterized for the hotter F star in the CHEOPS and ESPRESSO observations. For the cooler G star, we obtain a clear detection in the CHEOPS dataset only. The TESS observations are blind to this stellar signal. Based on CHEOPS observations, we show that the inferred properties of stellar granulation are in agreement with both Kepler observations and hydrodynamic models. Comparing their periodograms, we observe a strong link between spectroscopic and photometric observables. Correlations of this stellar signal in the time domain (flux vs RV) and with specific spectroscopic observables (shape of the cross-correlation functions) are however difficult to isolate due to signal-to-noise dependent variations. In the context of the upcoming PLATO mission and the extreme precision RV surveys, a thorough understanding of the properties of the stellar granulation signal is needed. The CHEOPS and ESPRESSO observations pave the way for detailed analyses of this stellar process. |

|**Abstract**| In this work, we identify elements of effective machine learning datasets in astronomy and present suggestions for their design and creation. Machine learning has become an increasingly important tool for analyzing and understanding the large-scale flood of data in astronomy. To take advantage of these tools, datasets are required for training and testing. However, building machine learning datasets for astronomy can be challenging. Astronomical data is collected from instruments built to explore science questions in a traditional fashion rather than to conduct machine learning. Thus, it is often the case that raw data, or even downstream processed data is not in a form amenable to machine learning. We explore the construction of machine learning datasets and we ask: what elements define effective machine learning datasets? We define effective machine learning datasets in astronomy to be formed with well-defined data points, structure, and metadata. We discuss why these elements are important for astronomical applications and ways to put them in practice. We posit that these qualities not only make the data suitable for machine learning, they also help to foster usable, reusable, and replicable science practices. |

|*Appeared on*| *2022-11-29*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in ApJ*|
|**Abstract**| About the driven mechanisms of the quasi-periodic fast-propagating (QFP) wave trains, there exist two dominant competing physical explanations: associated with the flaring energy release or attributed to the waveguide dispersion. Employing Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 171 A images, we investigated a series of QFP wave trains composed of multiple wavefronts propagating along a loop system during the accompanying flare on 2011 November 11. The wave trains showed a high correlation in start time with the energy release of the accompanying flare. Measurements show that the wave trains phase speed is almost consistent with its group speed with a value of about 1000 km s-1, indicating that the wave trains should not be dispersed waves. The period of the wave trains was the same as that of the oscillatory signal in X ray emissions released by the flare. Thus we propose that the QFP wave trains were most likely triggered by the flare rather than by dispersion. We investigated the seismological application with the QFP waves and then obtained that the magnetic field strength of the waveguide was about 10 Gauss. Meanwhile, we also estimated that the energy flux of the wave trains was about 1.2X105 erg cm-2 s-1. |

|**Abstract**| Although episodic star formation (SF) had been suggested for nearby SF regions, a panoramic view to the latest episodic SF history in the solar neighborhood is still missing. By uniformly constraining the slope $\alpha$ of infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the 13 largest Gould's Belt (GB) protoclusters surveyed by Spitzer Space Telescope, we have constructed a cluster-averaged histogram of $\alpha$ representing YSO evolution lifetime as a function of the $\alpha$ value. Complementary to the traditional SED classification scheme (0, I, F, II, III) that is based on different $\alpha$ values, a staging scheme (A,B,C,D,E) of SED evolution is advised on the basis of the $\alpha$ statistical features that can be better matched to the physical stages of disk dissipation and giant planet formation. This has also allowed us to unravel the fluctuations of star formation rate (SFR) in the past three-million-year (3 Myr) history of these GB protoclusters. Diverse evolutionary patterns such as single peak, double peaks and on-going acceleration of SFR are revealed. The SFR fluctuations are between $20\%\sim60\%$ ($\sim40\%$ on average) and no dependence on the average SFR or the number of SFR episodes is found. However, spatially close protoclusters tend to share similar SFR fluctuation trends, indicating that the driving force of the fluctuations should be at size scales beyond the typical cluster sizes of several parsec. |

|**Abstract**| Spectroastrometry measures source astrometry as a function of wavelength/velocity. Reverberations of spectroastrometric signals naturally arise in broad-line regions (BLRs) of active galactic nuclei as a result of the continuum variations that drive responses of the broad emission lines with time delays. Such signals provide a new diagnostic for mapping BLR kinematics and geometry, complementary to the traditional intensity reverberation mapping (RM) technique. We present the generic mathematical formulism for spectroastrometric RM and show that under realistic parameters of a phenomenological BLR model, the spectroastrometric reverberation signals vary on a level of several to tens of microarcseconds, depending on the BLR size, continuum variability, and angular-size distance. We also derive the analytical expressions of spectroastrometric RM for an inclined ring-like BLR. We develop a Bayesian framework with a sophisticated Monte-Carlo sampling technique to analyze spectroastrometic data and infer the BLR properties, including the central black hole mass and angular-size distance. We demonstrate the potential of spectroastrometric RM in spatially resolving BLR kinematics and geometry through a suite of simulation tests. An application to realistic observation data of 3C~273 obtains tentative, but enlightening results, reinforcing the practical feasibility of conducting spectroastrometric RM experiments on bright AGNs with the operating Very Large Telescope Interferometer as well as possibly with the planned next-generation 30m-class telescopes. |

|**Abstract**| CSS1603+19 is a cataclysmic variable (CV) with an orbital period of 81.96 min, near the minimal period of cataclysmic variables. It is unusual in having a strong mid-infrared excess inconsistent with thermal emission from a brown dwarf companion. Here we present time-resolved multi-wavelength observations of this system. WISE photometry indicates that the mid-infrared excess displays a one-magnitude eclipsing-like variability during the orbit. We obtained near-infrared and optical spectroscopy using Gemini, MDM and APO telescopes. Near-infrared spectra show possible cyclotron features indicating that the white dwarf has a magnetic field of about 5MG. Optical and near-infrared spectra display double-peaked emission lines, with both components showing strong radial velocity variations during the orbital period and with the broad component leading the narrow component stably by about 0.2 of the orbital phase. We construct a physical model informed by existing observations of the system and determine that one component likely originates from the accretion column onto the magnetized white dwarf in synchronous rotation with the orbital motion and the other from the Roche overflow point. This allows us to constrain the masses of the binary components to be $M_1>0.24 M_{\odot}$ for the white dwarf accretor and $M_2=0.0644\pm0.0074 M_\odot$ for the donor. We classify the system as an AM Herculis star, or a polar. It has likely completed its stint on the period gap, but has not yet gone through the period bounce. |

|**Abstract**| We study slow roll single field inflationary scenario and the production of non-thermal fermionic dark matter, together with standard model Higgs, during reheating. For the inflationary scenario, we have considered two models of polynomial potential - one is symmetric about the origin and another one is not. We fix the coefficients of the potential from the current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck/Bicep. Next, we explore the allowed parameter space on the coupling $(y_\chi)$ with inflaton and mass $(m_\chi)$ of dark matter (DM) particles $(\chi)$ produced during reheating and satisfying CMB and several other cosmological constraints. |

|**Abstract**| We examine the HI gas kinematics of galaxy pairs in two clusters and a group using Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) WALLABY pilot survey observations. We compare the HI properties of galaxy pair candidates in the Hydra I and Norma clusters, and the NGC 4636 group, with those of non-paired control galaxies selected in the same fields. We perform HI profile decomposition of the sample galaxies using a tool, {\sc baygaud} which allows us to de-blend a line-of-sight velocity profile with an optimal number of Gaussian components. We construct HI super-profiles of the sample galaxies via stacking of their line profiles after aligning the central velocities. We fit a double Gaussian model to the super-profiles and classify them as kinematically narrow and broad components with respect to their velocity dispersions. Additionally, we investigate the gravitational instability of HI gas disks of the sample galaxies using Toomre Q parameters and HI morphological disturbances. We investigate the effect of the cluster environment on the HI properties of galaxy pairs by dividing the cluster environment into three subcluster regions (i.e., outskirts, infalling and central regions). We find that the denser cluster environment (i.e., infalling and central regions) is likely to impact the HI gas properties of galaxies in a way of decreasing the amplitude of the kinematically narrow HI gas ($M_{\rm{narrow}}^{\rm{HI}}$/$M_{\rm{total}}^{\rm{HI}}$), and increasing the Toomre Q values of the infalling and central galaxies. This tendency is likely to be more enhanced for galaxy pairs in the cluster environment. |

|**Abstract**| The mergers of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) can serve as standard sirens: the gravitational wave (GW) analog of standard candles. The upcoming space-borne GW detectors will be able to discover such systems and estimate their luminosity distances precisely. Unfortunately, weak gravitational lensing can induce significant errors in the measured distance of these standard sirens at high redshift, severely limiting their usefulness as precise distance probes. The uncertainty due to weak lensing can be reduced if the lensing magnification of the siren can be estimated independently, a procedure called 'delensing'. With the help of up-to-date numerical simulations, here we investigate how much the weak-lensing errors can be reduced using convergence maps reconstructed from shear measurements. We also evaluate the impact of delensing on cosmological parameter estimation with bright standard sirens. We find that the weak-lensing errors for sirens at $z_s = 2.9$ can be reduced by about a factor of two on average, but to achieve this would require expensive ultra-deep field observations for every siren. Such an approach is likely to be practical in only limited cases, and the reduction in the weak-lensing error is therefore likely to be insufficient to significantly improve the cosmological parameter estimation. We conclude that performing delensing corrections is unlikely to be worthwhile, in contrast to the more positive expectations presented in previous studies. For delensing to become more practicable and useful in the future will require significant improvements in the resolution/depth of the weak-lensing surveys themselves and/or the accuracy of the methods to reconstruct convergence maps from these surveys. |

|**Abstract**| Fields in cosmology, such as the matter distribution, are observed by experiments up to experimental noise. The first step in cosmological data analysis is usually to de-noise the observed field using an analytic or simulation driven prior. On large enough scales, such fields are Gaussian, and the de-noising step is known as Wiener filtering. However, on smaller scales probed by upcoming experiments, a Gaussian prior is substantially sub-optimal because the true field distribution is very non-Gaussian. Using normalizing flows, it is possible to learn the non-Gaussian prior from simulations (or from more high-resolution observations), and use this knowledge to de-noise the data more effectively. We show that we can train a flow to represent the matter distribution of the universe, and evaluate how much signal-to-noise can be gained as a function of the experimental noise under idealized conditions. We also introduce a patching method to reconstruct fields on arbitrarily large images by dividing them up into small maps (where we reconstruct non-Gaussian features), and patching the small posterior maps together on large scales (where the field is Gaussian). |

|| Bastian Sander, <mark>Gerhard Hensler</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2022-11-29*|
|*Comments*| *14 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**| We numerically investigate the internal evolution of multiphase clouds, which are at rest with respect to an ambient, highly ionized medium (HIM) representing the hot component of the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Time-dependent saturated thermal conduction and its implications like condensation rates and mixing efficiency are assessed in multiphase clouds. Our simulations are carried out by using the adaptive mesh refinement code Flash. We perform a grid of models of which we present here those characteristic for the presented study. The model clouds are initially in both hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium and are in pressure balance with the HIM. Thus, they have steep gradients in both temperature and density at the interface to HIM leading to non-negligible thermal conduction. Several physical processes are considered numerically or semi-analytically: thermal conduction, radiative cooling and external heating of gas, self-gravity, mass diffusion, and dissociation of molecules and ionization of atoms. It turns out that saturated thermal conduction triggers a continuous condensation irrespective of cloud mass. Dynamical interactions with ambient HIM all relate to the radial density gradient in the clouds: (1) mass flux due to condensation is the higher the more homogeneous the clouds are; (2) mixing of condensed gas with cloud gas is easier in low-mass clouds, because of their shallower radial density gradient; thus (3) accreted gas is distributed more efficiently. A distinct and sub-structured transition zone forms at the interface between cloud and HIM, which starts at smaller radii and is much narrower as deduced from analytical theory. |

|**Abstract**| Aims The possible influence of solar superflares on the near-Earth space radiation environment are assessed through the investigation of scaling laws between the peak proton flux and fluence of Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events with the solar flare soft X-ray peak photon flux. Methods We compiled a catalog of 65 well-connected (W20-90) SEP events during the last three solar cycles covering a period of $\sim$34 years (1984-2020) that were associated with flares of class $\geq$C6.0 and investigated the statistical relations between the recorded peak proton fluxes ($I_{P}$) and the fluences ($F_{P}$) at a set of integral energies from E $>$10; $>$30; $>$60; to $>$100 MeV versus the associated solar flare peak soft X-ray flux in the 1$-$8 A band ($F_{SXR}$). Based on the inferred relations, we calculate the integrated energy dependence of the peak proton flux ($I_{P}$) and fluence ($F_{P}$) of the SEP events, assuming that they follow an inverse power-law with respect to energy. Finally, we make use of simple physical assumptions, combining our derived scaling laws, and estimate the upper limits for $I_{P}$ and $F_{P}$ focusing on the flare associated with the strongest GLE yet directly observed (GLE 05 on 23 February 1956), and that inferred for the cosmogenic radionuclide based SEP event of AD774/775. Results We show that $I_{P}$ and $F_{P}$ scale with the solar flare SXR flux as $\propto$~$F_{SXR}^{5/6}$. For the AD774/775 event (with a re-scaled upper limit $F_{SXR}$ = X600) these scaling laws yield values of $F_{P}$ at E$>$200 MeV of $\sim$10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $\sim$1.5 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ cm$^{-2}$ at E$>$430 MeV that are consistent with values inferred from the measurements of $^{14}$C and $^{10}$Be. |

|**Abstract**| The acceleration and transport of energetic electrons during solar flares is one of the outstanding topics in solar physics. Recent X-ray and radio imaging and spectroscopy observations have provided diagnostics of the distribution of nonthermal electrons and suggested that, in certain flare events, electrons are primarily accelerated in the loop-top and likely experience trapping and/or scattering effects. By combining the focused particle transport equation with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of solar flares, we present a macroscopic particle model that naturally incorporates electron acceleration and transport. Our simulation results indicate that the physical processes such as turbulent pitch-angle scattering can have important impacts on both electron acceleration in the loop-top and transport in the flare loop, and their influences are highly energy dependent. A spatial-dependent turbulent scattering with enhancement in the loop-top can enable both efficient electron acceleration to high energies and transport of abundant electrons to the footpoints. We further generate spatially resolved synthetic hard X-ray (HXR) emission images and spectra, revealing both the loop-top and footpoint HXR sources. Similar to the observations, we show that the footpoint HXR sources are brighter and harder than the loop-top HXR source. We suggest that the macroscopic particle model provides new insights into understanding the connection between the observed loop-top and footpoint nonthermal emission sources by combining the particle model with dynamically evolving MHD simulations of solar flares. |

|**Abstract**| Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is an endemic problem in radio astronomy. Information in contaminated frequency channels is lost and it can lead to significant systematic error if not properly modelled. In this paper we propose a RFI mitigation methodology that takes a Bayesian approach, where contaminated data is both flagged and managed as part of a single step fitting process. To the authors knowledge, our approach is first-of-its-kind. We provide a proof-of-concept of our methods which are also tested and shown to be effective on both a simple toy model and when incorporated into the Bayesian data analysis pipeline for REACH (a modern cosmological radio experiment). |

|**Abstract**| Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) is a pair of microsatellites (i.e. GECAM-A and GECAM-B) dedicated to monitoring gamma-ray transients including gravitational waves high-energy electromagnetic counterparts, Gamma-ray Bursts, Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters, Solar Flares and Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes. Since launch in December 2020, GECAM-B has detected hundreds of astronomical and terrestrial events. For these bursts, localization is the key for burst identification and classification as well as follow-up observations in multi-wavelength. Here, we propose a Bayesian localization method with Poisson data with Gaussian background profile likelihood to localize GECAM bursts based on the burst counts distribution in detectors with different orientations. We demonstrate that this method can work well for all kinds of bursts, especially for extremely short ones. In addition, we propose a new method to estimate the systematic error of localization based on a confidence level test, which can overcome some problems of the existing method in literature. We validate this method by Monte Carlo simulations, and then apply it to a burst sample with accurate location and find that the mean value of the systematic error of GECAM-B localization is $\sim 2.5^{\circ}$. By considering this systematic error, we can obtain a reliable localization probability map for GECAM bursts. Our methods can be applied to other gamma-ray monitors. |

|**Abstract**| Bar formation in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation remains challenging. It was previously shown that the fraction of barred galaxies at low stellar masses ($M_*<10^{10.5} M_\odot$) in TNG50 is too low compared to observations. Here, we highlight another tension, also observed at higher stellar masses, namely that barred galaxies in TNG50 appear to be maximal disks, in the sense that the majority of the gravitational acceleration is accounted for by baryons at the peak radius of the baryonic rotation curve, while observations account for a substantial fraction of barred submaximal disks. In this letter, we compare the barred fraction of submaximal disks in the local Universe from the SPARC catalogue with that in the TNG50 simulation. We show that, although SPARC tends to select against barred galaxies, the fraction of barred submaximal disks in this dataset is significantly larger than in TNG50. This result adds to the list of challenges related to predicting the right statistics and properties of barred galaxies in $\Lambda$CDM simulations of galaxy formation. |

|**Abstract**| Filaments have been studied in detail through observations and simulations. A range of numerical works have separately investigated how chemistry and diffusion effects, as well as magnetic fields and their structure impact the gas dynamics of the filament. However, non-ideal effects have hardly been explored thus far. We investigate how non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects, combined with a simplified chemical model affect the evolution and accretion of a star-forming filament. We modeled an accreting self-gravitating turbulent filament using lemongrab, a one-dimensional (1D) non-ideal MHD code that includes chemistry. We explore the influence of non-ideal MHD, the orientation and strength of the magnetic field, and the cosmic ray ionization rate, on the evolution of the filament, with particular focus on the width and accretion rate. We find that the filament width and the accretion rate are determined by the magnetic field properties, including the initial strength, the coupling with the gas controlled by the cosmic ray ionization rate, and the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the accretion flow direction. Increasing the cosmic-ray ionization rate leads to a behavior closer to that of ideal MHD, reducing the magnetic pressure support and, hence, damping the accretion efficiency with a consequent broadening of the filament width. For the same reason, we obtained a narrower width and a larger accretion rate when we reduced the initial magnetic field strength. Overall, while these factors affect the final results by approximately a factor of~2, removing the non-ideal MHD effects results in a much greater variation (up to a factor of~7). The inclusion of non-ideal MHD effects and the cosmic-ray ionization is crucial for the study of self-gravitating filaments and in determining critical observable quantities, such as the filament width and accretion rate. |

|**Abstract**| FIREBall-2 is a stratospheric balloon-borne 1-m telescope coupled to a UV multi-object slit spectrograph designed to map the faint UV emission surrounding z~0.7 galaxies and quasars through their Lyman-alpha line emission. This spectro-imager had its first launch on September 22nd 2018 out of Ft. Sumner, NM, USA. Because the balloon was punctured, the flight was abruptly interrupted. Instead of the nominal 8 hours above 32 km altitude, the instrument could only perform science acquisition for 45 minutes at this altitude. In addition, the shape of the deflated balloon, combined with a full Moon, revealed a severe off-axis scattered light path, directly into the UV science detector and about 100 times larger than expected. In preparation for the next flight, and in addition to describing FIREBall-2's upgrade, this paper discusses the exposure time calculator (ETC) that has been designed to analyze the instrument's optimal performance (explore the instrument's limitations and subtle trade-offs). |

|**Abstract**| The existence of high-redshift supermassive black holes (SMBHs) -- shining brightly as quasars during the first billion years of our universe -- presents a conundrum in astrophysics. A broad variety of physical mechanisms have been proposed for the formation and rapid growth of these early SMBHs. Promising diagnostics are the relative properties of the black hole and its host galaxy. However, up to now, the detection of stars in quasar host galaxies has been elusive beyond $z>2$, even with deep HST observations. Here, we report the first detections of the stellar component of the host galaxies of two relatively low-luminosity quasars at $z>6$ observed with JWST using NIRCam. After modeling and subtracting the glare from the quasar itself, we find that the host galaxies are massive (stellar mass of $2.5\times$ and $6.3\times10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$), compact, and disk-like. Unlike most SMBHs in the nearby universe, these quasars are displaced from the centers of their host galaxies in the rest-frame optical, in one case by $0.9$ kpc. These first positive detections of quasar hosts at $z>6$ are a pivotal milestone; we can now assess the stellar environment along with star formation and black hole accretion to determine the physical conditions that govern the formation and evolution of the first SMBHs. |
