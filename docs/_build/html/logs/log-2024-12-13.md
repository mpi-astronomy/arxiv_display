|**Abstract**|            Optically dark dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) play an essential role in massive galaxy formation at early cosmic time, however their nature remains elusive. Here we present a detailed case study of all the baryonic components of a $z=4.821$ DSFG, XS55. Selected from the ultra-deep COSMOS-XS 3GHz map with a red SCUBA-2 450$\mu$m/850$\mu$m colour, XS55 was followed up with ALMA 3mm line scans and spectroscopically confirmed to be at $z=4.821$ via detections of the CO(5-4) and [CI](1-0) lines. JWST/NIRCam imaging reveals that XS55 is a F150W-dropout with red F277W/F444W colour, and a complex morphology: a compact central component embedded in an extended structure with a likely companion. XS55 is tentatively detected in X-rays with both Chandra and XMM-Newton, suggesting an active galactic nucleus (AGN) nature. By fitting a panchromatic SED spanning NIR to radio wavelengths, we revealed that XS55 is a massive main-sequence galaxy with a stellar mass of $M_\ast=(5\pm1)\times10^{10}\,{\rm M_\odot}$ and a star formation rate of ${\rm SFR}=540\pm177~{\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$. The dust of XS55 is optically thick in the far infrared (FIR) with a surprisingly cold dust temperature of $T_{\rm dust}=33\pm2\,{\rm K}$, making XS55 one of the coldest DSFGs at $z>4$ known to date. This work unveils the nature of a radio-selected F150W-dropout, suggesting the existence of a population of DSFGs hosting active black holes embedded in optically thick dust.         |

|**Abstract**|            EL CVn-type systems represent a rare evolutionary stage in binary star evolution, providing ideal laboratories for investigating stable mass transfer processes and the formation of extremely low-mass white dwarfs (ELM WDs). The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has delivered an extensive collection of high-precision time-domain photometric data, which is invaluable for studying EL CVn binaries. In this study, we identified 29 EL CVn systems from the TESS eclipsing binary catalogs (sectors 1-65), 11 of which are newly discovered. These systems consist of smaller, hotter pre-He white dwarfs and A/F main-sequence stars. The orbital periods of these binaries range from 0.64 to 2.5 days. Utilizing TESS light curves, Gaia distances, and multi-band photometric data (e.g., GALEX, 2MASS, WISE, SkyMapper), we modeled the light curves and spectral energy distributions to derive system parameters, including effective temperatures, masses, and radii. These systems were then compared with the white dwarf mass-period relation and the evolutionary tracks of ELM WDs. The comparison reveals that these binaries are consistent with the expected mass-period relation for white dwarfs and align well with the evolutionary tracks on the Teff-logg diagram for ELM WDs. This result suggests that these EL CVn systems likely formed through stable mass transfer processes. We provide a catalog of complete parameters for 29 EL CVn systems identified from the TESS survey. This catalog will serve as an essential resource for studying binary mass transfer, white dwarf formation, and pulsation phenomena in EL CVn-type systems.         |

|**Abstract**|            Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) represent a recently identified class of pulsating stars distinguished by their short pulsation periods (22-40 minutes) and asymmetric light curves. This study investigates the evolutionary channel of HD 133729, the first confirmed BLAP in a binary system. Through binary evolution simulations with MESA, we explored various mass ratios and initial orbital periods, finding that a mass ratio of q = 0.30 coupled with non-conservative mass transfer ($\rm \beta$ = 0.15) successfully reproduces the observational characteristics (including luminosity, surface gravity, and effective temperature) of the binary system. Our models not only match the observed pulsational properties but also predict significant helium and nitrogen enhancements on the surface of the main-sequence companion. The system is expected to eventually undergo a common envelope phase leading to a stellar merger. Our findings provide crucial insights into the formation mechanism and evolutionary fate of BLAPs with main-sequence companions, while also placing constraints on the elemental abundances of their binary companions.         |

|| C. Yang, <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-12-13*|
|*Comments*| *10 pages, 2 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a major candidate for dark matter and they have been extensively constrained across most mass ranges. However, PBHs in the mass range of $10^{17}-10^{21}$ g remain a viable explanation for all dark matter. In this work, we use observational data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) to refine constraints on PBHs within the mass range of $10^{16}-10^{18}$ g. Our analysis explores three scenarios: directly using observational data, incorporating the astrophysical background model (ABM), and employing the power-law spectrum with an exponential cutoff. Additionally, we also account for photon flux from positron annihilation due to Hawking radiation in our calculations. Our findings indicate that directly using observational data significantly tightens constraints on PBHs with masses above $10^{17}$ g, owing to Insight-HXMT's exceptional sensitivity to hard X-rays. Incorporating the ABM further enhances the constraints by approximately 0.8 orders of magnitude. The exclusion limit for PBHs as dark matter extends to $8\times 10^{17}$ g, nearly doubling the current threshold. Moreover, extrapolating the energy limit with a power-law model improves constraints by approximately one order of magnitude compared to the ABM scenario.         |

|**Abstract**|            A complete understanding of the initial conditions of high-mass star formation and what processes determine multiplicity require the study of the magnetic field (B-field) in young, massive cores. Using ALMA 250 GHz polarization (0.3" = 1000 au) and ALMA 220 GHz high-angular resolution observations (0.05" = 160 au), we have performed a full energy analysis including the B-field at core scales and have assessed what influences the multiplicity inside a massive core previously believed to be in the prestellar phase. With 31 Msun, the G11.92 MM2 core has a young CS outflow with a dynamical time scale of a few thousand years. At high-resolution, the MM2 core fragments into a binary system with a projected separation of 505 au and a binary mass ratio of 1.14. Using the DCF method with an ADF analysis, we estimate in this core a B-field strength of 6.2 mG and a mass-to-flux ratio of 18. The MM2 core is strongly subvirialized with a virial parameter of 0.064, including the B-field. The high mass-to-flux ratio and low virial parameter indicate that this massive core is very likely undergoing runaway collapse, which is in direct contradiction with the core-accretion model. The MM2 core is embedded in a filament that has a velocity gradient consistent with infall. In line with clump-fed scenarios, the core can grow in mass at a rate of 1.9--5.6 x 10^-4 Msun/yr. In spite of the B-field having only a minor contribution to the total energy budget at core scales, it likely plays a more important role at smaller scales by setting the binary properties. Considering energy ratios and a fragmentation criterion at the core scale, the binary could have been formed by core fragmentation. The binary properties (separation and mass ratio), however, are also consistent with radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations with super-Alfvenic, supersonic (or sonic) turbulence that form binaries by disk fragmentation.         |
