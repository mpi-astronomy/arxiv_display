|**Abstract**|            We present polarization maps of dust emission at 340 GHz in the luminous high-mass protocluster, W3 IRS5, observed with the Submillimeter Array. The projected magnetic fields appear fairly organized with a pinched morphology in the northern part and a concave shape in the southern part. We fit the polarization maps with a two-component magnetic field model: an hourglass model centered at the continuum peak, SMM2, and an empirical sphere centered at the O-type star, IRS7. Using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we calculate a projected field strength of $B_\mathrm{pos} = 1.4 \; \mathrm{mG}$. Along with the Zeeman measurement, a total magnetic field strength of $B_\mathrm{tot} = 1.6 \; \mathrm{mG}$ is obtained. We find that the gravitational energy is the most dominant, followed by magnetic energy, and then turbulent energy. Small values of the virial parameter, $\alpha_\mathrm{vir} = 0.8$, and the ratio of timescales, $t_\mathrm{ff}/t_\mathrm{corss} = 0.6$, suggest an ongoing collapse. We also show collimated molecular outflows in the $\mathrm{CO \; (3-2)}$ and $\mathrm{SiO \; (8-7)}$ transitions. The morphology of magnetic fields and the surrounding \HII regions put forward a scenario for W3 IRS5. A gravitationally unstable dense core formed within a neutral gas ridge plowed by the expansions of W3 A and W3 B. The core began to contract, causing gravity to pull the magnetic field lines inward, which resulted in a pinched field morphology. Subsequent expansion of W3 F, ionized by IRS7, perturbed the magnetic field, creating concave patterns. The dynamical interactions among protostars led to misalignment of their outflows.         |

|**Abstract**|            Starburst galaxies, like M82, launch kiloparsec-scale galactic outflows that interact with the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in complex ways. Apart from enriching the CGM with metals and energy, these outflows may trigger star formation in the halo -- either by driving shocks into the CGM or transporting cold, star-forming gas. To investigate such processes, we analyze the star formation history (SFH) of the Southern Arcs -- arc-like stellar features located ~5 kpc from M82's star-forming disk along the minor axis -- using Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 photometry. From resolved stellar populations, we derive SFHs over the last ~500 Myr, finding that ~85% of the stellar mass formed between ~150 and ~70 Myr ago, followed by a brief pause, with the remaining ~15% forming since ~30 Myr ago. The two stellar populations are co-spatial on scales of at least ~200 pc. The timing of the ~100 Myr burst aligns with star formation in the M82 disk and the age distribution of its star clusters, suggesting a causal link between the disk starburst and halo star formation. We explore two mechanisms that could explain these observations. In the first, shocks driven by the interaction between hot outflowing gas and cooler CGM material compress dense clouds, triggering collapse and star formation. In the second, stars form directly within massive, cool clouds associated with the outflow. As these clouds move ballistically through the halo, subsequent interactions with tidal debris may trigger additional star formation, producing the observed episodic structure.         |

|| J. Nie, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) presents significant potential for high-precision astrometry. In this study, we show that the point spread function (PSF) modeled by the discrete PSF with Multi-Gaussian function can effectively enhance the astrometric accuracy. We determine that the PSF profile can be accurately modeled by three Gaussians, which takes advantage of reduced computational complexity in PSF convolution. In sparse star fields, the lowest centering accuracy we obtain after aberration correction can be below 1 mas. We find that the proper motion errors remain below 1.0 mas/yr for point sources with five observations and approximately 0.8 mas/yr for seven observations with a time baseline of around 3.5 years. We finally demonstrate that the precision of our position measurements for stars fainter than 21 mag in the simulated CSST crowded field is better than the results from both SExtractor and DOLPHOT.         |
