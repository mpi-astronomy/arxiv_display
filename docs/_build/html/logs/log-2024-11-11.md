|**Abstract**|            The inner regions of protoplanetary disks are prone to thermal instability (TI), which can significantly impact the thermal and dynamic evolution of planet-forming regions. Observable as episodic accretion outbursts, such periodic disturbances shape the disk's vertical and radial structure. We investigate the stability of the inner disk edge around a Class II T Tauri star and analyse the consequences of TI on the inner disk's evolution in both the vertical and radial dimensions. A particular focus is laid on the emergence and destruction of solid-trapping pressure maxima. Our 2D axisymmetric radiation hydrodynamic models include the transition to the dead zone from a highly turbulent inner disk, heating by both stellar irradiation and viscous dissipation, vertical and radial radiative transport and an adaptive dust-to-gas mass ratio. The simulated time frames include both the TI- and quiescent phases. We track the TI on S-curves of thermal stability. The TI in our models can develop in disks with moderate accretion rates and results from the activation of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in the dead zone. The TI creates an extensive MRI active region around the midplane and disrupts the stable pebble- and migration trap at the inner edge of the dead zone. Our simulations consistently show the occurrence of TI-reflares, which, together with the initial TI, produce pressure maxima in the inner disk within 1 AU, possibly providing favourable conditions for streaming instability. On a timescale of a few thousand years, TI regularly disrupts the disk's radial and vertical structure within 1 AU. While several pressure maxima are created, stable migration traps are destroyed and reinstated after the TI phase. Our models provide a foundation for more detailed investigations into phenomena such as short-term variability of accretion rates.         |
