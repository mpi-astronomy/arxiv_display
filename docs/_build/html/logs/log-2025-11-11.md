|**Abstract**|            In this manuscript, we recheck the spectroscopic properties of SDSS J134733.36+121724.27 (4C+12.50), confirming the presence of the double-peaked [O~{\sc iii}]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$Å doublet and a broad H$\alpha$. The former likely results from AGN-driven biconical outflows, while the absence of a broad H$\beta$ supports a classification of the source as a Type-1.9 AGN. We analyze its high-quality Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) optical spectrum after robustly subtracting host galaxy and AGN continuum contributions through a simple stellar population fitting method employing 39 templates and a power-law continuum. Each narrow line of the [O~{\sc iii}]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$Å doublet is better described by two Gaussian components (blue-shifted and red-shifted) than by a single Gaussian, as confirmed by the F-test. Broad components are included for both H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, but only H$\alpha$ reveals a significant detection, further supported by a comparison between the SDSS spectrum and that previously reported. These results support that the object is highly consistent with a Type-1.9 AGN classification, and the double-peaked [O~{\sc iii}] profiles are most likely produced by AGN-driven biconical outflows rather than by a rotating narrow-line region or a dual AGN merger system. Additional observations are still needed to strengthen these conclusions.         |

|**Abstract**|            In September 2017, a high-energy neutrino event detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (IceCube-170922A) was associated, at the $3\sigma$ level, with a gamma-ray flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056. Cosmic rays that are accelerated in astrophysical sources can escape from their jets and interact with background radiation fields. Interactions with the extragalactic background light can produce pions and hence neutrinos, while interactions with the cosmic microwave background predominantly drive inverse Compton scattering, contributing to electromagnetic cascades in intergalactic space. The resulting secondary gamma-ray emission can be detected with high-energy gamma-ray telescopes. Here, we report on a new search for such cosmogenic cascade emission from the blazar TXS 0506+056, using a combined data set from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope and VERITAS. We compare the gamma-ray spectrum and neutrino observations with the predictions of cosmic-ray induced cascades in intergalactic space. The observed gamma-ray spectrum is modeled as a combination of the primary spectrum and the cascade spectrum. We apply a Monte Carlo simulation with a $\Delta\chi^2$-based likelihood analysis to jointly determine the best-fit parameters of a proton emission spectrum describing the data and derive constraints on the proton escape luminosity. Assuming a log-parabola primary photon spectrum, we find consistency with a proton injection spectral index of $\alpha_{p} \simeq 2.0$ and a cutoff energy of $E_{p,\text{max}} \simeq 1.3 \times 10^{16}$ eV, and constrain the isotropic proton escape luminosity to $1 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ $\lesssim L_{p, esc} \lesssim 3 \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at the 90 % confidence level.         |

|**Abstract**|            The China Space Station Telescope (CSST), slated to become China's largest space-based optical telescope in the coming decade, is designed to conduct wide-field sky surveys with high spatial resolution. Among its key observational modes, slitless spectral observation allows simultaneous imaging and spectral data acquisition over a wide field of view, offering significant advantages for astrophysical studies. Currently, the CSST is in the development phase and lacks real observational data. As a result, the development of its data processing pipeline and scientific pre-research must rely on the mock data generated through simulations. This work focuses on developing a simulation framework for the CSST slitless spectral imaging system, analyzing its spectral dispersing properties and structural design. Additionally, the detection performance of the slitless spectral system is assessed for various astrophysical targets. Simulation results demonstrate that nearly all 1st order spectra are accompanied by corresponding 0th order images, facilitating accurate source identification. Furthermore, the GI spectral band exhibits superior detection efficiency compared to the GV and GU bands, establishing it as the primary observational band for stellar and galactic studies. This work successfully develops a simulation framework for the CSST slitless spectroscopic equipment.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is a flagship space-based observatory. Its main survey camera is designed to conduct high spatial resolution near-ultraviolet to near-infrared imaging and low-resolution spectroscopic surveys. To maximize the scientific output of CSST, we have developed a comprehensive, high-fidelity simulation pipeline for reproducing both imaging and spectroscopic observations. This paper presents an overview of the simulation framework, detailing its implementation and components. Built upon the GalSim package and incorporating the latest CSST instrumental specifications, our pipeline generates pixel-level mock observations that closely replicate the expected instrumental and observational conditions. The simulation suite integrates realistic astrophysical object catalogs, instrumental effects, point spread function (PSF) modeling, and observational noises to produce accurate synthetic data. We describe the key processing stages of the simulation, from constructing the input object catalogs to modeling the telescope optics and detector responses. Furthermore, we introduce the most recent release of simulated datasets, which provide a crucial testbed for data processing pipeline developments, calibration strategies, and scientific analyses, ensuring that CSST will meet its stringent requirements. Our pipeline serves as a vital tool for optimizing CSST main survey strategies and ensuring robust cosmological measurements.         |
