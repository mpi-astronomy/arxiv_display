|**Abstract**| SPHERE+ is a proposed upgrade of the SPHERE instrument at the VLT, which is intended to boost the current performances of detection and characterization for exoplanets and disks. SPHERE+ will also serve as a demonstrator for the future planet finder (PCS) of the European ELT. The main science drivers for SPHERE+ are 1/ to access the bulk of the young giant planet population down to the snow line ($3-10$ au), to bridge the gap with complementary techniques (radial velocity, astrometry); 2/ to observe fainter and redder targets in the youngest ($1-10$\,Myr) associations compared to those observed with SPHERE to directly study the formation of giant planets in their birth environment; 3/ to improve the level of characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres by increasing the spectral resolution in order to break degeneracies in giant planet atmosphere models. Achieving these objectives requires to increase the bandwidth of the xAO system (from $\sim$1 to 3\,kHz) as well as the sensitivity in the infrared (2 to 3\,mag). These features will be brought by a second stage AO system optimized in the infrared with a pyramid wavefront sensor. As a new science instrument, a medium resolution integral field spectrograph will provide a spectral resolution from 1000 to 5000 in the J and H bands. This paper gives an overview of the science drivers, requirements and key instrumental trade-off that were done for SPHERE+ to reach the final selected baseline concept. |

|**Abstract**| This paper presents the status of an ongoing project aimed at developing a PSF reconstruction software for adaptive optics (AO) observations. In particular, we test for the first time the implementation of pyramid wave-front sensor data on our algorithms. As a first step in assessing its reliability, we applied the software to bright, on-axis, point-like sources using two independent sets of observations, acquired with the single-conjugated AO upgrade for the Large Binocular Telescope. Using only telemetry data, we reconstructed the PSF by carefully calibrating the instrument response. The accuracy of the results has been first evaluated using the classical metric: specifically, the reconstructed PSFs differ from the observed ones by less than 2% in Strehl ratio and 4.5% in full-width at half maximum. Moreover, the recovered encircled energy associated with the PSF core is accurate at 4% level in the worst case. The accuracy of the reconstructed PSFs has then been evaluated by considering an idealized scientific test-case consisting in the measurements of the morphological parameters of a compact galaxy. In the future, our project will include the analysis of anisoplanatism, low SNR regimes, and the application to multi-conjugated AO observations. |

|**Abstract**| During the commissioning of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) observed NGC 6552 with the MIRI Imager and the Medium-Resolution Spectrograph (MRS). NGC 6552 is an active galactic nucleus (AGN) at redshift 0.0266 classified as a Seyfert 2 nucleus in the optical, and Compton-thick AGN in X-rays. This work exemplifies and demonstrates the MRS capabilities to study the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectra and characterize the physical conditions and kinematics of the ionized and molecular gas in the nuclear regions of nearby galaxies. We obtained the nuclear, circumnuclear, and central mid-IR spectra of NGC 6552. They provide the first clear observational evidence for a nuclear outflow in NGC 6552. The outflow contributes to 68$\pm$6% of the total line flux independent of the ionization potential (27 to 187 eV) and critical densities (10$^4$ to 4$\times$10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$), showing an average blue-shifted peak velocity of -126$\pm$44 kms$^{-1}$ and an outflow maximal velocity of 689$\pm$37 kms$^{-1}$. Since the mid-IR photons penetrate dusty regions as efficiently as X-ray keV photons, we interpret these results as the evidence for a highly ionized, non-stratified, AGN-powered, and fast outflowing gas in a low density environment (few 10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$) located very close to the Compton-thick AGN. Nine pure rotational molecular Hydrogen lines are detected and spectrally resolved, and exhibit symmetric Gaussian profiles, consistent with the galactic rotation, and with no evidence of outflowing H$_{2}$ material. We detect a warm H$_{2}$ mass of $1.7\pm1.1\times10^7 M_{\odot}$ in the central region (1.8 kpc in diameter) of the galaxy, with almost 20% of that mass in the circum-nuclear region. Line ratios confirm that NGC 6552 has a Seyfert nucleus with a black hole mass estimated in the range of 0.8 to 8 million solar masses. |

|**Abstract**| In this review paper, we aim at providing a global outlook on the progresses made in the recent years to characterize the role of magnetic fields during the embedded phases of the star formation process. Thanks to the development of observational capabilities and the parallel progress in numerical models capturing most of the important physics at work during star formation, it has recently become possible to confront detailed predictions of magnetized models to observational properties of the youngest protostars. We provide an overview of the most important consequences when adding magnetic fields to state-of-the-art models of protostellar formation, emphasizing their role to shape the resulting star(s) and their disk(s). We discuss the importance of magnetic field coupling to set the efficiency of magnetic processes, and provide a review of observational works putting constraints on the two main agents responsible for the coupling in star-forming cores: dust grains and ionized gas. We recall the physical processes and observational methods allowing to trace the magnetic field topology and its intensity in embedded protostars, and review the main steps, success and limitations in comparing real observations to synthetic observations from the non-ideal MHD models. Finally, we discuss the main threads of observational evidence that suggest a key role of magnetic fields for star and disk formation, and propose a scenario solving the angular momentum for star formation, also highlighting the remaining tensions that exist between models and observations. |

|**Abstract**| Ground-based high-resolution spectrographs are key instruments for several astrophysical domains. Unfortunately, the observed spectra are contaminated by the Earth's atmosphere. While different techniques exist to correct for telluric lines in exoplanet atmospheric studies, in radial velocity (RV) studies, telluric lines with an absorption depth of >2% are generally masked, which poses a problem for faint targets and M dwarfs as most of their RV content is present where telluric contamination is important. We propose a simple telluric model to be embedded in the ESPRESSO DRS. The goal is to provide telluric-free spectra and enable RV measurements, including spectral ranges where telluric lines fall. The model is a line-by-line radiative transfer code that assumes a single atmospheric layer. We use the sky conditions and the physical properties of the lines from HITRAN to create the telluric spectrum. A subset of selected telluric lines is used to robustly fit the spectrum through a Levenberg-Marquardt minimization algorithm. When applied to stellar spectra from A0- to M5-type stars, the residuals of the strongest H2O lines are below 2% for all spectral types, with the exception of M dwarfs, which are within the pseudo-continuum. We then determined the RVs from the telluric-corrected ESPRESSO spectra of Tau Ceti and Proxima. We created telluric-free masks and compared the obtained RVs with the DRS RVs. In the case of Tau Ceti, we identified that micro-telluric lines introduce systematics up to an amplitude of 58 cm/s and with a period of one year. For Proxima, the gain in spectral content at redder wavelengths is equivalent to a gain of 25% in photon noise. This leads to better constraints on the semi-amplitude and eccentricity of Proxima d. We showcase that our model can be applied to other molecules, and thus to other wavelength regions observed by other spectrographs, such as NIRPS. |

|| <mark>Yiran Zhang</mark>, Siming Liu, Dejin Wu |
|*Appeared on*| *2022-09-07*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted by ApJ*|
|**Abstract**| Under nonuniform convection, the distribution of diffusive particles can exhibit dipole and quadrupole anisotropy induced by the fluid inertial and shear force, respectively. These convection-related anisotropies, unlike the Compton-Getting effect, typically increase with the cosmic-ray (CR) energy, and are thus candidate contributors for the CR anisotropy. In consideration of the inertial effect, CR observational data can be used to set an upper limit on the average acceleration of the local interstellar medium in the equatorial plane to be on the order of 100 $ \mu \text{m}/\text{s}^2 $. Using Oort constants, the quadrupole anisotropy above 200 TeV may be modeled with the shear effect arising from the Galactic differential rotation. |

|**Abstract**| We prepared a sample of mono-deuterated oxirane and studied its rotational spectrum in the laboratory between 490 GHz and 1060 GHz in order to improve its spectroscopic parameters and consequently the calculated rest frequencies of its rotational transitions. The updated rest frequencies were employed to detect $c$-C$_2$H$_3$DO for the first time in the interstellar medium in the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS) of the Class 0 protostellar system IRAS 16293$-$2422. Fits of the detected lines using the rotation diagrams yield a temperature of $T_{\rm rot} = 103 \pm 19$ K, which in turn agrees well with 125 K derived for the $c$-C$_2$H$_4$O main isotopologue previously. The $c$-C$_2$H$_3$DO to $c$-C$_2$H$_4$O ratio is found to be $\sim$0.15 corresponding to a D-to-H ratio of $\sim$0.036 per H atom which is slightly higher than the D-to-H ratio of species such as methanol, formaldehyde, ketene and but lower than those of the larger complex organic species such as ethanol, methylformate and glycolaldehyde. This may reflect that oxirane is formed fairly early in the evolution of the prestellar cores. The identification of doubly deuterated oxirane isotopomers in the PILS data may be possible judged by the amount of mono-deuterated oxirane and the observed trend that multiply deuterated isotopologues have higher deuteration rates than their mono-deuterated variants. |

|**Abstract**| Molecular clouds are sites of star formation. Magnetic fields are believed to play an important role in their dynamics and shaping morphology. We aim to study any possible correlation that might exist between the magnetic fields orientation inside the clouds and the magnetic fields at envelope scales and their connection with respect to the observed morphology of the selected clouds. We examine the magnetic field orientation towards the clouds L1512, L1523, L1333, L1521E, L1544, L1517, L1780, and L183 using optical and \textit{Planck} polarization observations. We also found the correlation between the ambient magnetic field and core orientations derived using \textit{Astrodendrogram} on the \textit{Herschel} 250 $\mu$m data. We find that the magnetic fields derived from optical and \textit{Planck} agree with each other. The derived magnetic fields are aligned along the observed emission of each cloud as seen in \textit{Herschel} 250 $\mu$m data. We also find that the relative orientation between the cores and the magnetic fields is random. This lack of correlation may arise due to the fact that the core orientation could also be influenced by the different magnetization within individual clouds at higher densities or the feedback effects which may vary from cloud to cloud. The estimated magnetic field strength and the mass-to-flux ratio suggest that all the clouds are in a magnetically critical state except L1333, L1521E, and L183 where the cloud envelope could be strongly supported by the magnetic field lines. |

|**Abstract**| Tidal ring galaxies are observed rarely in the local universe due to their intrinsically transient nature. The tidal ring structures are the result of strong interactions between gas-rich stellar disks and smaller galactic systems and do not last longer than ~500~Myr therefore, these are perfect scenarios where to find the debris of recently accreted dwarf galactic systems. We present new deep images of the NGC 922 tidal ring galaxy and its surroundings from the DESI Legacy survey data and from our observations with an amateur telescope. These observations are compared with results from high-resolution N-body simulations designed to reproduce an alternative formation scenario for this peculiar galaxy. Our new observations unveil that the low surface brightness stellar tidal structures around NGC 922 are much more complex than reported in previous works. In particular, the formerly detected tidal spike-like structure at the northeast of the central galaxy disk is not connected with the dwarf companion galaxy PGC3080368, which has been suggested as the intruder triggering the ring formation of NGC 922. The deep images reveal that this tidal structure is mainly composed by a fainter giant umbrella-like shape and thus it was formed from the tidal disruption of a different satellite. Using the broad-band g, r and z DESI LS images, we measured the photometric properties of this stellar stream, estimating a total absolute magnitude in r-band of Mr= -17.0 +/- 0.03 magn and a total stellar mass for the stream between 6.9-8.5X10^8 Mo. We perform a set of N-body simulations to reproduce the observed NGC 922-intruder interaction, suggesting a new scenario for the formation of its tidal ring from the in-fall of a gas rich satellite around 150 Myr ago. |

|**Abstract**| We present our velocity measurements of 59 clumpy, metal-rich ejecta knots in the supernova remnant (SNR) of SN 1572 (Tycho). We use our 450 ks Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer observation to measure the Doppler shift of the He-like Si K$\alpha$ line-center wavelength emitted from these knots to find their line-of-sight (radial) velocities ($v_r$). We find $v_r$ up to $\sim$ 5500 km s$^{-1}$, with roughly consistent speeds between blueshifted and redshifted ejecta knots. We also measure the proper motions (PMs) for our sample based on archival Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer data taken from 2003, 2009, and 2015. We estimate PMs up to 0$"$.35 yr$^{-1}$, which corresponds to a transverse velocity of about 5800 km s$^{-1}$ for the distance of 3.5 kpc to Tycho. Our $v_r$ and transverse velocity measurements imply space velocities of $\sim$ 1900 - 6000 km s$^{-1}$ for the ejecta knots in Tycho. We estimate a new expansion center of R.A.(J2000) = 00$^h$25$^m$18$^s$.725 $\pm$ 1$^s$.157 and decl.(J2000) = +64$^{\circ}$08$'$02$"$.5 $\pm$ 11$"$.2 from our PM measurements, consistent to within $\sim$ 13$"$ of the geometric center. The distribution of space velocities throughout the remnant suggests that the southeast quadrant generally expands faster than the rest of the SNR. We find that blueshifted knots are projected more in the northern shell, while redshifted knots are more in the southern shell. The previously estimated reverse shock position is consistent with most of our estimated ejecta distribution, however some ejecta show deviations from the 1-D picture of the reverse shock. |

|**Abstract**| Context. The Magellanic Clouds are our nearest star-forming galaxies. While the population of high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is relatively well studied, our knowledge about the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is far from complete given its large angular extent and insufficient coverage with X-ray observations. Aims. We conducted a search for new HMXBs in the LMC using data from eROSITA, the soft X-ray instrument on board the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) satellite. Methods. After confirming the nature of eRASSU J052914.9-662446 as a hard X-ray source positionally coincident with an early type star, we followed it up with optical spectroscopic observations from South African Large Telescope (SALT) and a dedicated NuSTAR observation. Results. We study the broadband timing and spectral behaviour of the newly discovered HMXB eRASSU J052914.9-662446 through eROSITA, Swift and NuSTAR data in X-rays and the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) and SALT RSS data at optical wavelength. We report on detection of the spin period at 1412 s and suggest an orbital period of the system of ~151 days, and thereby establish eRASSU J052914.9-662446 as an accreting pulsar. Further, through optical spectroscopic observations and the existence of H alpha emission the source is identified as a Be X-ray binary pulsar in the LMC. We also investigate the variability of the source in the optical and X-ray regime over the last decades and provide estimates on the possible magnetic field strength of the neutron star. |

|| <mark>Masaki Ueda</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2022-09-07*|
|*Comments*| *20 pages, 16 figures, Accepted for publication in PASJ*|
|**Abstract**| We present measurements of the soft X-ray background emission for 130 Suzaku observations at $75^\circ<l < 285^\circ$ and $|b|>15^\circ$ obtained from 2005 to 2015, covering nearly one solar cycle. In addition to the standard soft X-ray background model consisting of the local hot bubble and the Milky Way Halo (MWH), we include a hot collisional-ionization-equilibrium component with a temperature of $\sim 0.8$ keV to reproduce spectra of a significant fraction of the lines of sight. Then, the scatter in the relation between the emission measure vs. temperature of the MWH component is reduced. Here, we exclude time ranges with high count rates to minimize the effect of the solar wind charge exchange (SWCX). However, the spectra of almost the same lines of sight are inconsistent. The heliospheric SWCX emissions likely contaminate and gives a bias in measurements of temperature and the emission measure of the MWH. Excluding the data around the solar maximum and using the data taken before the end of 2009, at $|b|>35^\circ$ and $105^\circ<l<255^\circ$, the temperature (0.22 keV) and emission measure ($2\times 10^{-3}~\rm{cm^{-6}pc}$) of the MWH are fairly uniform. The increase of the emission measure toward the lower Galactic latitude at $|b|<35^\circ$ indicates a presence of a disk-like morphology component. A composite model which consists of disk-like and spherical-morphology components also reproduces the observed emission measure distribution of MWH. In this case, the hydrostatic mass at a few tens of kpc from the Galactic center agrees with the gravitational mass of the Milky Way. The plasma with the virial temperature likely fills the Milky Way halo in nearly hydrostatic equilibrium. Assuming the gas metallicity of 0.3 solar, the upper limit of the gas mass of the spherical component out to 250 kpc, or the virial radius, is $\sim$ a few $\times 10^{10}~ M_\odot$. |

|**Abstract**| Exploring the Galactic chemical evolution and enrichment scenarios with open clusters allows us to understand the history of the Milky Way disk. High-resolution spectra of OCs are a crucial tool, as they provide precise chemical information, to combine with precise distances and ages. The aim of the Stellar Population Astrophysics project is to derive homogeneous and accurate comprehensive chemical characterization of a number of poorly studied OCs.Using the HARPS-N echelle spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, we obtained high-resolution spectra of giant stars in 18 OCs, 16 of which are chemically characterized for the first time, and two of which are well studied for comparison. The OCs in this sample have ages from a few tens of Myr to 4 Gyr, with a prevalence of young clusters. We already presented the radial velocities and atmospheric parameters for them in a previous SPA paper. Here, we present results for the alpha-elements O, and the light elements, all determined by the equivalent width method. We also measured Li abundance through the synthesis method.We discuss the behaviors of lithium, sodium and aluminum in the context of stellar evolution. We study the radial, vertical, and age trends for the measured abundance ratios in a sample that combines our results and recent literature for OCs, finding significant gradients only for [Mg/Fe] and [Ca/Fe] in all cases. Finally,we compare O and Mg in the combined sample with chemo-dynamical models, finding a good agreement for intermediate-age and old clusters. There is a sharp increase in the abundance ratios measured among very young clusters, accompanied by a poorer fit with the models for O and Mg, likely related to the inadequacy of traditional model atmospheres and methods in the derivation of atmospheric parameters and abundance ratios for stars of such young ages |

|*Comments*| *15 pages, 7 figures, to be submitted to ApJ*|
|**Abstract**| I report on validation and testing of a novel 3D reconstruction method than can obtain coronal plasma properties from a single snapshot perspective. I first reported on the method in 2021, and I have since named it the Coronal Reconstruction Onto B-Aligned Regions, or 'CROBAR', method. The testing was carried out with a cube from a MURaM 3D MHD simulation, which affords a coronal-like 'ground truth' against which the reconstruction method can be applied and compared. I find that the method does quite well, recovering the 'coronal veil'-like features recently reported from the MURaM simulations, and allaying concerns that these features would thwart recovery of valid 3D coronal structure from a limited number of perspectives. I also find that a second perspective at between $\sim 45$ and 90 degrees, does significantly improve the reconstructions. Two distinct channels with Soft X-Ray like temperature response (peaking above 5 MK) would suffice for CROBAR's optically thin observables; barring that, a suite of AIA-like EUV passbands, with good coverage of the 3-8 MK temperature range. |

|**Abstract**| The large number of ongoing surveys for pulsars and transients at various radio observatories is motivated by the science obtained from these sources. Timing and polarisation analysis of relativistic binaries can place strong constraints on theories of gravity. The observation of a growing number of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) spread over the celestial sphere may allow the detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background arising from supermassive black hole binaries. A more complete sample of young pulsars improves our knowledge of neutron star birth and evolution. Transients such as fast radio bursts can serve to probe the intergalactic medium. The SPAN512 pulsar survey covers intermediate Galactic latitudes using the L-band receiver of the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope (NRT). The survey covers 224 sq. deg. of the sky for a total exposure time of 2200 h. Population syntheses predict the discovery of 3 to 19 new normal pulsars and a few MSPs. We present detailed modelling of the NRT beam with its L-band receiver and its sensitivity which we used to precisely assess the expected survey yield. We used the flexible Pulsar Arecibo L-band Feed Array data processing pipeline to search the 47 TB of SPAN512 data for pulsars and transients. The SPAN512 survey discovered two new MSPs and one new middle-aged pulsar. We focus on the analysis of the 2.4-ms spin period pulsar J2205+6012 for which we also report the detection of gamma-ray pulsations. Its narrow pulse width (35 $\mu$s at an observing frequency of 2.55 GHz) allows for sub-microsecond timing precision over 8 years, with exciting prospects for pulsar timing array programs. |

|| <mark>Sihui Zhong</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2022-09-07*|

|**Abstract**| Decayless kink oscillations of an ensemble of loops are captured simultaneously by the High Resolution Imager (HRI) of the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) from 22:58 UT on 5 November to 00:27 UT on 6 November 2021. Oscillations are analysed by processing image sequences taken by the two instruments with a motion magnification technique. The analysed loops are around 51 Mm in length, and oscillate with short periods of 1-3 min (1.6 min in average) and displacement amplitudes of 27-83 km. The signals recorded by AIA are delayed by 66 s as compared to HRI, which coincides with the light travel time difference from the Sun to each instrument. After correction of this time difference, the cross-correlation coefficient between the signals from the two data varies from 0.82 to 0.97, indicating that they are well consistent. This work confirms that HRI sees the same oscillations as AIA, which is the necessary first step before proceeding to the detection of shorter time scales by EUI. In addition, our results indicate the robustness of the de-jittering procedure in the study of kink oscillations with HRI. |

|**Abstract**| In the manuscript, a 3.8yr optical quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) is reported in blue quasar SDSS J132144+033055 (=\obj) at $z=0.269$, based on 16.3yr-long light curve from both CSS and ZTF directly described by a sinusoidal function. The 3.8yr QPOs can be confirmed through the Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram with confidence level higher than 5$\sigma$, through properties of the phase-folded light curve and the WWZ technique. Moreover, the collected Pan-STARRS light curves well follow the sinusoidal function described best fitting results to the CSS and ZTF light curves. The optical QPOs strongly indicate a central binary black hole (BBH) system in \obj, with expected space separation smaller than 0.018pc, through the estimated upper limit of total BH mass $3.3\times10^9{\rm M_\odot}$ through the correlation between BH mass and continuum luminosity. Meanwhile, we check disk precession applied to explain the optical QPOs. However, under the disk precession assumption, the determined optical emission regions from central BH have sizes about $37{\rm R_G}$ similar as the sizes $35{\rm R_G}$ of the expected NUV emission regions through the correlation between disk size and BH mass, indicating the disk precession is not preferred. And due to undetected radio emissions, jet precession can be ruled out. Furthermore, only 0.1\% probability can determined as the QPOs mis-detected through CAR process randomly created light curves related to intrinsic AGN activities, re-confirming the optical QPOs with significance level higher than 3$\sigma$. Therefore, combining long-term light curves from CSS and ZTF can lead to more QPOs candidates in the near future. |

|**Abstract**| All-sky searches for continuous gravitational waves are generally model dependent and computationally costly to run. By contrast, SOAP is a model-agnostic search that rapidly returns candidate signal tracks in the time-frequency plane. In this work we extend the SOAP search to return broad Bayesian posteriors on the astrophysical parameters of a specific signal model. These constraints drastically reduce the volume of parameter space that any follow-up search needs to explore, so increasing the speed at which candidates can be identified and confirmed. Our method uses a machine learning technique, specifically a conditional variational auto-encoder, and delivers a rapid estimation of the posterior distribution of the four Doppler parameters of a continuous wave signal. It does so without requiring a clear definition of a likelihood function, or being shown any true Bayesian posteriors in training. We demonstrate how the Doppler parameter space volume can be reduced by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$ for signals of SNR 100. |

|**Abstract**| Ionized gas in the halo circumgalactic medium leaves an imprint on the cosmic microwave background via the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect. Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and supernovae can affect the measurements of the integrated tSZ flux of halos ($Y_\mathrm{SZ}$) and cause its relation with the halo mass ($Y_\mathrm{SZ}-M$) to deviate from the self-similar power-law prediction of the virial theorem. We perform a comprehensive study of such deviations using CAMELS, a suite of hydrodynamic simulations with extensive variations in feedback prescriptions. We use a combination of two machine learning tools (random forest and symbolic regression) to search for analogues of the $Y-M$ relation which are more robust to feedback processes for low masses ($M\lesssim 10^{14}\, h^{-1} \, M_\odot$); we find that simply replacing $Y\rightarrow Y(1+M_*/M_\mathrm{gas})$ in the relation makes it remarkably self-similar. This could serve as a robust multiwavelength mass proxy for low-mass clusters and galaxy groups. Our methodology can also be generally useful to improve the domain of validity of other astrophysical scaling relations. We also forecast that measurements of the $Y-M$ relation could provide percent-level constraints on certain combinations of feedback parameters and/or rule out a major part of the parameter space of supernova and AGN feedback models used in current state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations. Our results can be useful for using upcoming SZ surveys (e.g. SO, CMB-S4) and galaxy surveys (e.g. DESI and Rubin) to constrain the nature of baryonic feedback. Finally, we find that the an alternative relation, $Y-M_*$, provides complementary information on feedback than $Y-M$. |

|**Abstract**| In the manuscript, the blue quasar SDSS J105816.19+544310.2 (=SDSS J1058+5443) at redshift 0.479 is reported as so-far the best candidate of true type-2 quasar with disappearance of central BLRs. There are so-far no definite conclusions on the very existence of true type-2 AGN, mainly due to detected optical broad emission lines in high quality spectra of some previously classified candidates of true type-2 AGN. Here, not similar as previous reported candidates for true type-2 AGN among narrow emission-line galaxies with weak AGN activities but strong stellar lights, the definite blue quasar SDSS J1058+5443 can be well confirmed as a true type-2 quasar due to apparent quasar-shape blue continuum emissions but apparent loss of both the optical broad Balmer emission lines and the NUV broad Mg~{\sc ii} emission line. Based on different model functions and F-test statistical technique, after considering blue-shifted optical and UV Fe~{\sc ii} emissions, there are no apparent broad optical Balmer emission lines and/or broad NUV Mg~{\sc ii} line, and the confidence level is smaller than 1sigma to support broad optical and NUV emission lines. Moreover, assumed the Virialization assumption to broad line emission clouds, the re-constructed broad emission lines strongly indicate that the probable intrinsic broad emission lines, if there were, cannot be hidden or overwhelmed in the noises of SDSS spectrum of SDSS J1058+5443. Therefore, SDSS J1058+5443, so-far the best and robust candidate of true type-2 quasar, leads to the further clear conclusion on the very existence of true type-2 AGN. |

|**Abstract**| We present the discovery of 2MASS J05241392-0336543 (hereafter J0524-0336), a very metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-2.43 \pm 0.16), highly r-process-enhanced ([Eu/Fe]=+1.34 \pm 0.10) Milky Way halo field red giant star, with an ultra high Li abundance of A(Li)(3D,NLTE)=5.62 \pm 0.25 and [Li/Fe]=+7.00 \pm 0.25, respectively. This makes J0524-0336 the most lithium-enhanced giant star discovered to date. We present a detailed analysis of the star's atmospheric stellar parameters and chemical-abundance determinations. Additionally, we detect infrared excess and variable emission in the wings of the H$_\alpha$ absorption line across multiple epochs, indicative of a potential enhanced mass-loss event with possible outflows. Our analysis reveals that J0524-0336 lies either between the bump and the tip of the Red Giant Branch (RGB), or on the early-Asymptotic Giant Branch (e-AGB). We investigate the possible sources of lithium enrichment in J0524-0336, including both internal and external sources. Based on current models and on the observational evidence we have collected, our study shows that J0524-0336 may be undergoing the so-called lithium flash that is expected to occur in low-mass stars when they reach the RGB bump and/or the early-AGB. |

|**Abstract**| The Far-side Array for Radio Science Investigations of the Dark ages and Exoplanets (FARSIDE) is a proposed mission concept to the lunar far side that seeks to deploy and operate an array of 128 dual-polarization, dipole antennas over a region of 100 square kilometers. The resulting interferometric radio telescope would provide unprecedented radio images of distant star systems, allowing for the investigation of faint radio signatures of coronal mass ejections and energetic particle events and could also lead to the detection of magnetospheres around exoplanets within their parent star's habitable zone. Simultaneously, FARSIDE would also measure the "Dark Ages" of the early Universe at a global 21-cm signal across a range of red shifts (z approximately 50-100). Each discrete antenna node in the array is connected to a central hub (located at the lander) via a communication and power tether. Nodes are driven by cold=operable electronics that continuously monitor an extremely wide-band of frequencies (200 kHz to 40 MHz), which surpass the capabilities of Earth-based telescopes by two orders of magnitude. Achieving this ground-breaking capability requires a robust deployment strategy on the lunar surface, which is feasible with existing, high TRL technologies (demonstrated or under active development) and is capable of delivery to the surface on next-generation commercial landers, such as Blue Origin's Blue Moon Lander. This paper presents an antenna packaging, placement, and surface deployment trade study that leverages recent advances in tethered mobile robots under development at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which are used to deploy a flat, antenna-embedded, tape tether with optical communication and power transmission capabilities. |

|**Abstract**| Dark Matter (DM) is one of the most critical questions to be understood and answered in fundamental physics today. Observations with varied astronomical and cosmological technologies already pinned down that DM exists in the Universe, the Milky Way, and the Solar System. Nevertheless, understanding DM under the language of elementary physics is still in progress. DM direct detection tests the interactive cross-section between galactic DM particles and an underground detector's nucleons. Although Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMPs) are the most discussed DM candidates, the null-WIMPs conclusion has been consistently addressed by the most convincing experiments in the field. Relatively, the low-mass WIMPs region ($\sim$ 10 MeV/c$^2$ - 10 GeV/c$^2$) has not been fully exploited compared to high-mass WIMPs ($\sim$ 10 GeV/c$^2$ - 10 TeV/c$^2$). The ALETHEIA (A Liquid hElium Time projection cHambEr In dArk matter) experiment aims to hunt for low-mass WIMPs with liquid helium-filled TPCs (Time Projection Chambers). In this paper, we go through the physics motivation of the project, the detector's design, the R\&D plan, and the progress we have made since the project has been launched in the summer of 2020. |

|**Abstract**| Cen X-3 is the first X-ray pulsar discovered 50 years ago. Radiation from such objects is expected to be highly polarized due to birefringence of plasma and vacuum associated with propagation of photons in presence of the strong magnetic field. Here we present results of the observations of Cen X-3 performed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. The source exhibited significant flux variability and was observed in two states different by a factor of ~20 in flux. In the low-luminosity state no significant polarization was found either in pulse phase-averaged (with the 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 12%) or phase-resolved data (the 3$\sigma$ upper limits are 20-30%). In the bright state the polarization degree of 5.8$\pm$0.3% and polarization angle of $49.6\deg\pm1.5\deg$ with significance of about 20$\sigma$ was measured from the spectro-polarimetric analysis of the phase-averaged data. The phase-resolved analysis showed a significant anti-correlation between the flux and the polarization degree as well as strong variations of the polarization angle. The fit with the rotating vector model indicates a position angle of the pulsar spin axis of about 49$\deg$ and a magnetic obliquity of 17$\deg$. The detected relatively low polarization can be explained if the upper layers of the neutron star surface are overheated by the accreted matter and the conversion of the polarization modes occurs within the transition region between the upper hot layer and a cooler underlying atmosphere. A fraction of polarization signal can also be produced by reflection of radiation from the neutron star surface and the accretion curtain. |

|**Abstract**| We report X-ray spectral variability in an ultraluminous X-ray source NGC 1042 ULX1, using archival XMM-NEWTON and recent NuSTAR observations. In long-term evolution, the source has shown a trend of variation in spectral hardness. The variability in different XMM-NEWTON observations is prominent above $\sim 1$ keV. Cool thermal disk component with a characteristic temperature of $\sim 0.2$ keV manifests that the spectral state of NGC 1042 ULX1 in all epochs is similar to that of the ultraluminous state sources. An apparent anti-correlation between luminosity and powerlaw index demonstrates that the source becomes spectrally harder when it is in a brighter state. That is conceivably related to stronger Comptonization when the accretion rate is higher or due to a change in the occultation of the disk geometry. Typical hard ultraluminous type spectra indicate that NGC 1042 ULX1 is a low inclination system in general. Spectral properties suggest that, like many other ULXs which show spectral curvature around $\sim 6-10$ keV, NGC 1042 ULX1 could be another stellar-mass super-Eddington accretor. |

|**Abstract**| Stellar flares of active M dwarfs can affect the atmospheric composition of close-orbiting gas giants, and can result in time-dependent transmission spectra. We aim to examine the impact of a variety of flares, differing in energy, duration, and occurrence frequency, on the composition and spectra of close-orbiting, tidally locked gaseous planets with climates dominated by equatorial superrotation. We used a series of pseudo-2D photo- and thermochemical kinetics models, which take advection by the equatorial jet stream into account, to simulate the neutral molecular composition of a gaseous planet (effective temperature 800 K) that orbits a flaring M dwarf. We then computed transmission spectra for the evening and morning limb. We find that the upper regions of the dayside and evening limb are heavily depleted in CH4 and NH3 up to several days after a flare with a total radiative energy of $ 2 \times 10^{33} $ erg. Molar fractions of C2H2 and HCN are enhanced up to a factor three on the nightside and morning limb after day-to-nightside advection of photodissociated species. CH4 depletion reduces transit depths by 100-300 parts per million (ppm) on the evening limb and C2H2 production increases the 14 micron feature up to 350 ppm on the morning limb. We find that repeated flaring drives the atmosphere to a composition that differs from its pre-flare distribution and that this translates to a permanent modification of the transmission spectrum. We show that single high-energy flares can affect the atmospheres of close-orbiting gas giants up to several days after the flare event, during which their transmission spectra are altered by several hundred ppm. Repeated flaring has important implications for future retrieval analyses of exoplanets around active stars, as the atmospheric composition and resulting spectral signatures substantially differ from models that do not include flaring. |

|**Abstract**| We present a measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) using type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) in the near-infrared (NIR) from the recently updated sample of SNe Ia in nearby galaxies with distances measured via Cepheid period-luminosity relations by the SHOES project. We collect public near-infrared photometry of up to 19 calibrator SNe Ia and further 57 SNe Ia in the Hubble flow ($z>0.01$), and directly measure their peak magnitudes in the $J$ and $H$ band by Gaussian processes and spline interpolation. Calibrator peak magnitudes together with Cepheid-based distances are used to estimate the average absolute magnitude in each band, while Hubble-flow SNe are used to constrain the zero-point intercept of the magnitude-redshift relation. Our baseline result of $H_0$ is $72.3\pm1.4$ (stat) $\pm1.4$ (syst) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the $J$ band and $72.3\pm1.3$ (stat) $\pm1.4$ (syst) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the $H$ band, where the systematic uncertainties include the standard deviation of up to 21 variations of the analysis, the 0.7\% distance scale systematic from SHOES Cepheid anchors, a photometric zeropoint systematic, and a cosmic variance systematic. Our final measurement represents a measurement with a precision of 2.8\% in both bands. The variant with the largest change in $H_0$ is when limiting the sample to SNe from CSP and CfA programmes, noteworthy because these are the best calibrated, yielding $H_0\sim75$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in both bands. We demonstrate stretch and reddening corrections are still useful in the NIR to standardize SN Ia NIR peak magnitudes. Based on our results, in order to improve the precision of the $H_0$ measurement with SNe Ia in the NIR in the future, we would need to increase the number of calibrator SNe Ia, be able to extend the Hubble-Lema\^itre diagram to higher-z, and include standardization procedures to help reducing the NIR intrinsic scatter. |

|**Abstract**| This paper presents a stochastic three-dimensional (3D) focused transport simulation of solar energetic particles (SEPs) produced by a data-driven coronal mass ejection (CME) shock propagating through a data-driven model of coronal and heliospheric magnetic fields. The injection of SEPs at the CME shock is treated using diffusive shock acceleration of post-shock superthermal solar wind ions. A time backward stochastic simulation is employed to solve the transport equation to obtain the SEP time-intensity profile at any location, energy, and pitch angle. The model is applied to a SEP event on 2020 May 29, observed by STEREO-A close to 1 au and by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) when it was about 0.33 au away from the Sun. The SEP event was associated with a very slow CME with a plane-of-sky speed of 337 km/s at a height below 6 $\rm R_S$ as reported in the SOHO/LASCO CME catalog. We compute the time profiles of particle flux at PSP and STEREO-A locations, and estimate both the spectral index of the proton energy spectrum for energies between 2 and 16 MeV and the equivalent path length of the magnetic field lines experienced by the first arriving SEPs. We found that the simulation results are well correlated with observations. The SEP event could be explained by the acceleration of particles by a weak CME shock in the low solar corona that is not magnetically connected to the observers. |

|**Abstract**| In this chapter, we provide a review of radiative processes in cometary atmospheres spanning a broad range of wavelengths, from radio to X-rays. We focus on spectral modeling, observational opportunities, and anticipated challenges in the interpretation of new observations, based on our current understanding of the atomic and molecular processes occurring in the atmospheres of small, icy bodies. Close to the surface, comets possess a thermalized atmosphere that traces the irregular shape of the nucleus. Gravity is too low to retain the gas, which flows out to form a large, collisionless exosphere (coma) that interacts with the heliospheric radiation environment. As such, cometary comae represent conditions that are familiar in the context of planetary atmosphere studies. However, the outer comae are tenuous, with densities lower than those found in vacuum chambers on Earth. Comets, therefore, provide us with unique natural laboratories that can be understood using state-of-the-art theoretical treatments of the relevant microphysical processes. Radiative processes offer direct diagnostics of the local physical conditions, as well as the macroscopic coma properties.These can be used to improve our understanding of comets and other astrophysical environments such as icy moons and the interstellar medium. |

|**Abstract**| Space-based gamma-ray telescopes such as the Fermi Large Area Telescope have used single sided silicon strip detectors to track secondary charged particles produced by primary gamma-rays with high resolution. At the lower energies targeted by keV-MeV telescopes, two dimensional position information within a single detector is required for event reconstruction - especially in the Compton regime. This work describes the development of monolithic CMOS active pixel silicon sensors - AstroPix - as a novel technology for use in future gamma-ray telescopes. Based upon sensors (ATLASPix) designed for use in the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider, AstroPix has the potential to maintain high performance while reducing noise with low power consumption. This is achieved with the dual detection and readout capabilities in each CMOS pixel. The status of AstroPix development and testing, as well as outlook for future testing and application, will be presented. |

|**Abstract**| In the interstellar medium (ISM), the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) is largely facilitated by surface reactions. However, in cold dark clouds, thermal desorption of COMs is inefficient because of the lack of thermal energy to overcome binding energies to the grain surface. Non-thermal desorption methods are therefore important explanations for the gas-phase detection of many COMs that are primarily formed on grains. Here we present a new non-thermal desorption process: cosmic ray sputtering of grain ice surfaces based on water, carbon dioxide, and a simple mixed ice. Our model applies estimated rates of sputtering to the 3-phase rate equation model Nautilus-1.1, where this inclusion results in enhanced gas phase abundances for molecules produced by grain reactions such as methanol (CH$_{3}$OH) and methyl formate (HCOOCH$_{3}$). Notably, species with efficient gas phase destruction pathways exhibit less of an increase in models with sputtering compared to other molecules. These model results suggest that sputtering is an efficient, non-specific method of non-thermal desorption that should be considered as an important factor in future chemical models. |

|**Abstract**| Context. Most small asteroids (<50 km in diameter) are the result of the breakup of a larger parent body and are often considered to be rubble-pile objects. Similar structures are expected for the secondaries of small asteroid binaries, including Dimorphos, the smaller component of the 65803 Didymos binary system and the target of NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) and ESA's Hera mission. The DART impact occurs on September 26th, 2022 and it will alter the orbital period of Dimorphos around Didymos. Aims. In this work we assume Dimorphos-like bodies with a rubble-pile structure, and quantify the effects of boulder packing in its interior on the post-impact morphology, degree of shape change and material ejection processes. Methods. We used the Bern SPH shock physics code to numerically model hypervelocity impacts into small, 160 m in diameter rubble-pile asteroids, with a variety of boulder distributions. Results. We find that the post-impact target morphology is most sensitive to the mass-fraction of boulders in the target, while the asteroid deflection efficiency depends on both the mass-fraction of boulders in the target and on the boulder size-distribution close to the impact point. Our results may also have important implications for the structure of small asteroids. |

|**Abstract**| S190426c / GW190426_152155 was the first probable neutron star - black hole merger candidate detected by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration. We undertook a tiled search for optical counterparts of this event using the 0.7m GROWTH-India Telescope. Over a period of two weeks, we obtained multiple observations over a 22.1 deg^2 area, with a 17.5% probability of containing the source location. Initial efforts included obtaining photometry of sources reported by various groups, and a visual search for sources in all galaxies contained in the region. Subsequently, we have developed an image subtraction and candidate vetting pipeline with ~ 94% efficiency for transient detection. Processing the data with this pipeline, we find several transients, but none that are compatible with kilonova models. We present the details of our observations, working of our pipeline, results from the search, and our interpretations of the non-detections that will work as a pathfinder during the O4 run of LVK. |

|**Abstract**| Disk winds are an important mechanism for accretion and disk evolution around young stars. The accreting intermediate-mass T-Tauri star RY Tau has an active jet and a previously known disk wind. Archival optical and new near-infrared observations of the RY Tau system show two horn-like components stretching out as a cone from RY Tau. Scattered light from the disk around RY Tau is visible in near-infrared but not seen at optical wavelengths. In the near-infrared, dark wedges that separates the horns from the disk, indicating we may see the scattered light from a disk wind. We use archived ALMA and SPHERE/ZIMPOL I-band observations combined with newly acquired SPEHRE/IRDIS H-band observations and available literature to build a simple geometric model of the RY Tau disk and disk wind. We use Monte Carlo radiative transfer modelling \textit{MCMax3D} to create comparable synthetic observations that test the effect of a dusty wind on the optical effect in the observations. We constrain the grain size and dust mass needed in the disk wind to reproduce the effect from the observations. A model geometrically reminiscent of a dusty disk wind with small micron to sub-micron size grains elevated above the disk can reproduce the optical effect seen in the observations. The mass in the obscuring component of the wind has been constrained to $1\times10^{-9} M_{\odot} \leq M \leq 5\times10^{-8} M_{\odot}$ which corresponds to a lower limit mass loss rate in the wind of about $\sim 1\times10^{-8}M_{\odot}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. While an illuminate dust cavity cannot be ruled out without measurements of the gas velocity, we argue that a magnetically launched disk wind is the most likely scenario. |

|**Abstract**| Studying the interplay between massive star formation and the interstellar medium (ISM) is paramount to understand the evolution of galaxies. Radio continuum (RC) emission serves as an extinction-free tracer of both massive star formation and the energetic components of the interstellar medium. We present a multi-band radio continuum survey of the local group galaxy M 33 down to ~30 pc linear resolution observed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We calibrate the star-formation rate surface density and investigate the impact of diffuse emission on this calibration using a structural decomposition. Separating the thermal and nonthermal emission components, the correlation between different phases of the interstellar medium and the impact of massive star formation are also investigated. Radio sources with sizes <~ 200 pc constitute about 36% (46%) of the total RC emission at 1.5 GHz (6.3 GHz) in the inner 18' x 18' (or 4kpc x 4kpc) disk of M 33. The nonthermal spectral index becomes flatter with increasing star-formation rate surface density, indicating the escape of cosmic ray electrons {from their birth places}. The magnetic field strength also increases with star-formation rate following a bi-modal relation, indicating that the small-scale turbulent dynamo acts more efficiently at higher luminosities and star-formation rates. Although the correlations are tighter in star-forming regions, the nonthermal emission is correlated also with the more quiescent molecular gas in the ISM. An almost linear molecular star-formation law exists in M 33 when excluding diffuse structures. Massive star formation amplifies the magnetic field and increases the number of high-energy cosmic ray electrons, which can help the onset of winds and outflows. |

|**Abstract**| The origin of close-in giant planets is a key open question in planet formation theory. The two leading models are formation at the outer disk followed by migration and in-situ formation. In this work, we determine the atmospheric composition of warm Jupiters for both formation scenarios. We perform N-body simulations of planetesimal accretion inside and outside the water ice-line for various planetary formation locations, planetary masses, and planetesimal sizes to estimate the accreted heavy-element mass and final planetary composition. We find that both models differ significantly: migrating giant planets have 2-14 times higher metallicities than planets that form in-situ. The ratio between refractories and volatiles is found to be above one for migrating planets but below 0.4 for planets that form in-situ. We also identify very different trends between heavy-element enrichment and planetary mass for these two formation mechanisms. While the metallicity of migrating planets is found to increase with decreasing planetary mass, it is about constant for in-situ formation. Our study highlights the importance of measuring the atmospheric composition of warm Jupiters and its connection to their formation and evolutionary paths. |

|**Abstract**| Temperature profiles retrieved using the first set of data of the Emirates Mars InfraRed Spectrometer (EMIRS) obtained during the science phase of the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM) are used for the analysis of migrating thermal tides in the Martian atmosphere. The selected data cover a solar longitude (LS) range of 60{\deg}-90{\deg} of Martian Year (MY) 36. The novel orbit design of the Hope Probe leads to a good geographic and local time coverage that significantly improves the analysis. Wave mode decomposition suggests dominant diurnal tide and important semi-diurnal tide with maximal amplitudes of 6K and 2K, respectively, as well as the existence of ~0.5K ter-diurnal tide. The results agree well with predictions by the Mars Planetary Climate Model (PCM), but the observed diurnal tide has an earlier phase (3h), and the semi-diurnal tide has an unexpectedly large wavelength (~200km). |

|**Abstract**| Presolar grains are trace components in chondrite matrices. Their abundances and compositions have been systematically studied in carbonaceous chondrites but rarely in situ in other major chondrite classes. We have conducted a NanoSIMS isotopic search for presolar grains with O- and C-anomalous isotopic compositions in the matrices of the unequilibrated ordinary chondrites Semarkona, Meteorite Hills 00526, and Northwest Africa 8276. The matrices of even the most primitive ordinary chondrites have been aqueously altered and/or thermally metamorphosed, destroying their presolar grain populations to varying extents. In addition to randomly placed isotope maps, we targeted recently reported, relatively pristine Semarkona matrix areas to better explore the original inventory of presolar grains. In all samples, we found a total of 122 O-anomalous grains (silicates + oxides), 79 SiC grains, and 22 C-anomalous carbonaceous grains (organics, graphites). Average matrix-normalized abundances are 151 ppm O-anomalous grains, 53 ppm SiC grains and 56 ppm carbonaceous grains in Semarkona, 55 ppm (O-anom.), 22 ppm (SiC) and 3 ppm (carb.) in MET 00526 and 12 ppm (O-anom.), 15 ppm (SiC) and 1 ppm (carb.) in NWA 8276. In relatively pristine ordinary chondrites and in primitive carbonaceous and C-ungrouped chondrites, the O and C isotopic composition of presolar grains and their matrix-normalized abundances are similar, despite the likely differences in chondrite-formation time and nebular location. These results suggest a relatively homogenous distribution of presolar dust across major chondrite-forming reservoirs in the solar nebula. Secondary asteroidal processes are mainly responsible for differences in presolar grain abundances between and within chondrites, highlighting the need to identify and target the most pristine chondrite matrices for such studies. |
