|**Abstract**| In November 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) returned deep near-infrared images of Abell~2744 -- a powerful lensing cluster capable of magnifying distant, incipient galaxies beyond it. Together with the existing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, this publicly available dataset opens a fundamentally new discovery space to understand the remaining mysteries of the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. In this work, we detect and measure some 50,000 objects across the 45 arcmin$^2$ JWST footprint down to a $5\,\sigma$ limiting magnitude of $\sim$29.9\,mag in 0.32" apertures. Photometry is performed using circular apertures on images matched to the point spread function of the reddest NIRCam band, F444W, and cleaned of bright cluster galaxies and the related intra-cluster light. To give an impression of the photometric performance, we measure photometric redshifts and achieve a $\sigma_{\rm NMAD}\approx0.03$ based on known, but relatively small, spectroscopic samples. With this paper, we publicly release HST and JWST PSF-matched photometric catalogs optimized for bright and extended sources (0.7" apertures) and compact and faint sources (0.32" apertures) along with basic photometric redshifts, rest-frame colors, and individual magnification estimates. These catalogs will set the stage for efficient and deep spectroscopic follow-up of the first JWST-selected samples in Summer 2023. |

|**Abstract**| We present the first exoplanet phase curve measurement made with the JWST NIRSpec instrument, highlighting the exceptional stability of this newly-commissioned observatory for exoplanet climate studies. The target, WASP-121b, is an ultrahot Jupiter with an orbital period of 30.6 hr. We analyze two broadband light curves generated for the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors, covering wavelength ranges of 2.70-3.72 micron and 3.82-5.15 micron, respectively. Both light curves exhibit minimal systematics, with approximately linear drifts in the baseline flux level of 30 ppm/hr (NRS1) and 10 ppm/hr (NRS2). Assuming a simple brightness map for the planet described by a low-order spherical harmonic dipole, our light curve fits suggest that the phase curve peaks coincide with orbital phases $3.36 \pm 0.11$ deg (NRS1) and $2.66 \pm 0.12$ deg (NRS2) prior to mid-eclipse. This is consistent with the strongest dayside emission emanating from eastward of the substellar point. We measure planet-to-star emission ratios of $3,924 \pm 7$ ppm (NRS1) and $4,924 \pm 9$ ppm (NRS2) for the dayside hemisphere, and $136 \pm 8$ ppm (NRS1) and $630 \pm 10$ ppm (NRS2) for the nightside hemisphere. The latter nightside emission ratios translate to planetary brightness temperatures of $926 \pm 12$ K (NRS1) and $1,122 \pm 10$ K (NRS2), which are low enough for a wide range of refractory condensates to form, including enstatite and forsterite. A nightside cloud deck may be blocking emission from deeper, hotter layers of the atmosphere, potentially helping to explain why cloud-free 3D general circulation model simulations systematically over-predict the nightside emission for WASP-121b. |

|**Abstract**| FU Orionis-type objects (FUors) are low-mass pre-main-sequence objects which go through a short-lived phase (~100 years) of increased mass accretion rate (from 10^-8 to 10^-4 M_sun yr^-1). These eruptive young stars are in the early stages of stellar evolution and, thus, still deeply embedded in a massive envelope that feeds material to the circumstellar disk that is then accreted onto the star. Some FUors drive molecular outflows, i.e. low-velocity wide-angle magneto-hydrodynamical winds, that inject energy and momentum back to the surrounding envelopes, and help clear the material surrounding the young star. Here we present a 12CO (3--2), 13CO (3--2) and 12CO (4--3) survey of 20 FUor-type eruptive young stars observed with APEX. We use our 13CO (3--2) observations to measure the masses of the envelopes surrounding each FUor and find an agreement with the FUor evolutionary trend found from the 10um silicate feature. We find outflows in 11 FUors, calculate their masses and other kinematic properties, and compare these with those of outflows found around quiescent young stellar objects gathered from the literature. This comparison indicates that outflows in FUors are more massive than outflows in quiescent sources, and that FUor outflows have a higher ratio outflow mass with respect to the envelope than the quiescent sample, indicating that the eruptive young stars have lower star-forming efficiencies. Finally, we found that the outflow forces in FUors are similar to those of quiescent young stellar objects, indicating that their accretion histories are similar or that the FUor outflows have lower velocities. |

|**Abstract**| Using 190,000 spectra from the seventeenth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we investigate the ultraviolet emission line properties in z=2 quasars. Specifically, we quantify how the shape of CIV 1549A and the equivalent width (EW) of HeII 1640A depend on the black hole mass and Eddington ratio inferred from MgII 2800A. Above L/L_Edd>0.2, there is a strong mass dependence in both CIV blueshift and HeII EW. Large CIV blueshifts are observed only in regions with both high mass and high accretion rate. Including X-ray measurements for a subsample of 5,300 objects, we interpret our observations in the context of AGN accretion and outflow mechanisms. The observed trends in HeII and 2 keV strength are broadly consistent with theoretical QSOSED models of AGN spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for low spin black holes, where the ionizing SED depends on the accretion disc temperature and the strength of the soft excess. High spin models are not consistent with observations, suggesting SDSS quasars at z=2 may in general have low spins. We find a dramatic switch in behaviour at L/L_Edd<0.2: the ultraviolet emission properties show much weaker trends, and no longer agree with QSOSED predictions, hinting at changes in the structure of the broad line region. Overall the observed emission line trends are generally consistent with predictions for radiation line driving where quasar outflows are governed by the SED, which itself results from the accretion flow and hence depends on both the SMBH mass and accretion rate. |

|**Abstract**| The "cosmic web", the filamentary large-scale structure in a cold dark matter Universe, is readily apparent via galaxy tracers in spectroscopic surveys. However, the underlying dark matter structure is as of yet unobservable and mapping the diffuse gas permeating it lies beyond practical observational capabilities. A recently developed technique, inspired by the growth and movement of Physarum polycephalum "slime mold", has been used to map the cosmic web of a low redshift sub-sample of the SDSS spectroscopic galaxy catalog. This model, the Monte Carlo Physarum Machine (MCPM) was shown to promisingly reconstruct the cosmic web. Here, we improve the formalism used in calibrating the MCPM to better recreate the Bolshoi-Planck cosmological simulation's density distributions and apply them to a significantly larger cosmological volume than previous works using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, $z < 0.1$) and the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG, $z \lesssim 0.5$) spectroscopic catalogs. We present the "Cosmic Slime Value Added Catalog" which provides estimates for the cosmic overdensity for the sample of galaxies probed spectroscopically by the above SDSS surveys. In addition, we provide the fully reconstructed 3D density cubes of these volumes. These data products were released as part of Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17 and are publicly available. We present the input catalogs and the methodology for constructing these data products. We also highlight exciting potential applications to galaxy evolution, cosmology, the intergalactic and circumgalactic medium, and transient phenomenon localization. |

|**Abstract**| SMSS J160540.18$-$144323.1 is the carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) star with the lowest iron abundance ever measured, [Fe/H]=-6.2, which was first reported with the SkyMapper telescope. The carbon abundance is A(C)~6.1 in the low-C band, as the majority of the stars in this metallicity range. Yet, constraining the isotopic ratio of key species, such as carbon, sheds light on the properties and origin of these elusive stars. We performed high-resolution observations of SMSS1605$-$1443 with the ESPRESSO spectrograph to look for variations in the radial velocity ($v_{rad}$) with time. These data have been combined with older MIKE and UVES archival observations to enlarge the temporal baseline. The $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratio is also studied to explore the possibility of mass transfer from a binary companion. A cross-correlation function against a natural template was applied to detect $v_{rad}$ variability and a spectral synthesis technique was used to derive $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C in the stellar atmosphere. We confirm previous indications of binarity in SMSS1605$-$1443 and measured a lower limit $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C$>60$ at more than a 3$\sigma$ confidence level, proving that this system is chemically unmixed and that no mass transfer from the unseen companion has happened so far. Thus, we confirm the CEMP-no nature of SMSS1605$-$1443 and show that the pristine chemical composition of the cloud from which it formed is currently imprinted in its stellar atmosphere free of contamination. |

|**Abstract**| Understanding the origins of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) - which reach energies in excess of $10^{20}~{\rm eV}$ - stretches particle acceleration physics to its very limits. In this review, we discuss how such energies can be reached, using general arguments that can often be derived on the back of an envelope. We explore possible particle acceleration mechanisms, with special attention paid to shock acceleration. Informed by the arguments derived, we discuss where UHECRs might come from and which classes of powerful astrophysical objects could be UHECR sources; generally, we favour radio galaxies, GRB afterglows and other sources which are not too compact and dissipate prodigious amounts of energy on large scales, allowing them to generate large products $\beta B R$ without the CRs undergoing restrictive losses. Finally, we discuss when UHECRs are accelerated by highlighting the importance of source variability, and explore the intriguing possibility that the UHECR arrival directions are partly a result of "echoes" from magnetic structures in the local Universe. |

|**Abstract**| The Haystack Telescope is an antenna with a diameter of 37~m and an elevation-dependent surface accuracy of $\le{}100~\mu{}\rm{}m$ that is capable of millimeter-wave observations. The radome-enclosed instrument serves as a radar sensor for space situational awareness, with about one-third of the time available for research by MIT Haystack Observatory. Ongoing testing with the K-band (18-26~GHz) and W-band receivers (currently 85-93~GHz) is preparing the inclusion of the telescope into the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) array and the use as a single-dish research telescope. Given its geographic location, the addition of the Haystack Telescope to current and future versions of the EHT array would substantially improve the image quality. |

|**Abstract**| We combine datasets from the CGM$^{2}$ and CASBaH surveys to model a transition point, $R_{\rm cross}$, between circumgalactic and intergalactic media (CGM and IGM, respectively). In total, our data consist of 7244 galaxies at z < 0.5 with precisely measured spectroscopic redshifts, all having impact parameters of 0.01 - 20 comoving Mpc from 28 QSO sightlines with high-resolution UV spectra that cover H I Ly$\alpha$. Our best-fitting model is an exclusionary two-component model that combines a 3D absorber-galaxy cross correlation function with a simple Gaussian profile at inner radii to represent the CGM. By design, this model gives rise to a determination of $R_{\rm cross}$ as a function of galaxy stellar mass, which can be interpreted as the boundary between the CGM and IGM. For galaxies with $10^8 \leq M_{\star}/M_{\odot} \leq 10^{10.5}$, we find that $R_{\rm cross}(M_{\star}) \approx 2 \pm 0.6 R_{\rm vir}$. Additionally, we find excellent agreement between $R_{\rm cross}(M_{\star})$ and the theoretically-determined splashback radius for galaxies in this mass range. Overall, our results favor models of galaxy evolution at z < 0.5 that distribute $T \approx 10^{4}$K gas to distances beyond the virial radius. |

|**Abstract**| It has been well established in the local universe that galaxy properties differ based on the large-scale environment in which they reside. As luminous Lyman-alpha nebulae have been shown to trace overdense environments at z~2-3, comparing the properties of galaxies within Lyman-alpha nebulae systems to those in the field can provide insight into how and when locally-observed trends between galaxy properties and environment emerged. Six Lyman-alpha nebulae were discovered at z~2.3 in a blind search of the GOODS-S extragalactic field, a region also covered by the 3D-HST spectroscopic survey. Utilizing 3D-HST data, we identified 86 galaxies in the vicinity of these nebulae and used statistical tests to compare their physical properties to galaxies elsewhere in the field. Galaxies lying within 320 proper kpc of a Lyman-alpha nebula are roughly half a magnitude brighter than those in the field, with higher stellar masses, higher star formation rates, and larger effective radii. Even when considering the effects of sample incompleteness, our study suggests that galaxies in overdensities at z~2.3 traced by Lyman-alpha nebulae are being influenced by their environment. Furthermore, Lyman-alpha nebula-associated galaxies lie on the same main sequence of star formation as field galaxies, but have a larger proportion of high-mass galaxies, consistent with the idea that galaxy evolution is accelerated in rich environments. Expanded surveys for Lyman-alpha nebulae in other deep extragalactic fields and galaxy spectroscopic follow-up with JWST will better constrain the demographics of Lyman-alpha nebula-associated galaxies. |

|**Abstract**| Planetary nebulae (PNe), the ejected envelopes of red giant stars, provide us with a history of the last, mass-losing phases of 90 percent of stars initially more massive than the Sun. Here, we analyse James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Early Release Observation (ERO) images of the PN NGC3132. A structured, extended H2 halo surrounding an ionised central bubble is imprinted with spiral structures, likely shaped by a low-mass companion orbiting the central star at 40-60 AU. The images also reveal a mid-IR excess at the central star interpreted as a dusty disk, indicative of an interaction with another, closer companion. Including the previously known, A-type visual companion, the progenitor of the NGC3132 PN must have been at least a stellar quartet. The JWST images allow us to generate a model of the illumination, ionisation and hydrodynamics of the molecular halo, demonstrating the power of JWST to investigate complex stellar outflows. Further, new measurements of the A-type visual companion allow us to derive the value for the mass of the progenitor of a central star to date with excellent precision: 2.86+/-0.06 Mo. These results serve as path finders for future JWST observations of PNe providing unique insight into fundamental astrophysical processes including colliding winds, and binary star interactions, with implications for supernovae and gravitational wave systems. |

|**Abstract**| We study the choked accretion process of an ultrarelativistic fluid onto axisymmetric Kerr-Sen black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilation-axion theory. Based on solving procedure mentioned by Petrich, Shapiro,and Teukolsky, we further calculate the solution describing the velocity potential {\Phi} of a stationary, irrotational fluid, which satisfies the stiff equation of state. Then, by using the ZAMO framework, we draw the streamlined diagram of the quadrupolar flow solution and investigate how parameters affect the solution's coefficient and stagnation point. The injection rate, ejection rate, and critical angle are discussed in detail at the end of the article. |

|**Abstract**| Some accretion powered X-ray pulsars with supergiant companion stars undergo occasional rapid spin-up episodes that last for weeks to a few months. We explore the changes in the accretion environment of the pulsar GX 301-2 during its latest 80 days long spin-up episode in 2019 when the spin frequency of the pulsar increased by ~2% over two orbits of the binary. By performing time-resolved spectroscopy with the MAXI/GSC spectra of the source, we estimated the equivalent hydrogen column density and equivalent width of the iron fluorescence line during the spin-up episode, and compared them with the long-term average values estimated by orbital-phase resolved spectroscopy. The measured absorption column density during the spin-up episode is about twice that of an average orbit, while the equivalent width of the iron line is less than half of an average orbit. Though the spin-up episode started immediately after a pre-periastron flare and lasted for the two consecutive orbits of the binary, the associated enhancement in luminosity started a few days after the pre-periastron flare and lasted only during the first orbit, and some enhancement was seen again during the pre-periastron passage of the second orbit. The absorption column density and iron line equivalent width vary throughout the spin-up episode and are distinct from an average orbit. These observations indicate a significant change in the accretion and reprocessing environment in GX 301-2 during the spin-up episode and may hold important clues for the phenomenon in this source and several other sources with supergiant companions. |

|**Abstract**| The escape fraction of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons ($f_{esc}$) is a key parameter for determining the sources of cosmic reionization at $z\geq 6$. At these redshifts, owing to the opacity of the intergalactic medium, LyC emission cannot be measured directly. However LyC leakers during the epoch of reionization could be identified using indirect indicators, that have been extensively tested at low and intermediate redshift. These include a high [OIII]/[OII] flux ratio, a high star formation surface density and a compact size. In this work we present observations of 29 $4.5 \leq z \leq 8$ gravitationally lensed galaxies in the Abell 2744 cluster field. From a combined analysis of JWST-NIRSpec and NIRCam data we accurately derive their physical and spectroscopic properties: our galaxies have low masses $(\log(M_\star)\sim 8.5)$, blue UV spectral slopes ($\beta \sim -2.1$), compact sizes ($r_e \sim 0.3-0.5$ kpc), and high [OIII]/[OII] flux ratios. Such properties are similar to those of low-redshift LyC leakers. Indirectly inferring the fraction of escaping ionizing photons, we find that more than 80\% of our galaxies have predicted $f_{esc}$ larger than 0.05, i.e. they would be considered leakers. The average predicted $f_{esc}$ of our sample is 0.12, suggesting that similar galaxies at $z\geq 6$ provided a substantial contribution to cosmic reionization. |

|**Abstract**| Gravitational waves (GWs) from tens of millions of compact binaries in our Milky Way enter the milli-Hertz band of space-based detection. The majority of them cannot be resolved individually, resulting in a foreground confusion noise for Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The concept of Taiji mission is similar to LISA's with slightly better sensitivity, which means that the galactic GW signals will also affect the detection with Taiji. Here we generate the GW signals from 29.8 million galactic binaries for Taiji and subtract the `resolvable' sources. The confusion noise is estimated and fitted in an analytic form with 6-month, 1-year, 2-year and 4-year observation time. We find that the full sensitivity curve is slightly lower for Taiji than for LISA at frequencies of $\leq 0.8$ mHz and around 2~mHz. For a 4-year lifetime, more than 29 thousand sources are resolvable with Taiji. Compared to LISA, Taiji can subtract $\sim 20 \%$ more sources and the distribution of them in our Milky Way is consistent with that of the resolvable sources with LISA. |

|**Abstract**| We present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) K-band (19 GHz) observations of the redshifted CO(1-0) line emission toward the radio galaxy TN J0924$-$2201 at $z=5.2$, which is one of the most distant CO-detected radio galaxies. With the angular resolution of $\sim2''$, the CO(1-0) line emission is resolved into three clumps, within $\pm500$ km\,s$^{-1}$ relative to its redshift, where is determined by Ly$\alpha$. We find that they locate off-center and 12-33 kpc away from the center of the host galaxy, which has counterparts in $HST$ $i$-band, $Spitzer$/IRAC and ALMA Band-6 (230 GHz; 1.3 mm). With the ALMA detection, we estimate $L_{\rm IR}$ and SFR of the host galaxy to be $(9.3\pm1.7)\times10^{11} L_{\odot}$ and $110\pm20$ $M_{\odot}\,\rm yr^{-1}$, respectively. We also derive the $3\sigma$ upper limit of $M_{\rm H_{2}}<1.3\times10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$ at the host galaxy. The detected CO(1-0) line luminosities of three clumps, $L'_{\rm CO(1-0)}$ = (3.2-4.7)$\times10^{10}$ $\rm\,K\,km\,s^{-1}pc^{2}$, indicate the presence of three massive molecular gas reservoirs with $M_{\rm H_{2}}$ = (2.5-3.7)$\times10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$, by assuming the CO-to-H$_{2}$ conversion factor $\alpha_{\rm CO} = 0.8$ $M_{\rm \odot}\rm\,(K\,km\,s^{-1}pc^{2})^{-1}$, although the star formation rate (SFR) is not elevated because of the non-detection of ALMA 1.3 mm continuum (SFR $<$ 40 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$). From the host galaxy, the nearest molecular gas clump labeled as clump A, is apparently aligning with the radio jet axis, showing the radio-CO alignment. The possible origin of these three clumps around TN J0924$-$2201 can be interpreted as merger, jet-induced metal enrichment and outflow. |

|**Abstract**| Short gamma-ray bursts are associated with binary neutron star mergers, which are multimessenger astronomical events that have been observed both in gravitational waves and in the multiband electromagnetic spectrum. Depending on the masses of the stars in the binary and on details of their largely unknown equation of state, a dynamically evolving and short-lived neutron star may be formed after the merger, existing for approximately 10-300 ms before collapsing to a black hole. Numerical relativity simulations across different groups consistently show broad power spectral features in the 1-5 kHz range in the post-merger gravitational wave signal, which is inaccessible by current gravitational-wave detectors but could be seen by future third generation ground-based detectors in the next decade. This implies the possibility of quasiperiodic modulation of the emitted gamma-rays in a subset of events where a neutron star is formed shortly prior to the final collapse to a black hole. Here we present two such signals identified in the short bursts GRB 910711 and GRB 931101B from archival BATSE data, which are compatible with the predictions from numerical relativity. |

|**Abstract**| In this series of papers we present an emulator-based halo model for the non-linear clustering of galaxies in modified gravity cosmologies. In the first paper, we present emulators for the following halo properties: the halo mass function, concentration-mass relation and halo-matter cross-correlation function. The emulators are trained on data extracted from the \textsc{FORGE} and \textsc{BRIDGE} suites of $N$-body simulations, respectively for two modified gravity (MG) theories: $f(R)$ gravity and the DGP model, varying three standard cosmological parameters $\Omega_{\mathrm{m0}}, H_0, \sigma_8$, and one MG parameter, either $\bar{f}_{R0}$ or $r_{\mathrm{c}}$. Our halo property emulators achieve an accuracy of $\lesssim 1\%$ on independent test data sets. We demonstrate that the emulators can be combined with a galaxy-halo connection prescription to accurately predict the galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-matter correlation functions using the halo model framework. |

|**Abstract**| Weak gravitational lensing is one of the most important probes of the nature of dark matter and dark energy. In order to extract cosmological information from next-generation weak lensing surveys (e.g., Euclid, Roman, LSST, and CSST) as much as possible, accurate measurements of weak lensing shear are required. In this work, we present a fully deep-learning-based approach to measuring weak lensing shear accurately. Our approach comprises two modules. The first one contains a CNN with two branches for taking galaxy images and PSF simultaneously, and the output of this module includes the galaxy's magnitude, size, and shape. The second module includes a multiple-layer Neural Network to calibrate weak lensing shear measurements. We name the program Forklens and make it publicly available online. Applying Forklens to CSST-like mock images, we achieve consistent accuracy with traditional approaches (such as moment-based measurement and forward model fitting) on the sources with high signal-to-noise ratios (S/N). For the sources with meagre S/N, Forklens exhibits powerful latent denoising ability and offers accurate predictions on galaxy shapes. The final shear measurements with Forklens deliver a multiplicative bias $m=-0.4\pm3.0\times10^{-3}$ and an additive bias $c=-0.5\pm1.9\times10^{-4}$. Our tests with CSST-like simulation show that Forklens is competitive with other shear measurement algorithms such as Metacalibration, while Forklens can potentially lower the S/N limit. Moreover, the whole procedure of Forklens is automated and costs about 0.6 milliseconds per galaxy, which is appropriate to adequately take advantage of the sky coverage and depth of the upcoming weak lensing surveys. |

|**Abstract**| As an exact result required by the Etherington reciprocity theorem, the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), $\eta(z)=D_L(z)(1+z)^{-2}/D_A(z)=1$ plays an essential part in modern cosmology. In this paper, we present a new method ($\eta(z_i)/\eta(z_j)$) to use the measurements of ultra-compact structure in radio quasars (QSO) and the latest observations of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) to test CDDR. By taking the observations directly from SN Ia and QSOs, one can completely eliminate the uncertainty caused by the calibration of the absolute magnitudes of standard candles ($M_B$) and the linear sizes of standard rulers ($l_m$). Benefit from the absence of nuisance parameters involved in other currently available methods, our analysis demonstrates no evidence for the deviation and redshift evolution of CDDR up to $z=2.3$. The combination of our methodology and the machine learning Artificial Neural Network (ANN) would produce $10^{-3}$ level constraints on the violation parameter at high redshifts. Our results indicate perfect agreement between observations and predictions, supporting the persisting claims that the Etherington reciprocity theorem could still be the best description of our universe. |

|**Abstract**| The cosmological principle states that the Universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic at large distance scales. There currently exist many observations which indicate a departure from this principle. It has been shown that many of these observations can be explained by invoking superhorizon cosmological perturbations and may be consistent with the Big Bang paradigm. Remarkably, these modes simultaneously explain the observed Hubble tension, i.e., the discrepancy between the direct and indirect measurements of the Hubble parameter. We propose several tests of the cosmological principle using SKA. In particular, we can reliably extract the signal of dipole anisotropy in the distribution of radio galaxies. The superhorizon perturbations also predict a significant redshift dependence of the dipole signal which can be nicely tested by the study of signals of reionization and the dark ages using SKA. We also propose to study the alignment of radio galaxy axes as well as their integrated polarization vectors over distance scales ranging from a few Mpc to Gpc. We discuss data analysis techniques that can reliably extract these signals from data. |

|*Appeared on*| *2023-01-10*|

|**Abstract**| In this work, we investigate the existence of neutron stars (NS) in the framework of $f(\mathbb{T},\CMcal{T})$ gravity, where $\mathbb{T}$ is the torsion tensor and $\CMcal{T}$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The hydrostatic equilibrium equations are obtained, however, with $p$ and $\rho$ quantities passed on by effective quantities $\Bar{p}$ and $\Bar{\rho}$, whose mass-radius diagrams are obtained using modern equations of state (EoS) of nuclear matter derived from relativistic mean field models and compared with the ones computed by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. Substantial changes in the mass-radius profiles of NS are obtained even for small changes in the free parameter of this modified theory. The results indicate that the use of $f(\mathbb{T},\CMcal{T})$ gravity in the study of NS provides good results for the masses and radii of some important astrophysical objects, as for example, the low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) NGC 6397 and the pulsar of millisecond PSR J0740+6620. In addition, radii results inferred from the Lead Radius EXperiment (PREX-2) can also be described for certain parameter values. |

|**Abstract**| Expected to be of the highest survey power telescope in the northern hemisphere, the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) will begin its routine observations of the northern sky since 2023. WFST will produce a lot of scientific data to support the researches of time-domain astronomy, asteroids and the solar system, galaxy formation and cosmology and so on. We estimated that the 5 $\sigma$ limiting magnitudes of WFST with 30 second exposure are $u=22.31$ mag, $g=23.42$ mag, $r=22.95$ mag, $i=22.43$ mag, $z=21.50$ mag, $w=23.61$ mag. The above values are calculated for the conditions of $airmass=1.2$, seeing = 0.75 arcsec, precipitable water vapour (PWV) = 2.5 mm and Moon-object separation = $45^{\circ}$ at the darkest New Moon night of the Lenghu site (V=22.30 mag, Moon phase $\theta=0^{\circ}$). The limiting magnitudes in different Moon phase conditions are also calculated. The calculations are based on the empirical transmittance data of WFST optics, the vendor provided CCD quantum efficiency, the atmospherical model transmittance and spectrum of the site. In the absence of measurement data such as sky transmittance and spectrum, we use model data. |

|**Abstract**| Saturn's rings are composed of icy grains, most in the mm to m size ranges, undergoing several collisions per orbit. Their collective behaviour generates a remarkable array of structure over many orders of magnitude, much of it not well understood. On the other hand, the collisional properties and parameters of individual ring particles are poorly constrained; usually N-body simulations and kinetic theory employ hard-sphere models with a coefficient of restitution $\epsilon$ that is constant or a decreasing function of impact speed. Due to plastic deformation of surface regolith, however, it is likely that $\epsilon$ will be more complicated, at the very least a non-monotonic function. We undertake N-body simulations with the REBOUND code with non-monotonic $\epsilon$ laws to approximate surfaces that are friable but not sticking. Our simulations reveal that such ring models can support two thermally stable steady states for the same (dynamical) optical depth: a cold and a warm state. If the ring breaks up into radial bands of one or the other state, we find that warmer states tend to migrate into the colder states via a coherent travelling front. We also find stationary `viscous' fronts, which connect states of different optical depth, but the same angular momentum flux. We discuss these preliminary results and speculate on their implications for structure formation in Saturn's B and C-rings, especially with respect to structures that appear in Cassini images but not in occultations. |

|**Abstract**| Observations of the first billion years of cosmic history are currently limited. We demonstrate the synergy between observations of the sky-averaged 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen and interferometric measurements of the corresponding spatial fluctuations. By jointly analysing data from SARAS3 (redshift $z\approx15-25$) and limits from HERA ($z\approx8$ and $10$), we produce the tightest constraints to date on the astrophysics of galaxies 200 million years after the Big Bang. We disfavour at $95\%$ confidence scenarios in which power spectra are $\geq126$ mK$^{2}$ at $z=25$ and the sky-averaged signals are $\leq-277$ mK. |

|**Abstract**| In this work, we used N-body simulations and a radiative transfer package to model the evolution of eccentric debris discs produced by giant impacts between planetary embryos. This included how the morphology and infrared emission of these discs varied with embryo eccentricity and collision true anomaly. We found that eccentric discs inherit the eccentric properties of the centre of mass orbit of the two colliding embryos. However, the orientation of the collision with the respect to this orbit plays a key role in determining how closely the disc material resembles the centre of mass orbit. Additionally, we found that increased eccentricity acted to suppress the formation of certain short-term variations in the disc emission depending on the collision position. These short-term variations have been associated with an observational phenomenon called extreme debris discs. Short-term variability has been suggested as a potential signature for giant impacts. |

|**Abstract**| With over 5,000 exoplanets currently detected, there is a need for a primary classification method to prioritise candidates for biosignature observations. Here, we develop a classification method to categorise rocky exoplanets based on their closest solar system analogue using available data of observed stellar and planetary features, masses, and radii, to model non-thermal atmospheric escape, thermal atmospheric escape, and stellar irradiation boundaries. Applying this classification method to the 720 rocky exoplanets in our sample with uncertainties in planetary masses, radii, stellar temperatures, and fluxes propagated via a Monte Carlo model indicates that 22% $\pm$ 8% are Mercury analogues, 39% $\pm$ 4% are Mars analogues, 11% $\pm$ 1% are Venus analogues, 2% $\pm$ 1% are Earth analogues, and 26% $\pm$ 12% are without a known planetary counterpart in our solar system. Extrapolating to conditions on LHS 3844b and GJ 1252b, our classification method gives results reasonably consistent with current observations. Subsequently, to demonstrate the functionality of this classification method, we plot our catalogued sample of exoplanets on an adjusted surface pressure versus temperature phase diagram, presenting more realistic estimates of the potential surface phases (gas, liquid or ice). Our new classification method could help target selection for future exoplanet characterisation missions. |

|**Abstract**| A major goal in the search for extraterrestrial life is the detection of liquid water on the surface of exoplanets. On terrestrial planets, volcanic outgassing is a significant source of atmospheric and surface water and a major contributor to the long-term evolution of the atmosphere. The rate of volcanism depends on the interior evolution and on numerous feedback processes between atmosphere and interior, which continuously shape atmospheric composition, pressure, and temperature. We present the results of a comprehensive 1D model of the coupled evolution of the interior and atmosphere of rocky exoplanets that combines central feedback processes between these two reservoirs. We carried out more than 280,000 simulations over a wide range of mantle redox states and volatile content, planetary masses, interior structures and orbital distances in order to robustly assess the emergence, accumulation and preservation of surface water on rocky planets. To establish a conservative baseline of which types of planets can outgas and sustain water on their surface, we focus here on stagnant-lid planets. We find that only a narrow range of the mantle redox state around the iron-w\"ustite buffer allows forming atmospheres that lead to long-term habitable conditions. At oxidizing conditions similar to those of the Earth's mantle, most stagnant-lid planets transition into a runaway greenhouse regime akin to Venus due to strong CO$_2$ outgassing. At more reducing conditions, the amount of outgassed greenhouse gases is often too low to keep surface water from freezing. In addition, Mercury-like planets with large metallic cores are able to sustain habitable conditions at an extended range of orbital distances as a result of lower volcanic activity. |

|**Abstract**| We present the results obtained with an end-to-end simulator of an Extreme Adaptive Optics (XAO) system control loop. It is used to predict its on-sky performances and to optimise the AO loop algorithms. It was first used to validate a novel analytical model of the fitting error, a limit due to the Deformable Mirror (DM) shape. Standard analytical models assume a sharp correction under the DM cutoff frequency, disregarding the transition between the AO corrected and turbulence dominated domains. Our model account for the influence function shape in this smooth transition. Then, it is well-known that Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors (SH-WFS) have a limited spatial bandwidth, the high frequencies of the wavefront being seen as low frequencies. We show that this aliasing error can be partially compensated (both in terms of Strehl ratio and contrast) by adding priors on the turbulence statistics in the framework of an inverse problem approach. This represents an alternative to the standard additional optical filter used in XAO systems. In parallel to this numerical work, a bench was aligned to experimentally test the AO system and these new algorithms comprising a DM192 ALPAO deformable mirror and a 15x15 SH-WFS. We present the predicted performances of the AO loop based on end-to-end simulations. |

|**Abstract**| The CHIME/FRB project has detected hundreds of fast radio bursts (FRBs), providing an unparalleled population to probe statistically the foreground media that they illuminate. One such foreground medium is the ionized halo of the Milky Way (MW). We estimate the total Galactic electron column density from FRB dispersion measures (DMs) as a function of Galactic latitude using four different estimators, including ones that assume spherical symmetry of the ionized MW halo and ones that imply more latitudinal-variation in density. Our observation-based constraints of the total Galactic DM contribution for $|b|\geq 30^\circ$, depending on the Galactic latitude and selected model, span 87.8 - 141 pc cm^-3. This constraint implies upper limits on the MW halo DM contribution that range over 52-111 pc cm^-3. We discuss the viability of various gas density profiles for the MW halo that have been used to estimate the halo's contribution to DMs of extragalactic sources. Several models overestimate the DM contribution, especially when assuming higher halo gas masses (~ 3.5 x 10^12 solar masses). Some halo models predict a higher MW halo DM contribution than can be supported by our observations unless the effect of feedback is increased within them, highlighting the impact of feedback processes in galaxy formation. |

|**Abstract**| The First Ionization Potential (FIP) bias, whereby elemental abundances for low FIP elements in different coronal structures vary from their photospheric values and may also vary with time, has been widely studied. In order to study the temporal variation, and to understand the physical mechanisms giving rise to the FIP bias, we have investigated the hot cores of three ARs using disk-integrated soft X-ray spectroscopic observation with the Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM) onboard Chandrayaan-2. Observations for periods when only one AR was present on the solar disk were used so as to ensure that the AR was the principal contributor to the total X-ray intensity. The average values of temperature and EM were ~3 MK and 3.0E46/cm3 respectively. Regardless of the age and activity of the AR, the elemental abundances of the low FIP elements, Al, Mg, and Si were consistently higher than their photospheric values. The average FIP bias for Mg and Si was ~3, whereas the FIP bias for the mid-FIP element, S, was ~1.5. However, the FIP bias for the lowest FIP element, Al, was observed to be higher than 3, which, if real, suggests a dependence of the FIP bias of low FIP elements on their FIP value. Another major result from our analysis is that the FIP bias of these elements is established in within ~10 hours of emergence of the AR and then remains almost constant throughout its lifetime. |

|**Abstract**| Launched on 12 Aug. 2018, NASA's Parker Solar Probe had completed 13 of its scheduled 24 orbits around the Sun by Nov. 2022. The mission's primary science goal is to determine the structure and dynamics of the Sun's coronal magnetic field, understand how the solar corona and wind are heated and accelerated, and determine what processes accelerate energetic particles. Parker Solar Probe returned a treasure trove of science data that far exceeded quality, significance, and quantity expectations, leading to a significant number of discoveries reported in nearly 700 peer-reviewed publications. The first four years of the 7-year primary mission duration have been mostly during solar minimum conditions with few major solar events. Starting with orbit 8 (i.e., 28 Apr. 2021), Parker flew through the magnetically dominated corona, i.e., sub-Alfv\'enic solar wind, which is one of the mission's primary objectives. In this paper, we present an overview of the scientific advances made mainly during the first four years of the Parker Solar Probe mission, which go well beyond the three science objectives that are: (1) Trace the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the solar corona and solar wind; (2) Determine the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind; and (3) Explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. |

|**Abstract**| We present a statistical study of a sample of 17 hub-filament-system (HFS) clouds of high-mass star formation using high-angular resolution ($\sim$1-2 arcsecond) ALMA 1.3mm and 3mm continuum data. The sample includes 8 infrared (IR)-dark and 9 IR-bright types, which correspond to an evolutionary sequence from the IR-dark to IR-bright stage. The central massive clumps and their associated most massive cores are observed to follow a trend of increasing mass ($M$) and mass surface density ($\Sigma$) with evolution from IR-dark to IR-bright stage. In addition, a mass-segregated cluster of young stellar objects (YSOs) are revealed in both IR-dark and IR-bright HFSs with massive YSOs located in the hub and the population of low-mass YSOs distributed over larger areas. Moreover, outflow feedback in all HFSs are found to escape preferentially through the inter-filamentary diffuse cavities, suggesting that outflows would render a limited effect on the disruption of the HFSs and ongoing high-mass star formation therein. From the above observations, we suggest that high-mass star formation in the HFSs can be described by a multi-scale mass accretion/transfer scenario, from hub-composing filaments through clumps down to cores, that can naturally lead to a mass-segregated cluster of stars. |

|**Abstract**| JWST has begun its scientific mission, which includes the atmospheric characterization of transiting exoplanets. Some of the first exoplanets to be observed by JWST have equilibrium temperatures below 1000 K, which is a regime where photochemical hazes are expected to form. The optical properties of these hazes, which controls how they interact with light, are critical for interpreting exoplanet observations, but relevant data are not available. Here we measure the optical properties of organic haze analogues generated in water-rich exoplanet atmosphere experiments. We report optical constants (0.4 to 28.6 micron) of organic hazes for current and future observational and modeling efforts covering the entire wavelength range of JWST instrumentation and a large part of Hubble. We use these optical constants to generate hazy model atmospheric spectra. The synthetic spectra show that differences in haze optical constants have a detectable effect on the spectra, impacting our interpretation of exoplanet observations. This study emphasizes the need to investigate the optical properties of hazes formed in different exoplanet atmospheres, and establishes a practical procedure to determine such properties. |
