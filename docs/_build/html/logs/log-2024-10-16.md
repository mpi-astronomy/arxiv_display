|**Abstract**|            With a temperature of $\sim 285$ K WISE0855 is the coldest brown dwarf observed so far. Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) we obtained observations that allow us to characterize WISE0855s atmosphere focusing on vertical variation in the water steam abundance, measuring trace gas abundances and receiving bulk parameters for this cold object. We observed the ultra cool dwarf WISE0855 using the Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS) onboard JWST at a spectral resolution of up to 3750. We combined the observation with published data from the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) G395M and PRISM modes yielding a spectrum ranging from 0.8 to 22 um. We apply atmospheric retrievals using petitRADTRANS to measure atmospheric abundances, the pressure-temperature structure, radius and gravity of the brown dwarf. We also employ publicly available clear and cloudy self-consistent grid models to estimate bulk properties of the atmosphere such as the effective temperature, radius, gravity and metallicity. Atmospheric retrievals constrain a variable water abundance profile in the atmosphere, as predicted by equilibrium chemistry. We detect the 15NH3 isotopologue and infer a ratio of mass fraction of 14NH3/15NH3 = 332+63-43 for the clear retrieval. We measure the bolometric luminosity by integrating the presented spectrum and obtain a value of log(L/L$_{\odot}$) = -7.291+/-0.008. The detected water depletion indicates that water condenses out in the upper atmosphere due to the very low effective temperature of WISE0855. The height in the atmosphere where this occurs is covered by the MIRI/MRS data, and thus demonstrates the potential of MIRI to characterize cold gas giants atmospheres. Comparing the data to retrievals and self-consistent grid models, we do not detect signs for water ice clouds, although their spectral features have been predicted in previous studies.         |

|**Abstract**|            Classifying and summarizing large data sets from different sky survey projects is essential for various subsequent scientific research. By combining data from 4XMM-DR13, SDSS DR18, and CatWISE, we formed an XMM-WISE-SDSS sample that included information in the X-ray, optical, and infrared bands. By cross-matching this sample with datasets from known spectral classifications from SDSS and LAMOST, we obtained a training dataset containing stars, galaxies, quasars, and Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). Two machine learning methods, CatBoost and Self-Paced Ensemble (SPE), were used to train and construct machine learning models through training sets to classify the XMM-WISE-SDSS sample. Notably, the SPE classifier showed excellent performance in YSO classification, identifying 1102 YSO candidates from 160,545 sources, including 258 known YSOs. Then we further verify whether these candidates are YSOs by the spectra in LAMOST and the identification in the SIMBAD and VizieR dabtabases. Finally there are 412 unidentified YSO candidates. The discovery of these new YSOs is an important addition to existing YSO samples and will deepen our understanding of star formation and evolution. Moreover we provided a classification catalog for the whole XMM-WISE-SDSS sample.         |

|**Abstract**|            Stellar ultraviolet (UV) emission serves as a crucial indicator for estimating magnetic activity and evaluating the habitability of exoplanets orbiting stars. In this paper, we present a straightforward method to derive stellar photospheric UV emission for F to M main-sequence stars. By using PARSEC models, we establish relations between near-UV (NUV) and far-UV (FUV) magnitudes from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), NUV magnitudes from the China Space Station Telescope, and stellar effective temperatures and Gaia BP$-$RP color for different metallicities. Together with the observed sample, we find that for NUV emission, the photospheric contribution to the observed flux is less than 20% for M stars, around 10% to 70% for G stars, and ranges from 30% to 85% for G and F stars. For FUV emission, the photospheric contribution is less than $10^{-6}$ for M stars, below $10^{-4}$ for K stars, around $10^{-4}$ to 10% for G stars, and between 6% and 50% for F stars. Our work enables the simple and effective determination of stellar excess UV emission and the exploration of magnetic activity.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the first results of the JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS). Utilising the first NIRCam narrow-band imaging at 4.7$\mu$m, over 63 arcmin$^{2}$ in the PRIMER/COSMOS field, we have identified 609 emission line galaxy candidates. From these, we robustly selected 35 H$\alpha$ star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 6.1$, with H$\alpha$ star-formation rates ($\rm{SFR_{H\alpha}}$) of $\sim0.9-15\ \rm{M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}$. Combining our unique H$\alpha$ sample with the exquisite panchromatic data in the field, we explore their physical properties and star-formation histories, and compare these to a broad-band selected sample at $z\sim 6$ to offer vital new insight into the nature of high-redshift galaxies. UV-continuum slopes ($\beta$) are considerably redder for our H$\alpha$ sample ($\langle\beta\rangle\sim-1.92$) compared to the broad-band sample ($\langle\beta\rangle\sim-2.35$). This is not due to dust attenuation as our H$\alpha$ sample is relatively dust-poor (median $A_V=0.23$); instead, we argue that the reddened slopes could be due to nebular continuum. We compared $\rm{SFR_{H\alpha}}$ and the UV-continuum-derived $\rm{SFR_{UV}}$ to SED-fitted measurements averaged over canonical timescales of 10 and 100 Myr ($\rm{SFR_{10}}$ and $\rm{SFR_{100}}$). We find an increase in recent SFR for our sample of H$\alpha$ emitters, particularly at lower stellar masses ($<10^9 \rm{M_{\odot}}$). We also find that $\rm{SFR_{H\alpha}}$ strongly traces SFR averaged over 10 Myr timescales, whereas the UV-continuum over-predicts SFR on 100 Myr timescales at low stellar masses. These results point to our H$\alpha$ sample undergoing `bursty' star formation. Our F356W $z \sim 6$ sample show a larger scatter in $\rm{SFR_{10}/SFR_{100}}$ across all stellar masses, highlighting how narrow-band photometric selections of H$\alpha$ emitters are key to quantifying the burstiness of star-formation activity.         |

|**Abstract**|            The precise Doppler method for measuring stellar radial velocities (RV) is a fundamental technique in modern astronomy. This method records a star's spectrum and detects periodic Doppler shifts in its spectral features, which indicate the gravitational influences induced by orbiting companions. The Doppler technique has yielded remarkable successes in exoplanet detection, uncovering a diverse array of planetary systems ranging from hot Jupiters to Neptune-mass planets and super-Earths. Having led to the discovery of over 1100 exoplanets, the RV method is the most effective approach for measuring orbital geometries and minimum masses, which are of fundamental importance when accessing planet formation and evolution scenarios. However, exoplanet detection via precise RV measurements poses significant challenges, including managing various sources of interference, such as instrumental errors, and mitigating spurious Doppler shifts induced by phenomena like stellar activity. Key to this technique's advancement is instrumental calibration methods, notably precise calibration methods and ultra-stable spectrographs. This technique holds promise in systematically exploring the domain of Jovian analogs, rocky and icy planets within the habitable zones of their parent stars, and providing crucial follow-up observations for transiting candidates detected by space missions. The synergy between transit and Doppler measurements of exoplanets, when feasible, has provided a comprehensive set of orbital and physical parameters for exoplanets, such as the dynamical mass and mean planet density, which is enhancing our understanding of their internal composition. Additionally, ongoing efforts aim to improve the RV technique further by developing more stable calibration techniques aimed at detecting Earth-like analogs around Solar-type stars that require cm/s RV precision.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the discovery of TOI-7041 b (TIC 201175570 b), a hot Saturn transiting a red giant star with measurable stellar oscillations. We observe solar-like oscillations in TOI-7041 with a frequency of maximum power of $\nu_{\rm max} = 218.50\pm2.23$ $\mu$Hz and a large frequency separation of $\Delta\nu = 16.5282\pm0.0186$ $\mu$Hz. Our asteroseismic analysis indicates that TOI-7041 has a radius of $4.10 \pm 0.06$(stat) $\pm$ 0.05(sys) $R_\odot$, making it one of the largest stars around which a transiting planet has been discovered with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and the mission's first oscillating red giant with a transiting planet. TOI-7041 b has an orbital period of $9.691 \pm 0.006$ days and a low eccentricity of $e = 0.04 \pm 0.04$. We measure a planet radius of $1.02 \pm 0.03$ $R_J$ with photometry from TESS, and a planet mass of $0.36 \pm 0.16$ $M_J$ ($114 \pm 51$ $M_\oplus$) with ground-based radial velocity measurements. TOI-7041 b appears less inflated than similar systems receiving equivalent incident flux, and its circular orbit indicates that it is not undergoing tidal heating due to circularization. The asteroseismic analysis of the host star provides some of the tightest constraints on stellar properties for a TESS planet host and enables precise characterization of the hot Saturn. This system joins a small number of TESS-discovered exoplanets orbiting stars that exhibit clear stellar oscillations and indicates that extended TESS observations of evolved stars will similarly provide a path to improved exoplanet characterization.         |
