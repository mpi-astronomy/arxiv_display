|**Abstract**|            We present the largest extragalactic survey of supernova remnant (SNR) candidates in nearby star-forming galaxies using exquisite spectroscopic maps from MUSE. Supernova remnants exhibit distinctive emission-line ratios and kinematic signatures, which are apparent in optical spectroscopy. Using optical integral field spectra from the PHANGS-MUSE project, we identify SNRs in 19 nearby galaxies at ~ 100~pc scales. We use five different optical diagnostics: (1) line ratio maps of [SII]/H$\alpha$; (2) line ratio maps of [OI]/H$\alpha$; (3) velocity dispersion map of the gas; (4) and (5) two line ratio diagnostic diagrams from BPT diagrams to identify and distinguish SNRs from other nebulae. Given that our SNRs are seen in projection against HII regions and diffuse ionized gas, in our line ratio maps we use a novel technique to search for objects with [SII]/H$\alpha$ or [OI]/H$\alpha$ in excess of what is expected at fixed H$\alpha$ surface brightness within photoionized gas. In total, we identify 2,233 objects using at least one of our diagnostics, and define a subsample of 1,166 high-confidence SNRs that have been detected with at least two diagnostics. The line ratios of these SNRs agree well with the MAPPINGS shock models, and we validate our technique using the well-studied nearby galaxy M83, where all SNRs we found are also identified in literature catalogs and we recover 51% of the known SNRs. The remaining 1,067 objects in our sample are detected with only one diagnostic and we classify them as SNR candidates. We find that ~ 35% of all our objects overlap with the boundaries of HII regions from literature catalogs, highlighting the importance of using indicators beyond line intensity morphology to select SNRs. [OI]/H$\alpha$ line ratio is responsible for selecting the most objects (1,368; 61%), (abridged).         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a study of the growth of the quiescent galaxy population between 0.5 < z < 3 by tracing the number density and structural evolution of a sample of 4518 old and 583 young quiescent galaxies with log($M_*$/$M_{\odot}$)>10.4, selected from the COSMOS2020 catalog with complementary HST/F160W imaging from the 3D-DASH survey. Among the quiescent population at z$\sim$2, roughly 50% are recently quenched galaxies; these young quiescent galaxies become increasingly rare towards lower redshift, supporting the idea that the peak epoch of massive galaxy quenching occurred at z>2. Our data show that while the effective half-light radii of quiescent galaxies generally increases with time, young quiescent galaxies are significantly smaller than their older counterparts at the same redshift. In this work we investigate the connection between this size difference and other structural properties, including axis ratios, color gradients, stellar mass, and the intrinsic scatter in effective radii. We demonstrate that the size difference is driven by the most massive sub-population (log($M_*$/$M_{\odot}$)>11) and does not persist when restricting the sample to intermediate mass galaxies (10.4<log($M_*$/$M_{\odot}$)<11). Interestingly, the intrinsic scatter in physical size shows a strong co-evolution over the investigated time period and peaks around z$\sim$2 for both populations, only diverging at z < 1. Taken together, and assuming we are not missing a significant population of lower surface brightness galaxies, while the formation and quenching mechanisms that dominate at higher redshifts yield compact remnants, multiple evolutionary pathways may explain the diverse morphologies of galaxies that quench at z<1.         |
