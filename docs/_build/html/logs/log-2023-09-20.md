|**Abstract**| The presence of a stellar bar in a disc galaxy indicates that the galaxy hosts a dynamically settled disc and that bar-driven processes are taking place in shaping the evolution of the galaxy. Studying the cosmic evolution of the bar fraction in disc galaxies is therefore essential to understand galaxy evolution in general. Previous studies have found, using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), that the bar fraction significantly declines from the local Universe to redshifts near one. Using the first four pointings from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) and the initial public observations for the Public Release Imaging for Extragalactic Research (PRIMER), we extend the studies on the bar fraction in disc galaxies to redshifts $1 \leq z \leq 3$, i.e., for the first time beyond redshift two. We only use galaxies that are also present in the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) on the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) and Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) HST observations. An optimised sample of 768 close-to-face-on galaxies is visually classified to find the fraction of bars in disc galaxies in two redshift bins: $1 \leq z \leq 2$ and $2 < z \leq 3$. The bar fraction decreases from $\sim 18.9^{+ 9.7}_{- 9.4}$ per cent to $\sim 6.6^{+ 7.1}_{- 5.9}$ per cent (from the lower to the higher redshift bin), but is $\sim 3 - 4$ times greater than the bar fraction found in previous studies using bluer HST filters. Our results show that bar-driven evolution commences at early cosmic times and that dynamically settled discs are already present at a lookback time of $\sim 11$ Gyrs. |

|**Abstract**| (abridged) We study and compare the warm (>100 K) and cold (<100 K) material toward the high-mass star-forming region IRAS 23385+6053 (IRAS 23385 hereafter) combining high angular resolution observations in the mid-infrared (MIR) with the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS) project and with the NOEMA at mm wavelengths at angular resolutions of 0.2"-1". The spatial morphology of atomic and molecular species is investigated by line integrated intensity maps. The temperature and column density of different gas components is estimated using H2 transitions (warm and hot component) and a series of CH3CN transitions as well as 3 mm continuum emission (cold component). Toward the central dense core in IRAS 23385 the material consists of relatively cold gas and dust (~50 K), while multiple outflows create heated and/or shocked H2 and show enhanced temperatures (~400 K) along the outflow structures. An energetic outflow with enhanced emission knots of [Fe II] and [Ni II] hints at J-type shocks, while two other outflows have enhanced emission of only H2 and [S I] caused by C-type shocks. The latter two outflows are also more prominent in molecular line emission at mm wavelengths (e.g., SiO, SO, H2CO, and CH3OH). Even higher angular resolution data are needed to unambiguously identify the outflow driving sources given the clustered nature of IRAS 23385. While most of the forbidden fine structure transitions are blueshifted, [Ne II] and [Ne III] peak at the source velocity toward the MIR source A/mmA2 suggesting that the emission is originating from closer to the protostar. |

|| L. Wan, <mark>X. Zhang</mark>, J. D. Hofgartner |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-09-20*|

|**Abstract**| The rotational lightcurves of the Pluto-Charon system were previously believed to be solely attributed to their surfaces. However, a proposed scenario of haze cooling \citep{2017Natur.551..352Z} suggests that the atmospheric haze of Pluto could significantly contribute to mid-infrared emission, which calls for a revisit of previous analyses. In this study, we employ a Bayesian retrieval approach to constrain the haze emission from the rotational lightcurves of the Pluto-Charon system. The lightcurves were observed by the Spitzer and Herschel telescopes at 24 and 70 $\mu$m, and were combined with the latest surface albedo maps of Pluto and Charon from the New Horizons spacecraft. Our results show that including the haze emission is consistent with all current observations, with the best-fit haze flux around 1.63 mJy. This is in agreement with the composition of Titan-like tholins. However, the ``surface only" scenario, which excludes the haze contribution, can still explain the observations. We conclude that the current data at 24 $\mu$m cannot constrain Pluto's haze emission due to the degeneracy with Charon's surface emission. Regardless, some surface properties of Pluto are well constrained by the shape of the lightcurves, with a thermal inertia of approximately 8--10 MKS and a relatively low CH$_4$ emissivity of 0.3--0.5. We suggest that observations by the JWST telescope at 18 $\mu$m, which can resolve Pluto from Charon, could directly probe the haze emission of Pluto due to the low surface emission at that wavelength. |
