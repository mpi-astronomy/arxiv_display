|**Abstract**|            As the most massive nodes of the cosmic web, galaxy clusters represent the best probes of structure formation. Over time, they grow by accreting and disrupting satellite galaxies, adding those stars to the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the intra-cluster light (ICL). However, the formation pathways of different galaxy clusters can vary significantly. To inform upcoming large surveys, we aim to identify observables that can distinguish galaxy cluster formation pathways. Using four different hydrodynamical simulations, Magneticum, TNG100 of IllustrisTNG, Horizon-AGN, and Hydrangea, we study how the fraction of stellar mass in the BCG and ICL ($f_{ICL+BCG}$) relates to the galaxy cluster mass assembly history. For all simulations, $f_{ICL+BCG}$ is the best tracer for the time at which the cluster has accumulated 50% of its mass ($z_{f}$), performing better than other typical dynamical tracers, such as the subhalo mass fraction, the halo mass, and the center shift. More relaxed clusters have higher $f_{ICL+BCG}$, in rare cases up to 90%, while dynamically active clusters have lower fractions, down to 20%, which we find to be independent of the exact implemented baryonic physics. We determine the average increase in $f_{ICL+BCG}$ from stripping and mergers to be between 3-4% per Gyr. $f_{ICL+BCG}$ is tightly traced by the stellar mass ratio between the BCG and both the second (M12) and fourth (M14) most massive cluster galaxy. The average galaxy cluster has assembled half of its halo mass by $z_{f}=0.67$ (about 6 Gyr ago), though individual histories vary significantly from $z_{f}=0.06$ to $z_{f}=1.77$ (0.8 to 10 Gyr ago). As all four cosmological simulations consistently find that $f_{ICL+BCG}$ is an excellent tracer of the cluster dynamical state, upcoming surveys can leverage measurements of $f_{ICL+BCG}$ to statistically quantify the assembly of the most massive structures.         |

|**Abstract**|            Once galaxies settle their discs and become self-gravitating, stellar bars can form, driving the subsequent evolution of their host galaxy. Determining the ages of bars can therefore shed light on the epoch of the onset of secular evolution. In this work, we apply the first broadly applicable methodology to derive bar ages to a sample of 20 nearby galaxies. The method is based on the co-eval build-up of nuclear structures and bars and involves using IFS data from the MUSE instrument on VLT to disentangle the SFH of the nuclear disc from the background population. This allows us to derive the formation epoch of the nuclear disc and, thus, of the bar. We estimate the bar formation epoch of nearby galaxies - mostly from the TIMER survey-, creating the largest sample of galaxies with known bar ages to date. We find bar formation epochs between 1 and 13 Gyr ago, illustrating how disc-settling and bar formation are processes that first took place in the early Universe and are still taking place in some galaxies. We infer the bar fraction over cosmological time with our sample, finding remarkable agreement with that obtained from direct studies of galaxies at high redshifts. Additionally, for the first time, we can investigate secular evolution processes taking into account the ages of bars. Our results agree with the scenario in which bars aid the quenching of the host galaxy, with galaxies hosting older bars tending to be more "quenched". We also find that older bars tend to be longer, stronger, and host larger nuclear discs. Furthermore, we find evidence of the nuclear disc stellar mass build-up over time. On the other hand, we find no evidence of downsizing playing a role in bar formation, since we find that bar age is independent of galaxy stellar mass. With the means to estimate bar ages, we can begin to understand better when and how bars shape the observed properties of disc galaxies.         |

|**Abstract**|            Brown dwarfs at the L-T transition likely experience an inhomogeneous clearing of the clouds in their atmospheres. The resulting surface of thin and thick cloudy patches has been put forward to explain the observed variability, J-band brightening, and re-emergence of FeH absorption. We study the closest brown dwarf binary, Luhman 16A and B, in an effort to constrain their chemical and cloud compositions. As this binary consists of an L7.5 and T0.5 component, we gain insight into the atmospheric properties at the L-T transition. As part of the ESO SupJup Survey, we observed Luhman 16AB at high spectral resolution in the J-band ($1.1-1.4\ \mathrm{\mu m}$) using CRIRES$^+$. To analyse the spectra, we employ an atmospheric retrieval framework, coupling the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS with the MultiNest sampling algorithm. For both objects, we report detections of H$_2$O, K, Na, FeH, and, for the first time in the J-band, hydrogen-fluoride (HF). The K doublet at $1250\ \mathrm{nm}$ shows asymmetric absorption in the blue line wings, which are reproduced via pressure- and temperature-dependent shifts of the line cores. We find evidence for clouds in both spectra and we place constraints on an FeH-depletion in the Luhman 16A photosphere. The inferred over-abundance of FeH for Luhman 16B opposes its predicted rainout into iron clouds. A two-column model, which emulates the patchy surface expected at the L-T transition, is weakly preferred ($\sim 1.8\sigma$) for component B but disfavoured for A ($\sim 5.5\sigma$). The results suggest a uniform surface on Luhman 16A, which is in good agreement with the reduced variability observed for this L-type component. While the presented evidence is not sufficient to draw conclusions about any inhomogeneity on Luhman 16B, future observations covering a broader wavelength range could help to test the cloud-clearing hypothesis.         |

|**Abstract**|            We search for galaxy protoclusters at redshifts $z > 1.5$ in the first data release (Q1) of the $\textit{Euclid}$ survey. We make use of the catalogues delivered by the $\textit{Euclid}$ Science Ground Segment (SGS). After a galaxy selection on the $H_\textrm{E}$ magnitude and on the photometric redshift quality, we undertake the search using the $\texttt{DETECTIFz}$ algorithm, an overdensity finder based on Delaunay tessellation that uses photometric redshift probability distributions through Monte Carlo simulations. In this pilot study, we conduct a search in the 11 $\textit{Euclid}$ tiles that contain previously known $\textit{Planck}$ high star-forming galaxy protocluster candidates and focus on the two detections that coincide with these regions. These counterparts lie at photometric redshifts $z_\textrm{ph}=1.63^{+0.19}_{-0.23}$ and $z_\textrm{ph}=1.56^{+0.18}_{-0.21}$ and have both been confirmed by two other independent protocluster detection algorithms. We study their colours, their derived stellar masses and star-formation rates, and we estimate their halo mass lower limits. We investigate whether we are intercepting these galaxy overdensities in their `dying' phase, such that the high star-formation rates would be due to their last unsustainable starburst before transitioning to groups or clusters of galaxies. Indeed, some galaxy members are found to lie above the main sequence of galaxies (star-formation rate versus stellar mass). These overdense regions occupy a specific position in the dark matter halo mass / redshift plane where forming galaxy clusters are expected to have experienced a transition between cold flows to shock heating in the halo. Finally, we empirically update the potential for galaxy protocluster discoveries at redshift up to $z \simeq3$ (wide survey) and $z \simeq5.5$ (deep survey) with $\textit{Euclid}$ for the next data release (DR1).         |

|**Abstract**|            The International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA)'s second data release (IPTA DR2) combines observations of 65 millisecond pulsars from 7 radio telescopes spanning decades, aiming to detect nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs). IPTA datasets are complex and take years to assemble, often excluding recent data crucial for low-frequency GW searches. To address this, we introduce the ``Lite'' analysis, a framework that informs the full data combination process. Using a Figure of Merit, we first select individual PTA datasets per pulsar, enabling immediate access to new data and providing an early estimate of fully combined dataset results. Applying this method to IPTA DR2, we create an uncombined dataset (DR2 Lite) and an early-combined subset (EDR2) before constructing the final Full DR2 dataset (IPTA DR2). We find that DR2 Lite can detect the common red noise process seen in Full DR2 but overestimates the amplitude as $A = 5.2^{+1.8}_{-1.7} \times 10^{-15}$ at $\gamma = 13/3$, likely due to unmodeled noise. In contrast, the combined datasets improve spectral characterization, with Full DR2 yielding an amplitude of $A = 4.0^{+1.0}_{-0.9} \times 10^{-15}$ at $\gamma = 13/3$. Furthermore, combined datasets yield higher, albeit small, detection statistics for Hellings-Downs correlations. Looking ahead, the Lite method will enable rapid synthesis of the latest PTA data, offering preliminary GW constraints before full dataset combinations are available while also motivating their construction.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Spectrum Roentgen Gamma/eROSITA first public release contains 12,247 clusters and groups. We use the offset between the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) and the X--ray peak (D$_{\rm BCG-X}$) to classify the cluster dynamical state of 3,946 galaxy clusters and groups. The X--ray peaks come from the eROSITA survey while the BCG positions come from the DECaLS DR10 optical data, which includes the DECam eROSITA Survey optical data. We aim to investigate the evolution of the merger and relaxed cluster distributions with redshift and mass, and their impact on the BCG. We model the distribution of D$_{\rm BCG-X}$ as the sum of two Rayleigh distributions representing the cluster's relaxed and disturbed populations, and explore their evolution with redshift and mass. To explore the impact of the cluster's dynamical state on the BCG luminosity, we separate the main sample according to the dynamical state. We define clusters as relaxed if D$_{\rm BCG-X}$ < 0.25$r_{500}$, disturbed if D$_{\rm BCG-X}$>0.5$r_{500}$, and as `diverse' otherwise. We find no evolution of the merging fraction in redshift and mass. We observe that the width of the relaxed distribution to increase with redshift, while the width of the two Rayleigh distributions decreases with mass. The analysis reveals that BCGs in relaxed clusters are brighter than BCGs in both the disturbed and diverse cluster population. The most significant differences are found for high mass clusters at higher redshift. The results suggest that BCGs in low-mass clusters are less centrally bound than those in high-mass systems, irrespective of dynamical state. Over time, BCGs in relaxed clusters progressively align with the potential center. This alignment correlates with their luminosity growth relative to BCGs in dynamically disturbed clusters, underscoring the critical role of the clusters dynamical state in regulating BCG evolution.

|**Abstract**|            We provide an overview of the Jiutian simulations, a hybrid simulation suite for the China Space Survey Telescope (CSST) extragalactic surveys. It consists of four complementary modules: the primary runs with high resolutions under the fiducial concordance cosmology, the emulator runs exploring the parameter uncertainties around the fiducial cosmology, the reconstruction runs intended for recovering the observed Universe site by site, and the extension runs employing extended cosmologies beyond the standard model. For the primary runs, two independent pipelines are adopted to construct subhaloes and merger trees. On top of them, four sets of mock galaxy light-cone catalogs are produced from semi-analytical models and subhalo abundance matching, providing a variety of observational properties including galaxy SED, emission lines, lensing distortions, and mock images. The 129 emulator runs are used to train the CSST emulator, achieving one percent accuracy in predicting a variety of cosmological statistics over $k\leq 10 h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $z\leq 2$. The reconstruction runs employ a number of subgrid baryonic models to predict the evolution and galaxy population of certain regions in the real Universe with constrained initial conditions, enabling controlled investigation of galaxy formation on top of structure formation. The extension runs cover models with warm dark matter, $f(R)$ gravity, interacting dark energy, and nonzero neutrino masses, revealing differences in the cosmic structure under alternative cosmological models. We introduce the specifications for each run, the data products derived from them, the corresponding pipeline developments, and present some main tests. Using the primary runs, we also show that the subhalo peak mass functions of different levels are approximately universal. These simulations form a comprehensive and open library for the CSST surveys.         |

|**Abstract**|            Recent findings from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) favor a dynamical dark energy characterized by a phantom crossing feature. This result also implies a lower value of the Hubble constant, thereby intensifying the so-called Hubble tension. To alleviate the Hubble tension, we consider the early dark energy and explore its impact on the evidence for dynamical dark energy including the Hubble constant calibrated by the SH0ES collaboration. We find that incorporating SH0ES prior with CMB, DESI DR2 BAO and Pantheon Plus/Union3/DESY5 data reduces the preference to dynamical dark energy to $1.8\sigma/1.8\sigma/2.9\sigma$ level, respectively. Our results suggest a potential tension between the Hubble constant $H_0$ of the SH0ES measurement and the phantom-to-quintessence transition in dark energy favored by DESI DR2 BAO data.         |
