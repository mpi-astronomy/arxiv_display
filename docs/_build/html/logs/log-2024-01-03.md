|**Abstract**| We present the UV-to-NIR size evolution of a sample of 161 quiescent galaxies (QGs) with $M_*>10^{10}M_\odot$ over $0.5<z<5$. With deep multi-band NIRCam images in GOODS-South from JADES, we measure the effective radii ($R_e$) of the galaxies at rest-frame 0.3, 0.5 and 1$\mu m$. On average, QGs are 45% (15%) more compact at rest-frame 1$\mu m$ than they are at 0.3$\mu m$ (0.5$\mu m$). Regardless of wavelengths, the $R_e$ of QGs strongly evolves with redshift, and this evolution depends on stellar mass. For lower-mass QGs with $M_*=10^{10}-10^{10.6}M_\odot$, the evolution follows $R_e\sim(1+z)^{-1.1}$, whereas it becomes steeper, following $R_e\sim(1+z)^{-1.7}$, for higher-mass QGs with $M_*>10^{10.6}M_\odot$. To constrain the physical mechanisms driving the apparent size evolution, we study the relationship between $R_e$ and the formation redshift ($z_{form}$) of QGs. For lower-mass QGs, this relationship is broadly consistent with $R_e\sim(1+z_{form})^{-1}$, in line with the expectation of the progenitor effect. For higher-mass QGs, the relationship between $R_e$ and $z_{form}$ depends on stellar age. Older QGs have a steeper relationship between $R_e$ and $z_{form}$ than that expected from the progenitor effect alone, suggesting that mergers and/or post-quenching continuous gas accretion drive additional size growth in very massive systems. We find that the $z>3$ QGs in our sample are very compact, with mass surface densities $\Sigma_e\gtrsim10^{10} M_\odot/\rm{kpc}^2$, and their $R_e$ are possibly even smaller than anticipated from the size evolution measured for lower-redshift QGs. Finally, we take a close look at the structure of GS-9209, one of the earliest confirmed massive QGs at $z_{spec}\sim4.7$. From UV to NIR, GS-9209 becomes increasingly compact, and its light profile becomes more spheroidal, showing that the color gradient is already present in this earliest massive QG. |

|**Abstract**| We study the emission of dust grains within the Orion Bar - a well-known, highly far-UV (FUV)-irradiated PDR. The Orion Bar because of its edge-on geometry provides an exceptional benchmark for characterizing dust evolution and the associated driving processes under varying physical conditions. Our goal is to constrain the local properties of dust by comparing its emission to models. Taking advantage of the recent JWST PDRs4All data, we follow the dust emission as traced by JWST NIRCam (at 3.35 and 4.8 micron) and MIRI (at 7.7, 11.3, 15.0, and 25.5 micron), along with NIRSpec and MRS spectroscopic observations. First, we constrain the minimum size and hydrogen content of carbon nano-grains from a comparison between the observed dust emission spectra and the predictions of the THEMIS dust model coupled to the numerical code DustEM. Using this dust model, we then perform 3D radiative transfer simulations of dust emission with the SOC code and compare to data obtained along well chosen profiles across the Orion Bar. The JWST data allows us, for the first time, to spatially resolve the steep variation of dust emission at the illuminated edge of the Orion Bar PDR. By considering a dust model with carbonaceous nano-grains and submicronic coated silicate grains, we derive unprecedented constraints on the properties of across the Orion Bar. To explain the observed emission profiles with our simulations, we find that the nano-grains must be strongly depleted with an abundance (relative to the gas) 15 times less than in the diffuse ISM. The NIRSpec and MRS spectroscopic observations reveal variations in the hydrogenation of the carbon nano-grains. The lowest hydrogenation levels are found in the vicinity of the illuminating stars suggesting photo-processing while more hydrogenated nano-grains are found in the cold and dense molecular region, potentially indicative of larger grains. |
