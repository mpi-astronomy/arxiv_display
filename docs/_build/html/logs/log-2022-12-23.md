|**Abstract**| We develop a method to identify and determine the physical properties of stellar associations using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) NUV-U-B-V-I imaging of nearby galaxies from the PHANGS-HST survey. We apply a watershed algorithm to density maps constructed from point source catalogues Gaussian smoothed to multiple physical scales from 8 to 64 pc. We develop our method on two galaxies that span the distance range in the PHANGS-HST sample: NGC 3351 (10 Mpc), NGC 1566 (18 Mpc). We test our algorithm with different parameters such as the choice of detection band for the point source catalogue (NUV or V), source density image filtering methods, and absolute magnitude limits. We characterise the properties of the resulting multi-scale associations, including sizes, number of tracer stars, number of associations, photometry, as well as ages, masses, and reddening from Spectral Energy Distribution fitting. Our method successfully identifies structures that occupy loci in the UBVI colour-colour diagram consistent with previously published catalogues of clusters and associations. The median ages of the associations increases from log(age/yr) = 6.6 to log(age/yr) = 6.9 as the spatial scale increases from 8 pc to 64 pc for both galaxies. We find that the youngest stellar associations, with ages < 3 Myr, indeed closely trace H ii regions in H$\alpha$ imaging, and that older associations are increasingly anti-correlated with the H$\alpha$ emission. Owing to our new method, the PHANGS-HST multi-scale associations provide a far more complete census of recent star formation activity than found with previous cluster and compact association catalogues. The method presented here will be applied to the full sample of 38 PHANGS-HST galaxies. |

|**Abstract**| We present direct constraints on galaxy intrinsic alignments using the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3), the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) and its precursor, the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Our measurements incorporate photometric red sequence (redMaGiC) galaxies from DES with median redshift $z\sim0.2-1.0$, luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from eBOSS at $z\sim0.8$, and also a SDSS-III BOSS CMASS sample at $z\sim0.5$. We measure two point intrinsic alignment correlations, which we fit using a model that includes lensing, magnification and photometric redshift error. Fitting on scales $6<r_{\rm p} < 70$ Mpc$/h$, we make a detection of intrinsic alignments in each sample, at $5\sigma-22\sigma$ (assuming a simple one parameter model for IAs). Using these red samples, we measure the IA-luminosity relation. Our results are statistically consistent with previous results, but offer a significant improvement in constraining power, particularly at low luminosity. With this improved precision, we see detectable dependence on colour between broadly defined red samples. It is likely that a more sophisticated approach than a binary red/blue split, which jointly considers colour and luminosity dependence in the IA signal, will be needed in future. We also compare the various signal components at the best fitting point in parameter space for each sample, and find that magnification and lensing contribute $\sim2-18\%$ of the total signal. As precision continues to improve, it will certainly be necessary to account for these effects in future direct IA measurements. Finally, we make equivalent measurements on a sample of Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) from eBOSS at $z\sim 0.8$. We report a null detection, constraining the IA amplitude (assuming the nonlinear alignment model) to be $A_1=0.07^{+0.32}_{-0.42}$ ($|A_1|<0.78$ at $95\%$ CL). |

|**Abstract**| We present XSHOOTER observations with previous ALMA, MUSE and $HST$ observations to study the nature of radio-jet triggered star formation and the interaction of radio jets with the interstellar medium in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the Abell 1795 cluster. Using $HST$ UV data we determined an ongoing star formation rate of 9.3 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The star formation follows the global Kennicutt-Schmidt law, however, it has a low efficiency compared to circumnuclear starbursts in nearby galaxies with an average depletion time of $\sim$1 Gyr. The star formation and molecular gas are offset by $\sim1$ kpc indicating that stars have decoupled from the gas. We detected an arc of high linewidth in ionized gas where electron densities are elevated by a factor of $\sim$4 suggesting a shock front driven by radio jets or peculiar motion of the BCG. An analysis of nebular emission line flux ratios suggests that the gas is predominantly ionized by star formation with a small contribution from shocks. We also calculated the velocity structure function (VSF) of the ionized and molecular gases using velocity maps to characterize turbulent motion in the gas. The ionized gas VSF suggests that the radio jets are driving supersonic turbulence in the gas. Thus radio jets can not only heat the atmosphere on large scales and may quench star formation on longer timescales while triggering star formation in positive feedback on short timescales of a few million years. |

|**Abstract**| The next-generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) will be a significant enhancement of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) array, with $\sim 10$ new antennas and instrumental upgrades of existing antennas. The increased $uv$-coverage, sensitivity, and frequency coverage allow a wide range of new science opportunities to be explored. The ngEHT Analysis Challenges have been launched to inform development of the ngEHT array design, science objectives, and analysis pathways. For each challenge, synthetic EHT and ngEHT datasets are generated from theoretical source models and released to the challenge participants, who analyze the datasets using image reconstruction and other methods. The submitted analysis results are evaluated with quantitative metrics. In this work, we report on the first two ngEHT Analysis Challenges. These have focused on static and dynamical models of M87* and Sgr A*, and shown that high-quality movies of the extended jet structure of M87* and near-horizon hourly timescale variability of Sgr A* can be reconstructed by the reference ngEHT array in realistic observing conditions, using current analysis algorithms. We identify areas where there is still room for improvement of these algorithms and analysis strategies. Other science cases and arrays will be explored in future challenges. |

|**Abstract**| HESS J1356-645 is considered to be a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with the pulsar PSR J1357-6429. We reanalyze the GeV gamma-ray emission in the direction of HESS J1356-645 with more than 13 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data. The extended gamma-ray emission above 5 GeV is found to be spatially coincident with HESS J1356-645. The spectrum in the energy range of 1 GeV-1 TeV can be described by a power law with an index of $\Gamma=1.51\pm0.10$. The broadband spectrum of HESS J1356-645 can be reproduced by a leptonic model with a broken power-law electronic spectrum. In addition, we found evidence that the morphology of the GeV emission from HESS J1356-645 varies with energy, a behavior which is similar to that of the PWN Vela-X. More broadband observations will be helpful to study the energy-dependent characteristics of HESS J1356-645. |

|**Abstract**| The central regions of galaxies harbouring active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be quite complex, especially at high activity, presenting, besides variability, a variety of phenomena related, e.g. to ionization/excitation mechanisms. A detailed study is necessary in order to understand better those objects. For that reason, we performed a multiwavelength analysis of the nuclear region of the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 7314, using an optical data cube obtained with the Integral Field Unit from the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph, together with Hubble Space Telescope images, X-ray data from the XMM-Newton and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array and radio data from Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array. The goals were to study the nuclear and circumnuclear emission, the emission of the AGN and the gas kinematics. The optical spectrum shows the emission of a Seyfert nucleus, with broad components in the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines, characterising a type 1 AGN, with a spectrum rich in coronal emission lines. The spatial morphology of the [OIII]$\lambda$5007 suggests the presence of an ionization cone, west of the nucleus, meanwhile the east cone seems to be obscured by dust. An extended [FeVII]$\lambda$6087 emission was also detected, which could be possibly explained by a scenario involving photoionization+shocks mechanisms. X-rays analyses showed that there are variations in the flux; however, we did not detect any variations in the column density along the line of sight. Its variability may be a consequence of changes in the AGN accretion rate. |

|| Leaf Swordy, <mark>Heidi Jo Newberg</mark>, Thomas Ditto |

|**Abstract**| We develop the theoretical foundation for primary objective grating (POG) telescopy. In recent years, a wide range of telescope designs that collect the light over a large grating and focus it with a secondary receiving optic that is placed at grazing exodus have been proposed by Thomas D. Ditto, and are sometimes referred to as Dittoscopes. Applications include discovery and characterization of exoplanets, discovery of near-Earth asteroids, and spectroscopic surveys of the sky. These telescopes would have small aerial mass, and therefore provide a path forward to launch large telescopes into space. Because this series of telescope designs departs from traditional telescope designs, it has been difficult to evaluate which applications are most advantageous for this design. Here, we define a new figure of merit, the "modified etendue," that characterizes the photon collection capability of a POG. It is demonstrated that the diffraction limit for observations is determined by the length of the grating. We evaluate the effects of atmospheric seeing for ground-based applications and the disambiguation of position vs. wavelength in the focal plane using a second dispersing element. Finally, some strategies for fully reaping the benefits of POG optical characteristics are discussed. |

|**Abstract**| Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are the thermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (WD) and are well-known as a distance indicator. However, it is still unclear how WDs increase their mass near the Chandrasekhar limit and how the thermonuclear runaway happens. The observational clues associated with these open questions, such as the photometric data within hours to days since the explosion, are scarce. Thus, an essential way is to discover SNe Ia at specific epochs with optimal surveys. The 2.5-m Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) is an upcoming survey facility deployed in western China. In this paper, we assess the detecability of SNe Ia with mock observations of WFST. Followed by the volumetric rate, we generate a spectral series of SNe Ia based on a data-based model and introduce the line-of-sight extinction to calculate the brightness from the observer. By comparing with the detection limit of WFST, which is affected by the observing conditions, we can count the number of SNe Ia discovered by mock WFST observations. We expect that WFST can find more than $3.0\times10^{4}$ pre-maximum SNe Ia within one-year running. In particular, WFST could discover about 45 bright SNe Ia, 99 early-phase SNe Ia, or $1.1\times10^{4}$ well-observed SNe Ia with the hypothesized Wide, Deep, or Medium mode, respectively, suggesting WFST will be an influential facility in time-domain astronomy. |

|**Abstract**| Open clusters (OCs) are regarded as tracers to understand stellar evolution theory and validate stellar models. In this study, we presented a robust approach to identifying OCs. A hybrid method of pyUPMASK and RF is first used to remove field stars and determine more reliable members. An identification model based on the RF algorithm built based on 3714 OC samples from Gaia DR2 and EDR3 is then applied to identify OC candidates. The OC candidates are obtained after isochrone fitting, the advanced stellar population synthesis (ASPS) model fitting, and visual inspection. Using the proposed approach, we revisited 868 candidates and preliminarily clustered them by the friends-of-friends algorithm in Gaia EDR3. Excluding the open clusters that have already been reported, we focused on the remaining 300 unknown candidates. From high to low fitting quality, these unrevealed candidates were further classified into Class A (59), Class B (21), and Class C (220), respectively. As a result, 46 new reliable open cluster candidates among classes A and B are identified after visual inspection. |

|**Abstract**| We present the study of multi-wavelength observations of an unidentified Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) source, 4FGL J1910.7-5320, a new candidate redback millisecond pulsar binary. In the 4FGL 95% error region of 4FGL J1910.7-5320, we find a possible binary with a 8.36-hr orbital period from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS), confirmed by optical spectroscopy using the SOAR telescope. This optical source was recently independently discovered as a redback pulsar by the TRAPUM project, confirming our prediction. We fit the optical spectral energy distributions of 4FGL J1910.7-5320 with a blackbody model, inferring a maximum distance of 4.1 kpc by assuming that the companion fills its Roche-lobe with a radius of R = 0.7R_sun. Using a 12.6 ks Chandra X-ray observation, we identified an X-ray counterpart for 4FGL J1910.7-5320, with a spectrum that can be described by an absorbed power-law with a photon index of 1.0+/-0.4. The spectrally hard X-ray emission shows tentative evidence for orbital variability. Using more than 12 years of Fermi-LAT data, we refined the position of the {\gamma}-ray source, and the optical candidate still lies within the 68% positional error circle. In addition to 4FGL J1910.7-5320, we find a variable optical source with a periodic signal of 4.28-hr inside the 4FGL catalog 95% error region of another unidentified Fermi source, 4FGL J2029.5-4237. However, the {\gamma}-ray source does not have a significant X-ray counterpart in a 11.7 ks Chandra observation, with a 3-{\sigma} flux upper limit of 2.4*10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (0.3-7 keV). Moreover, the optical source is outside our updated Fermi-LAT 95% error circle. These observational facts all suggest that this new redback millisecond pulsar powers the {\gamma}-ray source 4FGL J1910.7-5320 while 4FGL J2029.5-4237 is unlikely the {\gamma}-ray counterpart to the 4.28-hr variable. |

|| Themiya Nanayakkara, et al. -- incl., <mark>Corentin Schreiber</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2022-12-23*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted*|
|**Abstract**| The confirmation of the presence of very massive quiescent galaxies at epochs only 1-2 Gyr after the Big Bang [1-8] has challenged models of cosmology and galaxy formation [9]. Producing sufficient numbers of these requires abundant numbers of the host dark matter halos to have been assembled and sufficient time for star formation to proceed extremely quickly and then cease just as rapidly. Ground-based spectroscopy has suggested ages of 200-300 Myr[3] at redshifts $3<z<4$. The true number and ages of these objects have however been highly uncertain as ground-based spectra has been limited to the brightest of them [e.g. 3, 5], at wavelengths ~2$\mu$m, which introduces a signficant potential bias towards younger objects [7]. The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) enables dramatically more sensitive and constraining spectroscopic observations due to the very low sky background, sharp image quality, and access to wavelengths beyond 2{\mu}m. Here we report JWST NIRSpec [10] (0.6-5.3$\mu$m) observations of five new quiescent galaxy candidates that were beyond the limit of previous ground-based spectroscopy. The high signal:noise spectra of galaxies with continuum significantly fainter than earlier confirmations show that they are also at redshifts 3<z<4, and that they have substantial stellar masses of ~0.5-1.2x1011 M$\odot$ comparable to massive galaxies in the nearby Universe. One of the galaxies has been quenched for >~ 1 billion years pointing to a presence of substantially older and fainter galaxies than those revealed so far by ground-based spectroscopy. This suggests that some of the massive galaxies have very early formation epochs (during the epoch of reionization, z >~ 6) pointing to a need for high conversion rates of baryons to stars in the first massive galaxy halos in the early Universe [11, 12]. |

|*Appeared on*| *2022-12-23*|
|*Comments*| *The catalog will be publicly made available when accepted, or before upon reasonable request*|
|**Abstract**| Context: In the latest Gaia data release (DR3), the GSP-Spec module has provided stellar parameters and chemical abundances measured from the RVS spectra alone. However, very metal-poor stars (VMP stars; $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]<-2$) suffer from parameter degeneracy due to a lack of information in their spectra, making it difficult to obtain reliable stellar parameters and metallicities for many of them. Aim: We aim to improve metallicity estimates for VMP stars analysed by the GSP-Spec module. Methods: We compute the Ca triplet equivalent widths from the published set of GSP-Spec stellar parameters. We then convert these obtained equivalent widths to metallicities adopting photometric temperatures and surface gravities that we derive based on Gaia and 2MASS catalogs. Results: Comparison to high-resolution studies shows that our approach drastically reduces the cases where the estimated metallicities are far off for VMP stars. Now only $23\%$ of VMP stars have a metallicity different by more than $0.5\,\mathrm{dex}$ from a high-resolution value, while this fraction is $76\%$ with the original metallicity estimates by the GSP-Spec module. We explore possible ways to remove stars with poor metallicity estimates while keeping as many stars with reliable metallicity as possible. Our improved metallicity estimates and new quality cut result in producing a catalog of bright ($G\lesssim 13$) metal-poor stars, containing 57 stars at $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]<-3$ and 2202 VMP stars. These numbers increase to 174 and 2794 if one allows a low level of metal-rich contaminants. Conclusion: The inclusion of photometric information greatly contributes to breaking parameter degeneracy, enabling precise metallicity estimates for VMP stars from Gaia RVS spectra. We produce a publicly-available catalog of bright metal-poor stars suitable for high-resolution follow-up. |

|*Appeared on*| *2022-12-23*|
|*Comments*| *19 pages, 5 figures*|
|**Abstract**| We present a model for the squeezed dark matter bispectrum, where the short modes are deep in the non-linear regime. We exploit the consistency relations for large-scale structures combined with a response function approach to write the squeezed bispectrum in terms of a few unknown functions of the short modes. We provide an ansatz for a fitting function for these response functions, checking that the resulting model is reliable when compared to the one-loop squeezed bispectrum. We then test the model against measured bispectra from numerical simulations for short modes ranging between $k \sim 0.1 \, h/$Mpc, and $k \sim 0.7 \, h/$Mpc at redshift $z=0$. To evaluate the goodness of the fit of our model we implement a non-Gaussian covariance and find agreement within $1$-$\sigma$ standard deviation of the simulated data. |

|**Abstract**| We report on improved sky localizations of thirteen repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) discovered by CHIME/FRB via the use of interferometric techniques on channelized voltages from the telescope. These so-called 'baseband localizations' improve the localization uncertainty area presented in past studies by more than three orders of magnitude. The improved localization regions are provided for the full sample of FRBs to enable follow-up studies. The localization uncertainties, together with limits on the source distances from their dispersion measures (DMs), allow us to identify likely host galaxies for two of the FRB sources. FRB 20180814A lives in a massive passive red spiral at z~0.068 with very little indication of star formation, while FRB 20190303A resides in a merging pair of spiral galaxies at z~0.064 undergoing significant star formation. These galaxies show very different characteristics, further confirming the presence of FRB progenitors in a variety of environments even among the repeating sub-class. |

|**Abstract**| Here we present PACMAN, an end-to-end pipeline developed to reduce and analyze HST/WFC3 data. The pipeline includes both spectral extraction and light curve fitting. The foundation of PACMAN has been already used in numerous publications (e.g., Kreidberg et al., 2014; Kreidberg et al., 2018) and these papers have already accumulated hundreds of citations. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has become the preeminent workhorse facility for the characterization of extrasolar planets. HST currently has two of the most powerful space-based tools for characterizing exoplanets over a broad spectral range: The Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) in the UV and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) in the Near Infrared. With the introduction of a spatial scan mode on WFC3 where the star moves perpendicular to the dispersion direction during an exposure, WFC3 observations have become very efficient due to the reduction of overhead time and the possibility of longer exposures without saturation. For exoplanet characterization, WFC3 is used for transit and secondary eclipse spectroscopy, and phase curve observations. The instrument has two different grisms: G102 with a spectral range from 800 nm to up to 1150 nm and G141 encompassing 1075 nm to about 1700 nm. The spectral range of WFC3/G141 is primarily sensitive to molecular absorption from water at approximately 1.4 microns. This led to the successful detection of water in the atmosphere of over a dozen of exoplanets. The bluer part of WFC3, the G102 grism, is also sensitive to water and most notably led to the first detection of a helium exosphere. |

|**Abstract**| Just like light, gravitational waves (GWs) are deflected and magnified by gravitational fields as they propagate through the Universe. However, their low frequency, phase coherence and feeble coupling to matter allow for distinct lensing phenomena, such as diffraction and central images, that are challenging to observe through electromagnetic sources. Here we explore how these phenomena can be used to probe features of gravitational lenses. We focus on two variants of the singular isothermal sphere, with 1) a variable slope of the matter density and 2) a central core. We describe the imprints of these features in the wave- and geometric-optics regimes, including the prospect of detecting central images. We forecast the capacity of LISA and advanced LIGO to study strongly lensed signals and measure the projected lens mass, impact parameter and slope or core size. A broad range of lens masses allows all parameters to be measured with precision up to $\sim 1/{\rm SNR}$, despite large degeneracies. Thanks to wave-optics corrections, all parameters can be measured, even when no central image forms. Although GWs are sensitive to projected quantities, we compute the probability distribution of lens redshift, virial mass and projection scale given a cosmology. As an application, we consider the prospect of constraining self-interacting and ultra-light dark matter, showing the regions of parameter space accessible to strongly-lensed GWs. The distinct GW signatures will enable novel probes of fundamental physics and astrophysics, including the properties of dark matter and the central regions of galactic halos. |
