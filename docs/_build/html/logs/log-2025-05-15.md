|**Abstract**|            The Lyman-$\alpha$ forest opacity fluctuations observed from high redshift quasar spectra have been proven to be extremely successful in order to probe the late phase of the reionization epoch. For ideal modeling of these opacity fluctuations, one of the main challenges is to satisfy the extremely high dynamic range requirements of the simulation box, resolving the Lyman alpha forest while probing the large cosmological scales. In this study, we adopt an efficient approach to model Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity fluctuations in coarse simulation volume, utilizing the semi-numerical reionization model SCRIPT (including inhomogeneous recombination and radiative feedback) integrated with a realistic photoionization background fluctuation generating model. Our model crucially incorporates ionization and temperature fluctuations, which are consistent with the reionization model. After calibrating our method with respect to high-resolution full hydrodynamic simulation, Nyx, we compare the models with available observational data at the redshift range, $z=5.0-6.1$. With a fiducial reionization model (reionization end at $z=5.8$), we demonstrate that the observed scatter in the effective optical depth can be matched reasonably well by tuning the free parameters of our model i.e. the effective ionizing photon mean free path and mean photoionization rate. We further pursue an MCMC-based parameter space exploration utilizing the available data to put constraints on the above free parameters. Our estimation prefers a slightly higher photoionization rate and slightly lower mean free path than the previous studies which is also a consequence of temperature fluctuations. This study holds significant promise for efficiently extracting important physical information about the Epoch of Reionization, utilizing the wealth of available and upcoming observational data.         |

|**Abstract**|            Tianyu telescope, an one-meter robotic optical survey instrument to be constructed in Lenghu, Qinghai, China, is designed for detecting transiting exoplanets, variable stars and transients. It requires a highly automated, optimally distributed, easily extendable, and highly flexible software to enable the data processing for the raw data at rates exceeding 500MB/s. In this work, we introduce the architecture of the Tianyu pipeline and use relative photometry as a case to demonstrate its high scalability and efficiency. This pipeline is tested on the data collected from Muguang observatory and Xinglong observatory. The pipeline demonstrates high scalability, with most processing stages increasing in throughput as the number of consumers grows. Compared to a single consumer, the median throughput of image calibration, alignment, and flux extraction increases by 41%, 257%, and 107% respectively when using 5 consumers, while image stacking exhibits limited scalability due to I/O constraints. In our tests, the pipeline was able to detect two transiting sources. Besides, the pipeline captures variability in the light curves of nine known and two previously unknown variable sources in the testing data. Meanwhile, the differential photometric precision of the light curves is near the theoretical limitation. These results indicate that this pipeline is suitable for detecting transiting exoplanets and variable stars. This work builds the fundation for further development of Tianyu software.

|**Abstract**|            Magnetic massive stars are stars of spectral types O, B and A that harbour $\sim$ kG strength (mostly dipolar) surface magnetic fields. Their non-thermal radio emission has been demonstrated to be an important magnetospheric probe, provided the emission is fully characterised. A necessary step for that is to build a statistically significant sample of radio-bright magnetic massive stars. In this paper, we present the `VAST project to study Magnetic Massive Stars' or VAST-MeMeS that aims to achieve that by taking advantage of survey data acquired with the Australian SKA Pathfinder telescope. VAST-MeMeS is defined under the `VAriable and Slow Transient' (VAST) survey, although it also uses data from other ASKAP surveys. We found radio detections from 48 magnetic massive stars, out of which, 14 do not have any prior radio detections. We also identified 9 `Main-sequence Radio Pulse Emitter' candidates based on variability and circular polarisation of flux densities. The expanded sample suggests a lower efficiency in the radio production than that reported in earlier work. In addition to significantly expanding the sample of radio-bright magnetic massive stars, the addition of flux density measurements at $\lesssim 1$ GHz revealed that the spectra of incoherent radio emission can extend to much lower frequencies than that assumed in the past. In the future, radio observations spanning wide frequency and rotational phase ranges should be conducted so as to reduce the uncertainties in the incoherent radio luminosities. The results from these campaigns, supplemented with precise estimations of stellar parameters, will allow us to fully understand particle acceleration and non-thermal radio production in large-scale stellar magnetospheres.         |
