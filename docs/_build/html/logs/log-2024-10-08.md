|**Abstract**|            ASPIRE (A SPectroscopic survey of bIased halos in the Reionization Era) is a quasar legacy survey primarily using JWST to target a sample of 25 $z>6$ quasars with NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and imaging. The first study in this series found evidence of a strong overdensity of galaxies around J0305-3150, a luminous quasar at $z=6.61$, within a single NIRCam pointing obtained in JWST Cycle 1. Here, we present the first results of a JWST Cycle 2 mosaic that covers 35 arcmin$^2$ with NIRCam imaging/WFSS of the same field to investigate the spatial extent of the putative protocluster. The F356W grism data targets [OIII]+H$\beta$ at $5.3<z<7$ and reveals a population of 124 line emitters down to a flux limit of 1.2$\times$10$^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. Fifty-three of these galaxies lie at $6.5<z<6.8$ spanning 10 cMpc on the sky, corresponding to an overdensity within a 2500 cMpc$^3$ volume of 12.5 $\pm$ 2.6, anchored by the quasar. Comparing to the [OIII] luminosity function from the Emission line galaxies and Intergalactic Gas in the Epoch of Reionization (EIGER) project, we find a dearth of faint [OIII] emitters at log(L/erg s$^{-1}$) $<$ 42.3, which we suggest is consistent with either bursty star formation causing galaxies to scatter around the grism detection limit or modest suppression from quasar feedback. While we find a strong filamentary overdensity of [OIII] emitters consistent with a protocluster, we suggest that we could be insensitive to a population of older, more massive Lyman-break galaxies with weak nebular emission on scales $>10$ cMpc.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present paper II comprising a 35 arcmin$^2$ JWST/NIRCam imaging and wide-field slitless spectroscopy mosaic centered on J0305$-$3150, a luminous quasar at $z=6.61$. The F356W grism data reveals 124 [OIII]+H$\beta$ emitters at $5.3<z<7$, 53 of which constitute a protocluster spanning (10 cMpc)$^2$ across $6.5<z<6.8$. We find no evidence of any broad-line AGN in individual galaxies or stacking, reporting a median H$\beta$ FWHM of 585 $\pm$ 152 km s$^{-1}$; however, the mass-excitation diagram and ``little red dot" color and compactness criteria suggest that there are a few AGN candidates on the outskirts of the protocluster. We fit the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the [OIII] emitters with Prospector and Bagpipes, and find that none of the SED-derived properties (stellar mass, age, or star formation rate) correlates with proximity to the quasar. While there is no correlation between galaxy age and local galaxy density, we find modest correlations between local galaxy density with increasing stellar mass, decreasing 10-to-100 Myr star formation rate ratios and decreasing nebular line equivalent widths. We further find that the protocluster galaxies are consistent with being more massive, older, and hosting higher star formation rates than the field sample at the 3$\sigma$ level, distributed in a filamentary structure which supports inside-out formation of the protocluster. There is modest evidence that galaxy evolution proceeds differently as a function of the density of local environment within protoclusters during the epoch of reionization, and the central quasar has little effect on the galaxy properties of the surrounding structure.         |

|**Abstract**|            The number of observed giant radio sources (GRSs) has increased significantly in recent years, yet their formation mechanisms remain elusive. The discovery of giant radio galaxies within galaxy clusters has further intensified the ongoing this http URL utilize magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the formation of GRSs in cluster this http URL avoid confounding the effects of power and total energy injection, we hold the energy of jet outbursts fixed and study the effect of power by varying the active duration of the jets. Furthermore, we examine the roles of magnetic, thermal, and kinetic energy components by adjusting their fractions in the jets. Additionally, we calculate radio emission for comparison with observations in the radio power-linear size diagram (P-D diagram). We find the 'lower power-larger bubble' effect: lower-power jets tend to produce larger radio sources with fixed total jet energy. Regarding different energy components, jets dominated by toroidal magnetic field energy generate larger radio sources than kinetic and thermal energy-dominated jets. Conversely, strong poloidal magnetic fields hinder radio lobe growth. When injecting $2.06 \times 10^{59}$ erg into a $10^{14}$ solar mass halo, only jets with powers of approximately $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$ Eddington luminosity efficiently traverse the observational region in the P-D diagram. Our findings suggest that energetic, long-lasting (low-power), continuous jets endowed with significant toroidal magnetic fields facilitate the formation of GRSs in cluster environments. However, although the jets with significantly lower power can generate substantially larger radio sources, their faintness may render them unobservable.         |

|| <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-10-08*|
|*Comments*| *Chapter accepted for Encyclopedia of Atmospheric Sciences, Third Edition. 35 pages, 8 figures, and 2 tables*|
|**Abstract**|            The atmospheres within our Solar System can be categorized into four distinct climate regimes: "terrestrial", "Jovian", "condensable", and "exosphere". Beyond the three terrestrial planets (excluding Mercury) and the four giant planets, collisional atmospheres are also found on smaller celestial bodies such as Jupiter's moon Io, Saturn's moon Titan, Neptune's moon Triton, and Pluto. This article reviews the key characteristics of these atmospheres and the underlying physical and chemical processes that govern them. I focus on their thermal structures, chemical constituents, wind patterns, and the origins and losses of the atmospheres, and highlight the critical roles of surface ices and liquids, atmospheric hazes, and the space environments of their host planets in shaping these atmospheres. I dedicated this article to Prof. Zuo Xiao (1936-2024) at Peking University.         |
