|**Abstract**|            The Galactic Be star binary MWC 656 was long considered the only known Be star + black hole (BH) system, making it a critical benchmark for models of massive binary evolution and for the expected X-ray emission of Be+BH binaries. However, recent dynamical measurements cast doubt on the presence of a BH companion. We present new multi-epoch ultraviolet spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), combined with high-resolution optical spectra, to reassess the nature of the companion. The far-ultraviolet spectra reveal high-ionisation features, including prominent N V and He II lines, which are absent in the spectra of normal Be stars and are indicative of a hot, luminous companion. Spectral modelling shows that these features cannot originate from the Be star or from an accretion disc around a compact object. Instead, we find that the data are best explained by a hot ($T_\mathrm{eff} \approx 85$ kK), compact, hydrogen-deficient star with strong wind signatures, consistent with an intermediate-mass stripped star. Our revised orbital solution and composite spectroscopic modelling yield a companion mass of $M_2 = 1.54^{+0.57}_{-0.46}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, definitively ruling out a BH and disfavouring a white dwarf. MWC 656 thus joins the growing class of Be + stripped star binaries. The system's unusual properties - including a high companion temperature and wind strength - extend the known parameter space of such binaries. The continued absence of confirmed OBe+BH binaries in the Galaxy highlights a growing tension with population synthesis models.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the first high-resolution ($\sim$ 0.14") Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 dust continuum and CO molecular line emission observations of the quadruple system HD 34700. In particular, HD 34700AaAb is a spectroscopic binary ($M_{\rm{bin}}=4\,M_\odot$) surrounded by two low-mass companions at large separations. Its circumbinary disk is highly substructured, featuring numerous spiral arms and a large cavity observed in infrared (IR) scattered light. We analyzed the CO line channel and intensity moment maps. By fitting a Keplerian model to the line channel emission, we identified the residual motions and conducted a line spectra analysis. We resolved an asymmetric continuum crescent on top of a dust ring at 0.39" (138 au), colocated with the IR ring. The CO molecule line emissions trace a smaller cavity in gas, whose edge aligns with the inner rim of the ring detected in H$\alpha$ emission at 0.20" (65 au). The $^{12}$CO line emission and kinematics trace highly non-Keplerian motions ($\sim0.1\Delta\upsilon_{\rm kep}$), and these CO spiral features align well with the spiral structures in scattered light. The $^{12}$CO line spectra analysis reveals a streamer above the southeastern disk plane, likely falling onto the disk. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O kinematics largely follow the disk's underlying Keplerian rotation, while $^{13}$CO exhibits tentative signs of anticyclonic vortex flows at the continuum crescent location. Our multimolecular line study suggests that the circumbinary disk of HD 34700A is highly perturbed in its upper layers, possibly warped and influenced by infalling material. While late-stage infall may account for the IR spirals and the formation of the vortex through Rossby wave instability, an embedded massive companion within the cavity may also contribute to these features.         |

|**Abstract**|            The A1V star $\gamma$ Oph, at a distance of 29.7 pc, is known from Spitzer imaging to host a debris disk with a large radial extent and from its spectral energy distribution to host inner warm dust. We imaged $\gamma$ Oph with JWST/MIRI at 15 and 25.5 microns, which reveal smooth and radially broad emission that extends to a radius of at least 250 au at 25.5 microns. In contrast to JWST findings of an inner small-grain component with distinct ringed substructures in Fomalhaut and Vega, the mid-infrared radial profile combined with prior ALMA imaging suggests a radially broad steady-state collisional cascade with the same grain size distribution throughout the disk. This further suggests that the system is populated by a radially broad planetesimal belt from tens of au or less to well over 200 au, rather than a narrow planetesimal belt from which the observed dust is displaced to appear broad. The disk is also found to be asymmetric, which could be modelled by a stellocentric offset corresponding to a small eccentricity of $\sim$0.02. Such a disk eccentricity could be induced by a mildly eccentric $<$$10\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$ giant planet outside 10 au, or a more eccentric companion up to stellar mass at a few au, without producing a resolvable radial gap in the disk.         |

|**Abstract**|            Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical particles and compelling candidates for cold dark matter. Their existence could be probed through their conversions into photons in the presence of magnetic fields. In this work, we explore the effect of these photon-ALP conversions by searching for an attenuation in the observed gamma ray spectra of galactic sources that emit at energies of hundreds of TeV. We analyze data from the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory for the source 3HWC J1908+063. No evidence of photon-ALP conversions was found, and we set constraints on the ALP parameter space. Specifically, we derive exclusion limits for ALPs with masses in the range $10^{-8}~\mathrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 10^{-6}~\mathrm{eV}$ and photon-ALP couplings in the range $10^{-12}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1} \leq g_{a\gamma} \leq 10^{-10}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$, based on HAWC observations.         |

|| <mark>J. Li</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            In this paper, we present the most comprehensive study to date on Neptune's mean-motion resonances (MMRs) in the distant Kuiper belt from 50 to 100 AU. Over 200 resonant Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) have been identified in this region, spanning resonances from the 2nd-order 1:3 MMR to the 22nd-order 7:29 MMR, with inclinations $i<40^\circ$. Building on these diverse distributions, we first analyse the dynamical features of numerous $m$:$n$ MMRs, providing an informative database that includes the possible eccentricity ($e$) range, resonance widths, resonance centres, and permissible $(e,i)$ distributions. We then conduct numerical simulations to explore the long-term stability of these MMRs. Our results show that: (1) resonators can occupy all 1:$n$ to 7:$n$ MMRs, with nearly any $n$ corresponding to the 50-100 AU region, including the farthest-out MMRs of 5:29 (24th-order), 6:35 (29th-order), and 7:40 (33rd-order). This suggests that KBOs could potentially exist in even higher-order MMRs than those currently observed. (2) For each set of $m$:$n$ resonances with the same $m$, resonators consistently exhibit inclinations up to $40^\circ$, while eccentricities remain strictly restricted below 0.7. (3) For the 1:3 and 1:4 MMRs, the leading population is less stable than the trailing population. Most interestingly, we discover a novel phenomenon of number reversal, where the higher-order, weaker 3:8 MMR (at semimajor axis $a\approx57.9$ AU) hosts more resonators, rather than fewer as expected, compared to the lower-order, stronger 3:7 MMR (at $a\approx53.0$ AU). Future observations, whether confirming or challenging this phenomenon, will offer valuable insight into the eccentricity and inclination distributions of primordial KBOs.         |
