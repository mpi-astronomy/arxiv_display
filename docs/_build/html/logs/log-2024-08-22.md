|**Abstract**|            Aminoacetonitrile (AAN), also known as glycinenitrile, has been suggested as a possible precursor of glycine and adenine in the interstellar medium. Here we present the chemical modeling of AAN and its isomers in hot cores using the three-phase chemical model NAUTILUS with the addition of over 300 chemical reactions of the three AAN isomers and related species. Our models predicted a peak gas phase abundance of AAN reaching the order of 10-8, which is consistent with observation towards Sgr B2(N). Regarding the reaction pathways of AAN and its isomers, we found that AAN is primarily formed via free radical reactions on grain surfaces during the early evolutionary stages. Subsequently, it is thermally desorbed into the gas phase as the temperature rises and is then destroyed by positive ions and radicals in gas phase. The isomers of AAN are formed through the hydrogenation reaction of CH3NCN on the grain surface and via electron recombination reactions of ion C2H5N2+ in gas phase. We speculate that there is a possibility for NCCN and AAN to react with each other, eventually leading to the formation of adenine in hot cores. However, further investigation is required to understand the efficiency of grain surfaces in adenine formation, through theoretical calculations or laboratory experiments in future research.         |

|**Abstract**|            JWST provides new opportunities to cross-check the HST Cepheid/SNeIa distance ladder, which yields the most precise local measure of H0. We analyze early JWST subsamples (~1/4 of the HST sample) from the SH0ES and CCHP groups, calibrated by a single anchor (N4258). We find HST Cepheid distances agree well (~1 sigma) with all 8 combinations of methods, samples, and telescopes: JWST Cepheids, TRGB, and JAGB by either group, plus HST TRGB and Miras. The comparisons explicitly include the measurement uncertainty of each method in N4258, an oft-neglected but dominant term. Mean differences are ~0.03 mag, far smaller than the 0.18 mag "Hubble tension." Combining all measures produces the strongest constraint yet on the linearity of HST Cepheid distances, 0.994+-0.010, ruling out distance-dependent bias or offset as the source of the tension at ~7 sigma. Yet, measurements of H0 from current JWST subsamples produce large sampling differences whose size and direction we can directly estimate from the full HST set. We show that Delta(H0)~2.5 km/s/Mpc between the CCHP JWST program and the full HST sample is entirely consistent with differences in sample selection. Combining all JWST samples produces a new, distance-limited set of 16 SNeIa at D<25 Mpc and more closely resembles the full sample thanks to "reversion to the mean" of larger samples. Using JWST Cepheids, JAGB, and TRGB, we find 73.4+-2.1, 72.2+-2.2, and 72.1+-2.2 km/s/Mpc, respectively. Explicitly accounting for SNe in common, the combined-sample three-method result from JWST is H0=72.6+-2.0, similar to H0=72.8 expected from HST Cepheids in the same galaxies. The small JWST sample trivially lowers the Hubble tension significance due to small-sample statistics and is not yet competitive with the HST set (42 SNeIa and 4 anchors), which yields 73.2+-0.9. Still, the joint JWST sample provides important crosschecks which the HST data passes.         |
