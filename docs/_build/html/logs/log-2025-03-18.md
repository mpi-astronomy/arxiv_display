|**Abstract**|            The Galactic Centre region contains a dense accumulation of stars, which can be separated into two components: A flattened and dense nuclear star cluster (NSC), and a surrounding, more extended and more flattened, nuclear stellar disc (NSD). Previous studies have collected a few thousand spectra of the inner NSC, and also the outer NSD, and measured line-of-sight velocities and metallicities. Until now, such measurements exist only for a few 100 stars in the region where the stellar surface density transitions from being dominated by the NSC into being dominated by the NSD. We want to study the stellar population from the centre of the NSC out to well beyond its effective radius, where the NSD dominates. We investigate whether and how the mean properties and kinematics of the stars change systematically. We conducted spectroscopic observations with Flamingos-2 in the K-band via a continuous slit-scan. The data extend from the central NSC into the inner NSD, out to 32 pc from Sgr A* along Galactic longitude l. Based on their CO equivalent width, we classify the stars as hot or cool stars. The former are massive, young stars, while almost all of the latter are older than one to a few Gyr. We measure the overall metallicity [M/H] and line-of-sight velocity for >2,500 cool stars, and present the first continuous spatial maps and profiles of the mean value of various stellar and kinematic parameters. We identify hot, young stars across the field of view. Some stars appear to be isolated, while others accumulate near the Quintuplet cluster or the central parsec cluster. The position-velocity curve of the cool stars shows no dependence on [M/H], but it depends on the colour of the stars. The colour may be a tracer of the line-of-sight distance and thus distinguish stars located in the NSC from those in the NSD. [abridged]         |

|**Abstract**|            The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will enable a transformative leap in the direct imaging and characterization of Earth-like exoplanets. For this, NASA is focusing on early investment in technology development prior to mission definition and actively seeking international partnerships earlier than for previous missions. The "R&D for Space-Based HCI in Europe" workshop, held in March 2024 at Paris Observatory, convened leading experts in high-contrast imaging (HCI) to discuss European expertise and explore potential strategies for European contributions to HWO. This paper synthesizes the discussions and outcomes of the workshop, highlighting Europe's critical contributions to past and current HCI efforts, the synergies between ground- and space-based technologies, and the importance of laboratory testbeds and collaborative funding mechanisms. Key conclusions include the need for Europe to invest in technology development for areas such as deformable mirrors and advanced detectors, and establish or enhance laboratory facilities for system-level testing. Putting emphasis on the urgency of aligning with the timeline of the HWO, the participants called on an open affirmation by the European Space Agency (ESA) that a European contribution to HWO is clearly anticipated, to signal national agencies and unlock funding opportunities at the national level. Based on the expertise demonstrated through R&D, Europe is poised to play a pivotal role in advancing global HCI capabilities, contributing to the characterization of temperate exoplanets and fostering innovation across domains.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2025-03-18*|

|**Abstract**|            We report the discovery of two new magnetic cataclysmic variables with brown dwarf companions and long orbital periods ($P_{\rm orb}=95\pm1$ and $104\pm2$ min). This discovery increases the sample of candidate magnetic period bouncers with confirmed sub-stellar donors from four to six. We also find their X-ray luminosity from archival XMM-Newton observations to be in the range $L_{\rm X}\approx10^{28}$$-$$10^{29} \mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ in the 0.25$-$10 keV band. This low luminosity is comparable with the other candidates, and at least an order of magnitude lower than the X-ray luminosities typically measured in cataclysmic variables. The X-ray fluxes imply mass transfer rates that are much lower than predicted by evolutionary models, even if some of the discrepancy is due to the accretion energy being emitted in other bands, such as via cyclotron emission at infrared wavelengths. Although it is possible that some or all of these systems formed directly as binaries containing a brown dwarf, it is likely that the donor used to be a low-mass star and that the systems followed the evolutionary track for cataclysmic variables, evolving past the period bounce. The donor in long period systems is expected to be a low-mass, cold brown dwarf. This hypothesis is supported by near-infrared photometric observations that constrain the donors in the two systems to be brown dwarfs cooler than $\approx$1100 K (spectral types T5 or later), most likely losing mass via Roche Lobe overflow or winds. The serendipitous discovery of two magnetic period bouncers in the small footprint of the XMM-Newton source catalog implies a large space density of these type of systems, possibly compatible with the prediction of 40$-$70 per cent of magnetic cataclysmic variables to be period bouncers.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present and analyse the results of the Science data challenge 3a (SDC3a, this https URL), an EoR foreground-removal community-wide exercise organised by the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO). The challenge ran for 8 months, from March to October 2023. Participants were provided with realistic simulations of SKA-Low data between 106 MHz and 196 MHz, including foreground contamination from extragalactic as well as Galactic emission, instrumental and systematic effects. They were asked to deliver cylindrical power spectra of the EoR signal, cleaned from all corruptions, and the corresponding confidence levels. Here we describe the approaches taken by the 17 teams that completed the challenge, and we assess their performance using different metrics. The challenge results provide a positive outlook on the capabilities of current foreground-mitigation approaches to recover the faint EoR signal from SKA-Low observations. The median error committed in the EoR power spectrum recovery is below the true signal for seven teams, although in some cases there are some significant outliers. The smallest residual overall is $4.2_{-4.2}^{+20} \times 10^{-4}\,\rm{K}^2h^{-3}$cMpc$^{3}$ across all considered scales and frequencies. The estimation of confidence levels provided by the teams is overall less accurate, with the true error being typically under-estimated, sometimes very significantly. The most accurate error bars account for $60 \pm 20$\% of the true errors committed. The challenge results provide a means for all teams to understand and improve their performance. This challenge indicates that the comparison between independent pipelines could be a powerful tool to assess residual biases and improve error estimation.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2025-03-18*|
|*Comments*| *14 pages, 10 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            We study the cosmological information contained in the cosmic web, categorized as four structure types: nodes, filaments, walls, and voids, using the Quijote simulations and a modified  nexus+ algorithm. We show that splitting the density field by the four structure types and combining the power spectrum in each provides much tighter constraints on cosmological parameters than using the power spectrum without splitting. We show the rich information contained in the cosmic web structures -- related to the Hessian of the density field -- for measuring all of the cosmological parameters, and in particular for constraining neutrino mass. We study the constraints as a function of Fourier scale, configuration space smoothing scale, and the underlying field. For the matter field with $k_{\rm max}=0.5\,h/{\rm Mpc}$, we find a factor of $\times20$ tighter constraints on neutrino mass when using smoothing scales larger than 12.5~Mpc/$h$, and $\times80$ tighter when using smoothing scales down to 1.95~Mpc/$h$. However, for the CDM+Baryon field we observe a more modest $\times1.7$ or $\times3.6$ improvement, for large and small smoothing scales respectively. We release our new python package for identifying cosmic structures pycosmmommf at this https URL to enable future studies of the cosmological information of the cosmic web.         |

|**Abstract**|            Compact objects undergoing mass transfer exhibit significant (and double-peaked) $H_{\alpha}$ emission lines. Recently, new methods have been developed to identify black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) and calculate their systematic parameters using $H_{\alpha}$ line parameters, such as the full-width at half maximum (FWHM), equivalent width (EW), and separation of double peaks. In addition, the FWHM-EW plane from spectroscopy and the $H_{\alpha}$ color-color diagram from photometry can be used for rapid stellar classification. We measure the $H_{\alpha}$ and $H_{\beta}$ profiles (e.g., FWHM and EW) using the LAMOST DR9 low- and medium-resolution spectra, and calculate the systematic parameters (e.g., velocity semi-amplitude of the donor star, mass ratio, inclination angle, and mass of the accretor). A new correlation between FWHM and $K_{\rm 2}$, $K_{\rm 2} = 0.205(18)\ \rm{FWHM}$, is obtained for cataclysmic variables (CVs) in our sample. Both the FWHM-EW plane and the $H_{\alpha}$ color-color diagram can distinguish CVs with FWHM $\gtrsim$ 1000 km/s from Be stars and young stellar objects (YSOs) to some extent. To improve classification accuracy and enhance the selection of compact objects, we propose a new set of idealized filters with effective widths of 30 Å, 130 Å, and 400 Å\ for the narrow $H_{\alpha}$ filter, broad $H_{\alpha}$ filter, and $r$-band filter, respectively.         |

|| K. Xiao, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-03-18*|
|*Comments*| *8 pages, 6 figures, ApJL accepted, see main results in Figures 4*|
|**Abstract**|            We present a pioneering achievement in the high-precision photometric calibration of CMOS-based photometry, by application of the Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra-based synthetic photometry (XPSP) method to the mini-SiTian array (MST) photometry. Through 79 repeated observations of the $\texttt{f02}$ field on the night, we find good internal consistency in the calibrated MST $G_{\rm MST}$-band magnitudes for relatively bright stars, with a precision of about 4\,mmag for $G_{\rm MST}\sim 13$. Results from more than 30 different nights (over 3100 observations) further confirm this internal consistency, indicating that the 4\,mmag precision is stable and achievable over timescales of months. An independent external validation using spectroscopic data from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) DR10 and high-precision photometric data using CCDs from Gaia DR3 reveals a zero-point consistency better than 1\,mmag. Our results clearly demonstrate that CMOS photometry is on par with CCD photometry for high-precision results, highlighting the significant capabilities of CMOS cameras in astronomical observations, especially for large-scale telescope survey arrays.         |

|| Y. Deng, et al. -- incl., <mark>S. Jiao</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-03-18*|

|**Abstract**|            We present a study of giant molecular cloud (GMC) properties in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) using CO(3-2) data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) in selected regions across the disc and in the nuclear ring, and comparing them with CO(1-0) observations from the IRAM 30m telescope in the same regions. We find that GMCs in the centre of M31 generally exhibit larger velocity dispersions ($\sigma$) and sizes ($R$) compared to those in the disc, while their average surface density ($\Sigma$) and turbulent pressure ($P_{\rm turb}$) are lower. This low turbulent pressure in the central region is primarily due to the low density of molecular gas. The estimated GMC properties depend on the choice of CO transitions. Compared to CO(1-0), CO(3-2) exhibits smaller velocity dispersion and equivalent radius but higher surface density. These differences highlight the distinct physical conditions probed by different molecular gas tracers. We estimate the virial parameter $\alpha_{\rm vir}\propto \sigma^2 R/\Sigma$ and find that most molecular clouds exhibit high values ($\alpha_{\rm vir} \sim 4-6$) for both CO transitions, indicating that they are unbound. Furthermore, clouds in the nuclear ring display even larger $\alpha_{\rm vir}$ values of $\lesssim 100$, suggesting that they may be highly dynamic, short-lived structures, although they could potentially achieve equilibrium under the external pressure exerted by the surrounding interstellar medium.         |
