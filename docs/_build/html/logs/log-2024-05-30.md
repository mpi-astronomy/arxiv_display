|**Abstract**|            Solar magnetic fields are closely related to various physical phenomena on the sun, which can be extrapolated with different models from photospheric magnetograms. However, the Open Flux Problem (OFP), the underestimation of the magnetic field derived from the extrapolated model, is still unsolved. To minimize the impact of the OFP, we propose three evaluation parameters to quantitatively evaluate magnetic field models and determine the optimal free parameters in the models by constraining the coronal magnetic fields (CMFs) and the interplanetary magnetic fields (IMFs) with real observations. Although the OFP still exists, we find that magnetic field lines traced from the coronal models effectively capture the intricate topological configurations observed in the corona, including streamers and plumes. The OFP is lessened by using the HMI synoptic map instead of the GONG daily synoptic maps, and the PFSS+PFCS model instead of the CSSS model. For Carrington Rotation (CR) 2231 at the solar minimum, we suggest that the optimal parameters for the PFSS+PFCS model are $R_{\mathrm{ss}} = 2.2-2.5\ R_{\mathrm{sun}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{scs}} = 10.5-14.0\ R_{\mathrm{sun}}$, as well as for the CSSS model are $R_{\mathrm{cs}} = 2.0 - 2.4\ R_{\mathrm{sun}}$, $R_{\mathrm{ss}} = 11.0 - 14.7\ R_{\mathrm{sun}}$ and $a = 1.0\ R_{\mathrm{sun}}$. Despite the IMFs at 1 AU being consistent with the measurements by artificially increasing the polar magnetic fields, the IMFs near the sun are still underestimated. The OFP might be advanced by improving the accuracy of both the weak magnetic fields and polar magnetic fields, especially considering magnetic activities arising from interplanetary physical processes.         |

|**Abstract**|            The assembly and co-evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and their host galaxy stellar population is a key open questions in galaxy evolution. Stellar mass ($M_\star$) and star formation rate (SFR), are inferred by modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED). For galaxies triggering SMBH activity, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) contaminates the light at all wavelengths, hampering the inference of galaxy parameters. Incomplete AGN templates can lead to systematic overestimates of the stellar mass, biasing our understanding of AGN-galaxy co-evolution. This challenge has gained further impetus with the advent of sensitive wide-area surveys with millions of luminous AGN, including by eROSITA, Euclid and LSST. We aim to estimate the accuracy and bias of AGN host galaxy parameters and improve upon existing techniques. This work makes two contributions: 1) a new SED fitting code, GRAHSP, with a flexible, empirically motivated AGN model including a power law continuum emission lines, a FeII forest and a flexible infrared torus. We verify that our model reproduces published X-ray to infrared SEDs of AGN to better than 20\% accuracy. A fully Bayesian fit with nested sampling includes uncertainties in the model and the data, making the inference highly robust. 2) we created a benchmark photometric dataset where pure quasars are merged with non-AGN pure galaxies into a hybrid (Chimera) object but with known galaxy and AGN properties. Comparing the true and retrieved $M_\star$, SFR and AGN luminosities shows that previous codes systematically over-estimate $M_\star$ and SFR by 0.5 dex with a wide scatter of 0.7 dex, at AGN luminosities above 10^44 erg/s. In contrast, GRAHSP shows no bias on $M_\star$ and SFR. GRAHSP also estimates more realistic uncertainties. GRAHSP enables characterization of the environmental conditions conducive to black hole growth. (abridged)         |
