|**Abstract**| The use of Gaussian processes (GPs) is a common approach to account for correlated noise in exoplanet time-series, particularly for transmission and emission spectroscopy. This analysis has typically been performed for each wavelength channel separately, with the retrieved uncertainties in the transmission spectrum assumed to be independent. However, the presence of noise correlated in wavelength could cause these uncertainties to be correlated, which could significantly affect the results of atmospheric retrievals. We present a method which uses a GP to model noise correlated in both wavelength and time simultaneously for the full spectroscopic data set while avoiding the use of a 'common-mode' correction. To make this analysis computationally tractable, we introduce a fast and flexible GP method which can analyse 2D data sets when the input points lie on a (potentially non-uniform) 2D grid - in our case a time by wavelength grid - and the kernel function has a Kronecker product structure. This simultaneously fits all light curves and enables the retrieval of the covariance matrix of the transmission spectrum. By testing on synthetic data sets, we demonstrate that our new approach can reliably recover atmospheric features contaminated by noise correlated in time and wavelength. In contrast, fitting each spectroscopic light curve separately performed poorly when wavelength-correlated noise was present. It frequently underestimated the uncertainty of the scattering slope and overestimated the uncertainty in the strength of sharp absorption peaks in transmission spectra. Two archival VLT/FORS2 transit observations of WASP-31b were re-analysed, with our method strongly constraining the presence of wavelength-correlated noise in both data sets and recovering significantly different constraints on atmospheric features such as the scattering slope and strength of sodium and potassium features. |

|**Abstract**| The Chasing All Transients Constellation Hunters (CATCH) space mission is an intelligent constellation consisting of 126 micro-satellites in three types (A, B, and C), designed for X-ray observation with the objective of studying the dynamic universe. Currently, we are actively developing the first Pathfinder (CATCH-1) for the CATCH mission, specifically for type-A satellites. CATCH-1 is equipped with Micro Pore Optics (MPO) and a 4-pixel Silicon Drift Detector (SDD) array. To assess its scientific performance, including the effective area of the optical system, on-orbit background, and telescope sensitivity, we employ the Monte Carlo software Geant4 for simulation in this study. The MPO optics exhibit an effective area of $41$ cm$^2$ at the focal spot for 1 keV X-rays, while the entire telescope system achieves an effective area of $29$ cm$^2$ at 1 keV when taking into account the SDD detector's detection efficiency. The primary contribution to the background is found to be from the Cosmic X-ray Background. Assuming a 625 km orbit with an inclination of $29^\circ$, the total background for CATCH-1 is estimated to be $8.13\times10^{-2}$ counts s$^{-1}$ in the energy range of 0.5--4 keV. Based on the background within the central detector and assuming a Crab-like source spectrum, the estimated ideal sensitivity could achieve $1.9\times10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ for an exposure of 10$^4$ s in the energy band of 0.5--4 keV. Furthermore, after simulating the background caused by low-energy charged particles near the geomagnetic equator, we have determined that there is no need to install a magnetic deflector. |
