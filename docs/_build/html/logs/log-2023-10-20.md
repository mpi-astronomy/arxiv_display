|**Abstract**| We summarize the properties and initial data release of the JADES Origins Field (JOF), which will soon be the deepest imaging field yet observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This field falls within the GOODS-S region about 8' south-west of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), where it was formed initially in Cycle 1 as a parallel field of HUDF spectroscopic observations within the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). This imaging will be greatly extended in Cycle 2 program 3215, which will observe the JOF for 5 days in six medium-band filters, seeking robust candidates for z>15 galaxies. This program will also include ultra-deep parallel NIRSpec spectroscopy (up to 104 hours on-source, summing over the dispersion modes) on the HUDF. Cycle 3 observations from program 4540 will add 20 hours of NIRCam slitless spectroscopy to the JOF. With these three campaigns, the JOF will be observed for 380 open-shutter hours with NIRCam using 15 imaging filters and 2 grism bandpasses. Further, parts of the JOF have deep 43 hr MIRI observations in F770W. Taken together, the JOF will soon be one of the most compelling deep fields available with JWST and a powerful window into the early Universe. This paper presents the second data release from JADES, featuring the imaging and catalogs from the year 1 JOF observations. |

|**Abstract**| Observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in distant quasar spectra with upcoming surveys are expected to provide significantly larger and higher-quality datasets. To interpret these datasets, it is imperative to develop efficient simulations. One such approach is based on the assumption that baryonic densities in the intergalactic medium (IGM) follow a lognormal distribution. We extend our earlier work to assess the robustness of the lognormal model of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in recovering the parameters characterizing IGM state, namely, the mean-density IGM temperature ($T_0$), the slope of the temperature-density relation ($\gamma$), and the hydrogen photoionization rate ($\Gamma_{12}$), by comparing with high-resolution Sherwood SPH simulations across the redshift range $2 \leq z \leq 2.7$. These parameters are estimated through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique, using the mean and power spectrum of the transmitted flux. We find that the usual lognormal distribution of IGM densities cannot recover the parameters of the SPH simulations. This limitation arises from the fact that the SPH baryonic density distribution cannot be described by a simple lognormal form. To address this, we extend the model by scaling the linear density contrast by a parameter $\nu$. While the resulting baryonic density is still lognormal, the additional parameter gives us extra freedom in setting the variance of density fluctuations. With this extension, values of $T_0$ and $\gamma$ implied in the SPH simulations are recovered at $\sim 1-\sigma$ ($\lesssim$ 10%) of the median (best-fit) values for most redshifts bins. However, this extended lognormal model cannot recover $\Gamma_{12}$ reliably, with the best-fit value discrepant by $\gtrsim 3-\sigma$ for $z > 2.2$. Despite this limitation in the recovery of $\Gamma_{12}$, we argue that the model remains useful for constraining cosmological parameters. |

|**Abstract**| Stellar-mass black holes (sBH) embedded in gaseous disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be important sources of detectable gravitational radiation for LIGO/Virgo when they form binaries and coalesce due to orbital decay. In this paper, we study the effect of gas dynamical friction (DF) on the formation of BH binaries in AGN disks using $N$-body simulations. We employ two simplified models of DF, with the force on the BH depending on $\Delta {\bf v}$, the velocity of the sBH relative to the background Keplerian gas. We integrate the motion of two sBH initially on circular orbits around the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), and evaluate the probability of binary formation under various conditions. We find that both models of DF (with different dependence of the frictional coefficient on $|\Delta{\bf v}|$) can foster the formation of binaries when the effective friction timescale $\tau$ satisfies $\Omega_{\rm K}\tau\lesssim 20-30$ (where $\Omega_{\rm K}$ is the Keplerian frequency around the SMBH): prograde binaries are formed when the DF is stronger (smaller $\tau$), while retrograde binaries dominate when the DF is weaker (larger $\tau$). We determine the distribution of both prograde and retrograde binaries as a function of initial orbital separation and the DF strength. Using our models of DF, we show that for a given sBH number density in the AGN disk, the formation rate of sBH binaries increases with decreasing $\tau$ and can reach a moderate value with a sufficiently strong DF. |

|**Abstract**| Evidence abounds that young stellar objects undergo luminous bursts of intense accretion that are short compared to the time it takes to form a star. It remains unclear how much these events contribute to the main-sequence masses of the stars. We demonstrate the power of time-series far-infrared (far-IR) photometry to answer this question compared to similar observations at shorter and longer wavelengths. We start with model spectral energy distributions that have been fit to 86 Class 0 protostars in the Orion molecular clouds. The protostars sample a broad range of envelope densities, cavity geometries, and viewing angles. We then increase the luminosity of each model by factors of 10, 50, and 100 and assess how these luminosity increases manifest in the form of flux increases over wavelength ranges of interest. We find that the fractional change in the far-IR luminosity during a burst more closely traces the change in the accretion rate than photometric diagnostics at mid-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths. We also show that observations at far-IR and longer wavelengths reliably track accretion changes without confusion from large, variable circumstellar and interstellar extinction that plague studies at shorter wavelengths. We close by discussing the ability of a proposed far-IR surveyor for the 2030s to enable improvements in our understanding of the role of accretion bursts in mass assembly. |

|**Abstract**| Machine learning has rapidly become a tool of choice for the astronomical community. It is being applied across a wide range of wavelengths and problems, from the classification of transients to neural network emulators of cosmological simulations, and is shifting paradigms about how we generate and report scientific results. At the same time, this class of method comes with its own set of best practices, challenges, and drawbacks, which, at present, are often reported on incompletely in the astrophysical literature. With this paper, we aim to provide a primer to the astronomical community, including authors, reviewers, and editors, on how to implement machine learning models and report their results in a way that ensures the accuracy of the results, reproducibility of the findings, and usefulness of the method. |
