|**Abstract**|            Thanks to decades of observations using HST, the structure of galaxies at redshift $z>2$ has been widely studied in the rest-frame ultraviolet regime, which traces recent star formation from young stellar populations. But, we still have little information about the spatial distribution of the older, more evolved, stellar populations, constrained by the rest-frame infrared portion of galaxies' spectral energy distribution. We present the morphological characterization of a sample of 21 massive galaxies ($\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})>9.5$) at redshift $3<z<5.5$. These galaxies are observed as part of the GTO program MIDIS with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard JWST. The deep MIRI 5.6~$\mu$m imaging allows us to characterize for the first time the rest-frame near-infrared structure of galaxies beyond cosmic noon, at higher redshifts than possible with NIRCam, tracing their older stellar populations. We derive the galaxies' non-parametric morphology and model the galaxies' light distribution with a SÃ©rsic component. We find that at $z>3$ massive galaxies show a smooth distribution of their rest-infrared light, strongly supporting the increasing number of regular disk galaxies already in place at early epochs. On the contrary, the ultraviolet structure obtained from HST observations is generally more irregular, catching the most recent episodes of star formation. Importantly, we find a segregation of morphologies across cosmic time, having massive galaxies at redshift $z>4$ later-type morphologies compared to $z\sim3$ galaxies. These findings suggest a transition phase in galaxy assembly and central mass build up already taking place at $z\sim3-4$. MIRI provides unique information about the structure of the mature stellar population of high-redshift galaxies, unveiling that massive galaxies beyond cosmic noon are prevalently compact disk galaxies with smooth mass distribution.         |

|**Abstract**|            The hierarchical model of galaxy evolution suggests that the impact of mergers is substantial on the intricate processes that drive stellar assembly within a galaxy. However, accurately measuring the contribution of accretion to a galaxy's total stellar mass and its balance with in-situ star formation poses a persistent challenge, as it is neither directly observable nor easily inferred from observational properties. Here, we present theory-motivated predictions for the fraction of stellar mass originating from mergers in a statistically significant sample of nearby galaxies, using data from MaNGA. Employing a robust machine learning model trained on mock MaNGA analogs (MaNGIA) in turn obtained from a cosmological simulation (TNG50), we unveil that in-situ stellar mass dominates almost across the entire stellar mass spectrum (1e9Msun < M* < 1e12Msun). Only in more massive galaxies (M* > 1e11Msun) does accreted mass become a substantial contributor, reaching up to 35-40% of the total stellar mass. Notably, the ex-situ stellar mass in the nearby universe exhibits significant dependence on galaxy characteristics, with higher accreted fractions favored by elliptical, quenched galaxies and slow rotators, as well as galaxies at the center of more massive dark matter halos.         |

|**Abstract**|            The way in which mergers affect galaxy formation depends on both feedback processes, and on the geometry and strength of the mergers themselves. We introduce the PARADIGM project, where we study the response of a simulated Milky-Way-mass galaxy forming in a cosmological setting to differing merger histories, using genetically modified initial conditions. Each initial condition is simulated with the VINTERGATAN and IllustrisTNG codes. While VINTERGATAN has been developed with an emphasis on resolving the cold interstellar medium, IllustrisTNG uses a subgrid two-phase model and consequently scales to large volume simulations, making them ideal to examine complementary views on how merger histories and feedback interact. Our genetic modifications alter the mass ratio of an important $z \approx 2$ merger while maintaining the halo's $z=0$ mass. Whether simulated with VINTERGATAN or IllustrisTNG, smaller mass ratios for this early merger result in larger galaxies at $z=0$, due to a greater build up of a kinematically cold disc. We conclude that such broad trends are robustly reproducible; however, the normalization of the resulting stellar sizes is substantially different in the two codes (ranging between $0.5-1.7\ \rm{kpc}$ for VINTERGATAN but $1.3-7.0\ \rm{kpc}$ for IllustrisTNG). The VINTERGATAN galaxies systematically form stars earlier, leading to a larger bulge component. Despite the difference in size normalization, both simulation suites lie on the observed size-mass relation for their respective morphological types. In light of these results, we discuss the interplay between internal processes and large scale gravitational interactions and gas accretion, and how the two galaxy models converge on similar emergent trends but along different evolutionary pathways.         |

|**Abstract**|            Using new continuum and molecular line data from the ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming Regions (ATOMS) survey and archival VLA, 4.86 GHz data, we present direct observational evidence of hierarchical triggering relating three epochs of massive star formation in a ring-like H II region, G24.47+0.49. We find from radio flux analysis that it is excited by a massive star(s) of spectral type O8.5V-O8V from the first epoch of star formation. The swept-up ionized ring structure shows evidence of secondary collapse, and within this ring a burst of massive star formation is observed in different evolutionary phases, which constitutes the second epoch. ATOMS spectral line (e.g., HCO$^+$(1-0)) observations reveal an outer concentric molecular gas ring expanding at a velocity of $\sim$ 9 $\rm km\,s^{-1}$, constituting the direct and unambiguous detection of an expanding molecular ring. It harbors twelve dense molecular cores with surface mass density greater than 0.05 $\rm g\,cm^{-2}$, a threshold typical of massive star formation. Half of them are found to be subvirial, and thus in gravitational collapse, making them third epoch of potential massive star-forming sites.         |

|**Abstract**|            The shape of the dark matter (DM) halo is key to understanding the hierarchical formation of the Galaxy. Despite extensive efforts in recent decades, however, its shape remains a matter of debate, with suggestions ranging from strongly oblate to prolate. Here, we present a new constraint on its present shape by directly measuring the evolution of the Galactic disk warp with time, as traced by accurate distance estimates and precise age determinations for about 2,600 classical Cepheids. We show that the Galactic warp is mildly precessing in a retrograde direction at a rate of $\omega = -2.1 \pm 0.5 ({\rm statistical}) \pm 0.6 ({\rm systematic})$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ for the outer disk over the Galactocentric radius [$7.5, 25$] kpc, decreasing with radius. This constrains the shape of the DM halo to be slightly oblate with a flattening (minor axis to major axis ratio) in the range $0.84 \le q_{\Phi} \le 0.96$. Given the young nature of the disk warp traced by Cepheids (less than 200 Myr), our approach directly measures the shape of the present-day DM halo. This measurement, combined with other measurements from older tracers, could provide vital constraints on the evolution of the DM halo and the assembly history of the Galaxy.         |

|**Abstract**|            We installed the next-generation automated laser adaptive optics system, Robo-AO-2, on the University of Hawaii 2.2-m telescope on Maunakea in 2023. We engineered Robo-AO-2 to deliver robotic, diffraction-limited observations at visible and near-infrared wavelengths in unprecedented numbers. This new instrument takes advantage of upgraded components, manufacturing techniques and control; and includes a parallel reconfigurable natural guide star wavefront sensor with which to explore hybrid wavefront sensing techniques. We present the results of commissioning in 2023 and 2024.         |

|| <mark>K. Lee</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-07-03*|
|*Comments*| *16 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the [C II] 158 $\mu$m line and the underlying continuum emission of TN J0924$-$2201, which is one of the most distant known radio galaxies at $z>5$. The [C II] line and 1-mm continuum emission are detected at the host galaxy. The systemic redshift derived from the [C II] line is $z_{\rm [C II]}=5.1736\pm0.0002$, indicating that the Ly$\alpha$ line is redshifted by a velocity of $1035\pm10$ km s$^{-1}$, marking the largest velocity offset between the [C II] and Ly$\alpha$ lines recorded at $z>5$ to date. In the central region of the host galaxy, we identified a redshifted substructure of [C II] with a velocity of $702\pm17$ km s$^{-1}$, which is close to the CIV line with a velocity of $500\pm10$ km s$^{-1}$. The position and the velocity offsets align with a model of an outflowing shell structure, consistent with the large velocity offset of Ly$\alpha$. The non-detection of [C II] and dust emission from the three CO(1--0)-detected companions indicates their different nature compared to dwarf galaxies based on the photodissociation region model. Given their large velocity of $\sim1500$ km s$^{-1}$, outflowing molecular clouds induced by the AGN is the most plausible interpretation, and they may exceed the escape velocity of a $10^{13}\,M_{\odot}$ halo. These results suggest that TN J0924$-$2201, with the ongoing and fossil large-scale outflows, is in a distinctive phase of removing molecular gas from a central massive galaxy in an overdense region in the early universe. A dusty HI absorber at the host galaxy is an alternative interpretation.         |

|*Comments*| *8 pages, 8 figures, presented at 2024 SPIE Astronomical Telescopes + Instrumentation conference*|
|**Abstract**|            Low sky brightness is crucial for ground-based astronomical observations, because it limits the observational capability to detect fainter sources. Lenghu, located on the Tibetan Plateau in China, has been identified as an high-quality astronomical site in China, including dark sky in optical band. In this work, we will report the preliminary results of near-infrared sky brightness measurements at Lenghu. Utilizing a wide-field small telescope equipped with an InGaAs camera, we have been conducting long-term monitoring of near-infrared sky brightness in the J and H' bands, respectively, since January 2024. For each image, photometry and astrometry were performed, then sky background was calibrated by standard stars from the 2MASS catalog. This report includes preliminary results on the sky brightness at zenith in the J and H' bands, as well as their variations with solar elevation at Lenghu. Our initial results indicate that the near-infrared sky brightness at Lenghu is comparable to that of other world-class sites, and long-term monitoring will be continued.         |

|**Abstract**|            The high-energy radiative output, from the X-ray to the ultraviolet, of exoplanet host stars drives photochemical reactions and mass loss in the upper regions of planetary atmospheres. In order to place constraints on the atmospheric properties of the three closest terrestrial exoplanets transiting M dwarfs, we observe the high-energy spectra of the host stars LTT1445A and GJ486 in the X-ray with XMM-Newton and Chandra and in the ultraviolet with HST/COS and STIS. We combine these observations with estimates of extreme ultraviolet flux, reconstructions of the Ly-a lines, and stellar models at optical and infrared wavelengths to produce panchromatic spectra from 1A--20um for each star. While LTT1445Ab, LTT1445Ac, and GJ486b do not possess primordial hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, we calculate that they are able to retain pure CO2 atmospheres if starting with 10, 15, and 50% of Earth's total CO2 budget, respectively, in the presence of their host stars' stellar wind. We use age-activity relationships to place lower limits of 2.2 and 6.6 Gyr on the ages of the host stars LTT1445A and GJ486. Despite both LTT1445A and GJ486 appearing inactive at optical wavelengths, we detect flares at ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths for both stars. In particular, GJ486 exhibits two flares with absolute energies of 10^29.5 and 10^30.1 erg (equivalent durations of 4357+/-96 and 19724+/-169 s) occurring three hours apart, captured with HST/COS G130M. Based on the timing of the observations, we suggest that these high-energy flares are related and indicative of heightened flaring activity that lasts for a period of days, but our interpretations are limited by sparse time-sampling. Consistent high-energy monitoring is needed to determine the duration and extent of high-energy activity on individual M dwarfs, as well as the population as a whole.         |

|**Abstract**|            Submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths provide a unique view of the Universe, from the gas and dust that fills and surrounds galaxies to the chromosphere of our own Sun. Current single-dish facilities have presented a tantalising view of the brightest (sub-)mm sources, and interferometers have provided the exquisite resolution necessary to analyse the details in small fields, but there are still many open questions that cannot be answered with current facilities. In this report we summarise the science that is guiding the design of the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST). We demonstrate how tranformational advances in topics including star formation in high redshift galaxies, the diffuse circumgalactic medium, Galactic ecology, cometary compositions and solar flares motivate the need for a 50m, single-dish telescope with a 1-2 degree field of view and a new generation of highly multiplexed continuum and spectral cameras. AtLAST will have the resolution to drastically lower the confusion limit compared to current single-dish facilities, whilst also being able to rapidly map large areas of the sky and detect extended, diffuse structures. Its high sensitivity and large field of view will open up the field of submillimeter transient science by increasing the probability of serendipitous detections. Finally, the science cases listed here motivate the need for a highly flexible operations model capable of short observations of individual targets, large surveys, monitoring programmes, target of opportunity observations and coordinated observations with other observatories. AtLAST aims to be a sustainable, upgradeable, multipurpose facility that will deliver orders of magnitude increases in sensitivity and mapping speeds over current and planned submillimeter observatories.         |

|| J. L. May, et al. -- incl., <mark>S. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-07-03*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            Taurus is a balloon-borne cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment optimized to map the E-mode polarization and Galactic foregrounds at the largest angular scales ($\ell$ $\lt$ 30) and improve measurements of the optical depth to reionization ($\tau$). This will pave the way for improved measurements of the sum of neutrino masses in combination with high-resolution CMB data while also testing the $\Lambda CDM$ model on large angular scales and providing high-frequency maps of polarized dust foregrounds to the CMB community. These measurements take advantage of the low-loading environment found in the stratosphere and are enabled by NASA's super-pressure balloon platform, which provides access to 70% of the sky with a launch from Wanaka, New Zealand. Here we describe a general overview of Taurus, with an emphasis on the instrument design. Taurus will employ more than 10,000 100 mK transition edge sensor bolometers distributed across two low-frequency (150, 220 GHz) and one high-frequency (280, 350 GHz) dichroic receivers. The liquid helium cryostat housing the detectors and optics is supported by a lightweight gondola. The payload is designed to meet the challenges in mass, power, and thermal control posed by the super-pressure platform. The instrument and scan strategy are optimized for rigorous control of instrumental systematics, enabling high-fidelity linear polarization measurements on the largest angular scales.         |
