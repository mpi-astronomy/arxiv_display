|**Abstract**|            We present new JWST observations of the nearby, prototypical edge-on, spiral galaxy NGC 891. The northern half of the disk was observed with NIRCam in its F150W and F277W filters. Absorption is clearly visible in the mid-plane of the F150W image, along with vertical dusty plumes that closely resemble the ones seen in the optical. A $\sim 10 \times 3~{\rm kpc}^2$ area of the lower circumgalactic medium (CGM) was mapped with MIRI F770W at 12 pc scales. Thanks to the sensitivity and resolution of JWST, we detect dust emission out to $\sim 4$ kpc from the disk, in the form of filaments, arcs, and super-bubbles. Some of these filaments can be traced back to regions with recent star formation activity, suggesting that feedback-driven galactic winds play an important role in regulating baryonic cycling. The presence of dust at these altitudes raises questions about the transport mechanisms at play and suggests that small dust grains are able to survive for several tens of million years after having been ejected by galactic winds in the disk-halo interface. We lay out several scenarios that could explain this emission: dust grains may be shielded in the outer layers of cool dense clouds expelled from the galaxy disk, and/or the emission comes from the mixing layers around these cool clumps where material from the hot gas is able to cool down and mix with these cool cloudlets. This first set of data and upcoming spectroscopy will be very helpful to understand the survival of dust grains in energetic environments, and their contribution to recycling baryonic material in the mid-plane of galaxies.         |

|**Abstract**|            We use data from the ALMA Evolutionary Study of High Mass Protocluster Formation in the Galaxy (ALMAGAL) survey to study 100 ALMAGAL regions at $\sim$ 1\arcsec~ resolution located between $\sim$ 2 and 6~kpc distance. Using ALMAGAL $\sim$ 1.3mm line and continuum data we estimate flow rates onto individual cores. We focus specifically on flow rates along filamentary structures associated with these cores. Our primary analysis is centered around position velocity cuts in H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$ - 2$_{0,2}$) which allow us to measure the velocity fields, surrounding these cores. Combining this work with column density estimates we derive the flow rates along the extended filamentary structures associated with cores in these regions. We select a sample of 100 ALMAGAL regions covering four evolutionary stages from quiescent to protostellar, Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), and \HII~regions (25 each). Using dendrogram and line analysis, we identify a final sample of 182 cores in 87 regions. In this paper, we present 728 flow rates for our sample (4 per core), analysed in the context of evolutionary stage, distance from the core, and core mass. On average, for the whole sample, we derive flow rates on the order of $\sim$10$^{-4}$ M$_{sun}$yr$^{-1}$ with estimated uncertainties of $\pm$50\%. We see increasing differences in the values among evolutionary stages, most notably between the less evolved (quiescent/protostellar) and more evolved (YSO/\HII~region) sources. We also see an increasing trend as we move further away from the centre of these cores. We also find a clear relationship between the flow rates and core masses $\sim$M$^{2/3}$ which is in line with the result expected from the tidal-lobe accretion mechanism. Overall, we see increasing trends in the relationships between the flow rate and the three investigated parameters; evolutionary stage, distance from the core, and core mass.         |

|**Abstract**|            Observations of ionic, atomic, or molecular lines are performed to improve our understanding of the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the potential of a line to constrain the physical conditions of the ISM is difficult to assess quantitatively, because of the complexity of the ISM physics. The situation is even more complex when trying to assess which combinations of lines are the most useful. Therefore, observation campaigns usually try to observe as many lines as possible for as much time as possible. We search for a quantitative statistical criterion to evaluate the constraining power of a (or combination of) tracer(s) with respect to physical conditions in order to improve our understanding of the statistical relationships between ISM tracers and physical conditions and helps observers to motivate their observation proposals. The best tracers are obtained by comparing the mutual information between a physical parameter and different sets of lines. We apply this method to simulations of radio molecular lines emitted by a photodissociation region similar to the Horsehead Nebula that would be observed at the IRAM 30m telescope. We search for the best lines to constrain the visual extinction $A_v^{tot}$ or the far UV illumination $G_0$. The most informative lines change with the physical regime (e.g., cloud extinction). Short integration time of the CO isotopologue $J=1-0$ lines already yields much information on the total column density most regimes. The best set of lines to constrain the visual extinction does not necessarily combine the most informative individual lines. Precise constraints on $G_0$ are more difficult to achieve with molecular lines. They require spectral lines emitted at the cloud surface (e.g., [CII] and [CI] lines). This approach allows one to better explore the knowledge provided by ISM codes, and to guide future observation campaigns.         |

|**Abstract**|            Early JWST studies found an apparent population of massive, compact galaxies at redshifts $z\gtrsim7$. Recently three of these galaxies were shown to have prominent Balmer breaks, demonstrating that their light at $\lambda_{\rm rest} \sim 3500$ $Å$ is dominated by a stellar population that is relatively old ($\sim$200 Myr). All three also have broad H$\beta$ emission with $\sigma > 1000 \,\rm km s^{-1}$, a common feature of such `little red dots'. From Sérsic profile fits to the NIRCam images in F200W we find that the stellar light of galaxies is extremely compact: the galaxies have half-light radii of $r_{\rm e}\sim$ 100 pc, in the regime of ultra compact dwarfs in the nearby Universe. Their masses are uncertain, as they depend on the contribution of possible light from an AGN to the flux at $\lambda_{\rm rest}>5000$ $Å$. If the AGN contribution is low beyond the Balmer break region, the masses are $M_* \sim 10^{10}-10^{11}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, and the central densities are higher than those of any other known galaxy population by an order of magnitude. Interestingly, the implied velocity dispersions of $\sim$1500 kms$^{-1}$ are in very good agreement with the measured H$\beta$ line widths. We suggest that some of the broad lines in `little red dots' are not due to AGNs but simply reflect the kinematics of the galaxies, and speculate that the galaxies are observed in a short-lived phase where the central densities are much higher than at later times. We stress, however, that the canonical interpretation of AGNs causing the broad H$\beta$ lines also remains viable.         |
