|**Abstract**|            Deuterated molecules and their molecular D/H-ratios (RD(D)) are important diagnostic tools to study the physical conditions of star-forming regions. The degree of deuteration, RD(D), can be significantly enhanced over the elemental D/H-ratio depending on physical parameters. Within the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE), we aim to explore the large-scale distribution of deuterated molecules in the nearby Cygnus-X region. We focus on the analysis of large-scale structures of deuterated molecules in the filamentary region hosting the prominent Hii region DR21 and DR21(OH). Here we discuss the HCO+, HNC and HCN molecules and their deuterated isotopologues DCO+, DNC and DCN. The spatial distributions of integrated line emissions from DCO+, DNC, and DCN reveal morphological differences. DCO+ displays the most extended emission, characterized by several prominent peaks. Likewise, DNC exhibits multiple peaks, although its emission appears less extended compared to DCO+. In contrast to the extended emission of DCO+ and DNC, DCN appears the least extended, with distinct peaks. Focusing only on the regions where all three molecules are observed, the mean deuteration ratios for each species are 0.01 for both DNC and DCN, and = 0.005 for DCO+. Anti-correlations are found with deuterated molecules and dust temperature or N(H2). The strongest anti-correlation is found with RD(DCO+) and N(H2). The anti-correlation of RD(DCO+) and N(H2) is suggested to be a result of a combination of an increased photodissociation degree and shocks. A strong positive correlation between the ratio of integrated intensities of DCN and DNC with their 13C-isotopologues, are found in high column density regions. The positive relationship between the ratios implies that the D-isotopologue of the isomers could potentially serve as a tracer for the kinetic gas temperature.         |

|**Abstract**|            Of the many recently discovered terrestrial exoplanets, some are expected to harbor moderate water mass fractions of a few percent. The formation pathways that can produce planets with these water mass fractions are not fully understood. Here, we use the code chemcomp, which consists of a semi-analytical 1D protoplanetary disk model harboring a migrating and accreting planet, to model the growth and composition of planets with moderate water mass fractions by pebble accretion in a protoplanetary disk around a TRAPPIST-1 analog star. This star is accompanied by seven terrestrial planets, of which the outer four planets likely contain water mass fractions of between 1\% and 10\%. We adopt a published model that considers the evaporation of pebbles in the planetary envelope, from where recycling flows can transport the volatile vapor back into the disk. We find that with this model, the planetary water content depends on the influx rate of pebbles onto the planet. A decreasing pebble influx with time reduces the envelope temperature and consequently allows the formation of planets with moderate water mass fractions as inferred for the outer TRAPPIST-1 planets for a number of different simulation configurations. This is further evidence that the recycling of vapor is an important component of planet formation needed to explain the vast and diverse population of exoplanets.         |

|**Abstract**|            W49A is a prominent giant molecular cloud (GMC) that exhibits strong star formation activities, yet its structural and kinematic properties remain uncertain. Our study aims to investigate the large-scale structure and kinematics of W49A, and elucidate the role of filaments and hub-filament systems (HFSs) in its star formation activity. We utilized continuum data from Herschel and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) as well as the molecular lines 12CO (3-2), 13CO (3-2), and C18O (3-2) to identify filaments and HFS structures within W49A. Further analysis focused on the physical properties, kinematics, and mass transport within these structures. Additionally, recombination line emission from the H I/OH/Recombination (THOR) line survey was employed to trace the central H II region and ionized gas. Our findings reveal that W49A comprises one blue-shifted (B-S) HFS and one red-shifted (R-S) HFS, each with multiple filaments and dense hubs. Notably, significant velocity gradients were detected along these filaments, indicative of material transport toward the hubs. High mass accretion rates along the filaments facilitate the formation of massive stars in the HFSs. Furthermore, the presence of V-shaped structures around clumps in position-velocity diagrams suggests ongoing gravitational collapse and local star formation within the filaments. Our results indicate that W49A consists of one R-S HFS and one B-S HFS, and that the material transport from filaments to the hub promotes the formation of massive stars in the hub. These findings underscore the significance of HFSs in shaping the star formation history of W49A.         |

|**Abstract**|            Dense outflowing gas, traced by transitions of molecules with large dipole moment, is important for understanding mass loss and feedback of massive star formation. HCN 3-2 and HCO$^+$ 3-2 are good tracers of dense outflowing molecular gas, which are closely related to active star formation. In this study, we present on-the-fly (OTF) mapping observations of HCN 3-2 and HCO$^+$ 3-2 toward a sample of 33 massive star-forming regions using the 10-m Submillimeter Telescope (SMT). With the spatial distribution of line wings of HCO$^+$ 3-2 and HCN 3-2, outflows are detected in 25 sources, resulting in a detection rate of 76$\%$. The optically thin H$^{13}$CN and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ 3-2 lines are used to identify line wings as outflows and estimate core mass. The mass $M_{out}$, momentum $P_{out}$, kinetic energy $E_{K}$, force $F_{out}$ and mass loss rate $\dot M_{out}$ of outflow and core mass, are obtained for each source. A sublinear tight correlation is found between the mass of dense molecular outflow and core mass, with an index of $\sim$ 0.8 and a correlation coefficient of 0.88.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report on an observation of the difference between northern and southern skies of the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray energy spectrum with a significance of ${\sim}8\sigma$. We use measurements from the two largest experiments$\unicode{x2014}$the Telescope Array observing the northern hemisphere and the Pierre Auger Observatory viewing the southern hemisphere. Since the comparison of two measurements from different observatories introduces the issue of possible systematic differences between detectors and analyses, we validate the methodology of the comparison by examining the region of the sky where the apertures of the two observatories overlap. Although the spectra differ in this region, we find that there is only a $1.8\sigma$ difference between the spectrum measurements when anisotropic regions are removed and a fiducial cut in the aperture is applied.         |
