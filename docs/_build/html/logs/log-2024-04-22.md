|**Abstract**| We present an overview and first results from the Spectroscopic Ultradeep Survey Probing Extragalactic Near-infrared Stellar Emission (SUSPENSE), executed with NIRSpec on JWST. The primary goal of the SUSPENSE program is to characterize the stellar, chemical, and kinematic properties of massive quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon. In a single deep NIRSpec/MSA configuration, we target 20 distant quiescent galaxy candidates ($z=1-3$, $H_{AB}<23$), as well as 53 star-forming galaxies at $z=1-4$. With 16hr of integration and the G140M-F100LP dispersion-filter combination, we observe numerous Balmer and metal absorption lines for all quiescent candidates. We derive stellar masses (log$M_*/M_{\odot}\sim10.3-11.5$) and detailed star-formation histories (SFHs) and show that all 20 candidate quiescent galaxies indeed have quenched stellar populations. These galaxies show a variety of mass-weighted ages ($0.8-3.0$Gyr) and star formation timescales ($\sim0.5-4$Gyr), and four out of 20 galaxies were already quiescent by $z=3$. On average, the $z>1.75$ $[z<1.75]$ galaxies formed 50% of their stellar mass before $z=4$ $[z=3]$. Furthermore, the typical SFHs of galaxies in these two redshift bins ($z_{\text{mean}}=2.2$ and $z_{\text{mean}}=1.3$) indicate that galaxies at higher redshift formed earlier and over shorter star-formation timescales compared to lower redshifts. Although this evolution is naturally explained by the growth of the quiescent galaxy population over cosmic time, we cannot rule out that mergers and late-time star formation also contribute to the evolution. In future work, we will further unravel the early formation, quenching, and late-time evolution of these galaxies by extending this work with studies on their chemical abundances, |

|**Abstract**| Although the mass growth of supermassive black holes during the Epoch of Reionisation is expected to play a role in shaping the concurrent growth of their host-galaxies, observational evidence of feedback at z$\gtrsim$6 is still sparse. We perform the first multi-scale and multi-phase characterisation of black-hole driven outflows in the $z\sim6.6$ quasar J0923+0402 and assess how these winds impact the cold gas reservoir. We employ the SimBAL spectral synthesis to fit broad absorption line (BAL) features and find a powerful ionized outflow on $\lesssim210$ pc scale, with a kinetic power $\sim2-100$\% of the quasar luminosity. ALMA observations of [CII] emission allow us to study the morphology and kinematics of the cold gas. We detect high-velocity [CII] emission, likely associated with a cold neutral outflow at $\sim0.5-2$ kpc scale in the host-galaxy, and a bright extended [CII] halo with a size of $\sim15$ kpc. For the first time at such an early epoch, we accurately constrain the outflow energetics in both the ionized and the atomic neutral gas phases. We find such energetics to be consistent with expectations for an efficient feedback mechanism, and both ejective and preventative feedback modes are likely at play. The scales and energetics of the ionized and atomic outflows suggest that they might be associated with different quasar accretion episodes. The results of this work indicate that strong black hole feedback is occurring in quasars at $z\gtrsim6$ and is likely responsible for shaping the properties of the cold gas reservoir up to circum-galactic scales. |

|**Abstract**| The attenuation of Ly$\alpha$ photons by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) at $z\gtrsim5$ continues to be a powerful probe for studying the epoch of reionisation. Given a framework to estimate the intrinsic (true) Ly$\alpha$ emission of high-$z$ sources, one can infer the ionisation state of the IGM during reionisation. In this work, we use the enlarged XQR-30 sample of 42 high-resolution and high-SNR QSO spectra between $5.8\lesssim\,z\lesssim\,6.6$ obtained with VLT/X-Shooter to place constraints on the IGM neutral fraction. This is achieved using our existing Bayesian QSO reconstruction framework which accounts for uncertainties such as the: (i) posterior distribution of predicted intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ emission profiles (obtained via covariance matrix reconstruction of the Ly$\alpha$ and N V emission lines from unattenuated high-ionisation emission line profiles; C IV, Si IV + O IV] and C III]) and (ii) distribution of ionised regions within the IGM using synthetic damping wing profiles drawn from a $1.6^3$ Gpc$^3$ reionisation simulation. Following careful quality control, we used 23 of the 42 available QSOs to obtain constraints/limits on the IGM neutral fraction during the tail-end of reionisation. Our median and 68th percentile constraints on the IGM neutral fraction are: $0.20\substack{+0.14\\-0.12}$ and $0.29\substack{+0.14\\-0.13}$ at $z = 6.15$~and 6.35. Further, we also report 68th percentile upper-limits of $\bar{x}_{\mathrm{H\,{\scriptscriptstyle I}}} < 0.21$, 0.20, 0.21 and 0.18 at $z = 5.8, 5.95, 6.05$~and 6.55. These results imply reionisation is still ongoing at $5.8\lesssim\,z\lesssim\,6.55$, consistent with previous results from XQR-30 (dark fraction and Ly$\alpha$ forest) along with other observational probes considered in the literature. |

|**Abstract**| We present the analysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-0845, which was affected by both the microlensing parallax and xallarap effects. The former was detected via the simultaneous observations from the ground and Spitzer, and the latter was caused by the orbital motion of the source star in a relatively close binary. The combination of these two effects led to a direct mass measurement of the lens object, revealing a low-mass ($0.14 \pm 0.05 M_{\odot}$) M-dwarf at the bulge distance ($7.6 \pm 1.0$ kpc). The source binary consists of a late F-type subgiant and a K-type dwarf of $\sim1.2 M_{\odot}$ and $\sim 0.9 M_{\odot}$, respectively, and the orbital period is $70 \pm 10$ days. OGLE-2015-BLG-0845 is the first single-lens event in which the lens mass is measured via the binarity of the source. Given the abundance of binary systems as potential microlensing sources, the xallarap effect may not be a rare phenomenon. Our work thus highlights the application of the xallarap effect in the mass determination of microlenses, and the same method can be used to identify isolated dark lenses. |

|**Abstract**| In this paper, we presented a detailed analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical spectrum of a new sub-kpc scale dual AGN candidate SDSS J222428.53+261423.2 (=SDSS J2224). The target is one of the few AGNs with all the optical narrow emission lines characterized by double-peaked profiles and with peak separations in velocity units of about 930 km/s. If the double-peaked narrow emission lines (DPNELs) are due to a dual AGN in \obj, the estimated physical separation between the two cores is about 500 pc. Meanwhile, three alternative explanations are also discussed in this paper, however, we can not find solid evidence to completely rule them out. Our results support the presence of a sub-kpc dual AGN with DPNELs in all lines, indicating a key episode of galaxy merging evolution at sub-kpc scale. |

|| <mark>K. El-Badry</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-04-22*|
|*Comments*| *7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to OJAp. Comments welcome*|
|**Abstract**| A $33\,M_\odot$ black hole (BH) was recently discovered in an 11.6-year binary only 590 pc from the Sun. The system, Gaia BH3, contains a $0.8\,M_\odot$ low-metallicity giant ($\rm [M/H]=-2.2$) and is kinematically part of the Galactic halo, suggesting that the BH formed from a low-metallicity massive star. I show that orbits similar to that of Gaia BH3 are naturally produced through isolated binary evolution. The system's period and eccentricity can result from a broad range of initial orbits with a modest natal kick ($v_{\rm kick}\lesssim 75\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$) to the BH. I construct MESA models for metal-poor massive stars with initial masses ranging from $35-55\,M_{\odot}$, which reach maximum radii of $1150-1800\,R_{\odot}$ as red supergiants. Stars of this size would fit inside most plausible pre-supernova orbits for the system without overflowing their Roche lobes. In addition, models with moderately rapid initial rotation ($\Omega/\Omega_{\rm crit} \gtrsim 0.45$) undergo chemically homogeneous evolution and never expand to radii larger than $10\,R_{\odot}$. There are thus multiple channels through which a low-metallicity, extreme-mass ratio binary could produce a system like Gaia BH3. Dynamical formation scenarios are also viable, and there is little doubt that both isolated and dynamically-formed BH binaries with orbits similar to Gaia BH3 will be discovered in Gaia DR4. Only about 1 in 10,000 stars in the solar neighborhood have metallicities as low as Gaia BH3. This suggests that BH companions are dramatically over-represented at low-metallicity, though caveats related to small number statistics apply. The fact that the luminous star in Gaia BH3 has been a giant - greatly boosting its detectability - only for $\sim$1% of the time since the system's formation implies that additional massive BHs remain to be discovered with only moderately fainter companions. |
