|**Abstract**| We present new astrometric and polarimetric observations of flares from Sgr A* obtained with GRAVITY, the near-infrared interferometer at ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), bringing the total sample of well-covered astrometric flares to four and polarimetric ones to six, where we have for two flares good coverage in both domains. All astrometric flares show clockwise motion in the plane of the sky with a period of around an hour, and the polarization vector rotates by one full loop in the same time. Given the apparent similarities of the flares, we present a common fit, taking into account the absence of strong Doppler boosting peaks in the light curves and the EHT-measured geometry. Our results are consistent with and significantly strengthen our model from 2018: We find that a) the combination of polarization period and measured flare radius of around nine gravitational radii ($9 R_g \approx 1.5 R_{ISCO}$, innermost stable circular orbit) is consistent with Keplerian orbital motion of hot spots in the innermost accretion zone. The mass inside the flares' radius is consistent with the $4.297 \times 10^6 \; \text{M}_\odot$ measured from stellar orbits at several thousand $R_g$. This finding and the diameter of the millimeter shadow of Sgr A* thus support a single black hole model. Further, b) the magnetic field configuration is predominantly poloidal (vertical), and the flares' orbital plane has a moderate inclination with respect to the plane of the sky, as shown by the non-detection of Doppler-boosting and the fact that we observe one polarization loop per astrometric loop. Moreover, c) both the position angle on sky and the required magnetic field strength suggest that the accretion flow is fueled and controlled by the winds of the massive, young stars of the clockwise stellar disk 1-5 arcsec from Sgr A*, in agreement with recent simulations. |

|**Abstract**| [Abridged] It is expected that the ongoing and future space-borne planet survey missions including TESS, PLATO, and Earth 2.0 will detect thousands of small to medium-sized planets via the transit technique, including over a hundred habitable terrestrial rocky planets. To conduct a detailed study of these terrestrial planets, particularly the cool ones with wide orbits, the exoplanet community has proposed various follow-up missions. The currently proposed ESA mission ARIEL is capable of characterization of planets down to warm super-Earths mainly using transmission spectroscopy. The NASA 6m UV/Opt/NIR mission proposed in the Astro2020 Decadal Survey may further tackle down to habitable rocky planets, and is expected to launch around 2045. In the meanwhile, China is funding a concept study of a 6-m class space telescope named Tianlin (A UV/Opt/NIR Large Aperture Space Telescope) that aims to start its operation within the next 10-15 years and last for 5+ years. Tianlin will be primarily aimed to the discovery and characterization of rocky planets in the habitable zones (HZ) around nearby stars and to search for potential biosignatures mainly using the direct imaging method. Transmission and emission spectroscopy at moderate to high resolution will be carried out as well on a population of exoplanets to strengthen the understanding of the formation and evolution of exoplanets. It will also carry out in-depth studies of the cosmic web and early galaxies, and constrain the nature of the dark matter and dark energy. We describe briefly the primary scientific motivations and main technical considerations based on our preliminary simulation results. We find that a monolithic off-axis space telescope with a primary mirror diameter larger than 6m equipped with a high contrast chronograph can identify water in the atmosphere of a habitable-zone Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star. |

|**Abstract**| Terrestrial and sub-Neptune planets are expected to form in the inner ($<10~$AU) regions of protoplanetary disks. Water plays a key role in their formation, although it is yet unclear whether water molecules are formed in-situ or transported from the outer disk. So far Spitzer Space Telescope observations have only provided water luminosity upper limits for dust-depleted inner disks, similar to PDS 70, the first system with direct confirmation of protoplanet presence. Here we report JWST observations of PDS 70, a benchmark target to search for water in a disk hosting a large ($\sim54~$AU) planet-carved gap separating an inner and outer disk. Our findings show water in the inner disk of PDS 70. This implies that potential terrestrial planets forming therein have access to a water reservoir. The column densities of water vapour suggest in-situ formation via a reaction sequence involving O, H$_2$, and/or OH, and survival through water self-shielding. This is also supported by the presence of CO$_2$ emission, another molecule sensitive to UV photodissociation. Dust shielding, and replenishment of both gas and small dust from the outer disk, may also play a role in sustaining the water reservoir. Our observations also reveal a strong variability of the mid-infrared spectral energy distribution, pointing to a change of inner disk geometry. |

|**Abstract**| Early results from the JWST-MIRI guaranteed time programs on protostars (JOYS) and disks (MINDS) are presented. Thanks to the increased sensitivity, spectral and spatial resolution of the MIRI spectrometer, the chemical inventory of the planet-forming zones in disks can be investigated with unprecedented detail across stellar mass range and age. Here data are presented for five disks, four around low-mass stars and one around a very young high-mass star. The mid-infrared spectra show some similarities but also significant diversity: some sources are rich in CO2, others in H2O or C2H2. In one disk around a very low-mass star, booming C2H2 emission provides evidence for a ``soot'' line at which carbon grains are eroded and sublimated, leading to a rich hydrocarbon chemistry in which even di-acetylene (C4H2) and benzene (C6H6) are detected (Tabone et al. 2023). Together, the data point to an active inner disk gas-phase chemistry that is closely linked to the physical structure (temperature, snowlines, presence of cavities and dust traps) of the entire disk and which may result in varying CO2/H2O abundances and high C/O ratios >1 in some cases. Ultimately, this diversity in disk chemistry will also be reflected in the diversity of the chemical composition of exoplanets. |
