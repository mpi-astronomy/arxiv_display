|**Abstract**| Observations of debris disks have significantly improved over the past decades, both in terms of sensitivity and spatial resolution. At near-infrared wavelengths, new observing strategies and post-processing algorithms allow us to drastically improve the final images, revealing faint structures in the disks. These structures inform us about the properties and spatial distribution of the small dust particles. We present new $H$-band observations of the disk around HD 129590, which display an intriguing arc-like structure in total intensity but not in polarimetry, and propose an explanation for the origin of this arc. Assuming geometric parameters for the birth ring of planetesimals, our model provides the positions of millions of particles of different sizes to compute scattered light images. We demonstrate that if the grain size distribution is truncated or strongly peaks at a size larger than the radiation pressure blow-out size we are able to produce an arc quite similar to the observed one. If the birth ring is radially narrow, given that particles of a given size have similar eccentricities, they will have their apocenters at the same distance from the star. Since this is where the particles will spend most of their time, this results in a "apocenter pile-up" that can look like a ring. Due to more efficient forward scattering this arc only appears in total intensity observations and remains undetected in polarimetric data. This scenario requires sharp variations either in the grain size distribution or for the scattering efficiencies $Q_\mathrm{sca}$. Alternative possibilities such as a wavy size distribution and a size-dependent phase function are interesting candidates to strengthen the apocenter pile-up. We also discuss why such arcs are not commonly detected in other systems, which can mainly be explained by the fact that most parent belts are usually broad. |

|**Abstract**| The Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) provides a luminous standard candle for constructing distance ladders to measure the Hubble constant. In practice its measurements via edge-detection response (EDR) are complicated by the apparent fuzziness of the tip and the multi-peak landscape of the EDR. As a result, it can be difficult to replicate due to a case-by-case measurement process. Previously we optimized an unsupervised algorithm, Comparative Analysis of TRGBs (CATs), to minimize the variance among multiple halo fields per host without reliance on individualized choices, achieving state-of-the-art $\sim$ $<$ 0.05 mag distance measures for optimal data. Further, we found an empirical correlation at 5$\sigma$ confidence in the GHOSTS halo survey between our measurements of the tip and their contrast ratios (ratio of stars 0.5 mag just below and above the tip), useful for standardizing the apparent tips at different host locations. Here, we apply this algorithm to an expanded sample of SN Ia hosts to standardize these to multiple fields in the geometric anchor, NGC 4258. In concert with the Pantheon$+$ SN Ia sample, this analysis produces a (baseline) result of $H_0= 73.22 \pm 2.06$ km/s/Mpc. The largest difference in $H_0$ between this and similar studies employing the TRGB derives from corrections for SN survey differences and local flows used in most recent SN Ia compilations but which were absent in earlier studies. SN-related differences total $\sim$ 2.0 km/s/Mpc. A smaller share, $\sim$ 1.4 km/s/Mpc, results from the inhomogeneity of the TRGB calibration across the distance ladder. We employ a grid of 108 variants around the optimal TRGB algorithm and find the median of variants is $72.94\pm1.98$ km/s/Mpc with an additional uncertainty due to algorithm choices of 0.83 km/s/Mpc. None of these TRGB variants result in $H_0$ less than 71.6 km/s/Mpc. |
