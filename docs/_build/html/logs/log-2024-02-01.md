|**Abstract**| Temporal variability in the photometric and spectroscopic properties of protoplanetary disks is common in YSO. However, evidence pointing toward changes in their morphology over short timescales has only been found for a few sources, mainly due to a lack of high cadence observations at mas resolution. We combine GRAVITY multi-epoch observations of HD98922 at mas resolution with PIONIER archival data covering a total time span of 11 years. We interpret the interferometric visibilities and spectral energy distribution with geometrical models and through radiative transfer techniques. We investigated high-spectral-resolution quantities to obtain information on the properties of the HI BrG-line-emitting region. The observations are best fitted by a model of a crescent-like asymmetric dust feature located at 1 au and accounting for 70% of the NIR emission. The feature has an almost constant magnitude and orbits the central star with a possible sub-Keplerian period of 12 months, although a 9 month period is another, albeit less probable, solution. The radiative transfer models show that the emission originates from a small amount of carbon-rich (25%) silicates, or quantum-heated particles located in a low-density region. Among different possible scenarios, we favor hydrodynamical instabilities in the inner disk that can create a large vortex. The high spectral resolution differential phases in the BrG-line show that the hot-gas component is offset from the star and in some cases is located between the star and the crescent feature. The scale of the emission does not favor magnetospheric accretion as a driving mechanism. The scenario of an asymmetric disk wind or a massive accreting substellar or planetary companion is discussed. With this unique observational data set for HD98922, we reveal morphological variability in the innermost 2 au of its disk region. |

|**Abstract**| We identify a molecular bubble, and study the star formation and its feedback in the S Mon region, using multiple molecular lines, young stellar objects (YSOs), and infrared data. We revisit the distance to S Mon, ~722+/-9 pc, using Gaia Data Release 3 parallaxes of the associated Class II YSOs. The bubble may be mainly driven by a massive binary system (namely 15 Mon), the primary of which is an O7V-type star. An outflow is detected in the shell of the bubble, suggesting ongoing star formation activities in the vicinity of the bubble. The total wind energy of the massive binary star is three orders of magnitude higher than the sum of the observed turbulent energy in the molecular gas and the kinetic energy of the bubble, indicating that stellar winds help to maintain the turbulence in the S Mon region and drive the bubble. We conclude that the stellar winds of massive stars have an impact on their surrounding environment. |

|| <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |

|**Abstract**| In this manuscript, very blue-shifted broad H$\alpha$ with shifted velocity $\sim$2200km/s is reported in the low redshift Type-1.9 AGN SDSS J1052+1036. Blue-shifted broad emission lines may arise due to the presence of a rotating gas disk around central black hole (BH), but may also be a signature of rare phenomena such as gravitational wave recoil of a supermassive BH (rSMBH) or the presence of a binary BH (BBH) system. Here, due to larger shifted velocity of stronger and wider blue-shifted broad H$\alpha$, the BBH system is disfavoured. Meanwhile, if this object contained a rSMBH, intrinsic obscuration with E(B-V)$\le$0.6 should lead to a detectable broad H$\beta$, indicating the rSMBH scenario not preferred. We find that the blue-shifted broad H$\alpha$ can be well explained by emission from an AGN disk, indicating that SDSS J1052+1036 is likely a disk-emitting AGN. In order to determine which scenario, a rSMBH or a disk emitter, is more preferred, a re-observed spectrum in 2025 can provide robust clues, with a disk emitter probably leading to clear variations of peak positions, peak separations and/or peak intensity ratios in broad H$\alpha$, but with a rSMBH scenario probably leading to no variations of peak separations in broad H$\alpha$. |
