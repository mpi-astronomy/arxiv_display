|**Abstract**| We propose a method based on the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) to recover the high-energy waveform of low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs). Based on the method, we successfully obtain the modulation of the phase-folded light curve above 170 keV using the QPO phase reconstructed at lower energies in MAXI J1535-571 with Insight-HXMT observations. A comprehensive simulation study is conducted to demonstrate that such modulation indeed originates from the QPO. Thus the highest energies turn out to significantly exceed the upper limit of ~100 keV for QPOs reported previously using the Fourier method, marking the first opportunity to study QPO properties above 100 keV in this source. Detailed analyses of these high-energy QPO profiles reveal different QPO properties between the 30-100 keV and 100-200 keV energy ranges: the phase lag remains relatively stable, and the amplitude slightly increases below ~100 keV, whereas above this threshold, soft phase lags and a decrease in amplitude are observed. Given the reports of a hard tail detection in broad spectroscopy, we propose that the newly discovered QPO properties above 100 keV are dominated by the hard tail component, possibly stemming from a relativistic jet. Our findings also indicate a strong correlation between the QPOs originating from the jet and corona, supporting the scenario of jet-corona coupling precssion. We emphasize that our proposed HHT-based method can serve as an efficient manner in expanding the high energy band for studying QPOs, thereby enhancing our understanding of their origin. |
