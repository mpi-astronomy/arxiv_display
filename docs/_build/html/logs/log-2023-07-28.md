|**Abstract**| We present a JWST/MRS spectrum of the quasar J1120+0641 at z=7.0848, the first spectroscopic observation of a reionisation-era quasar in the rest-frame infrared ($0.6<\lambda<3.4\mu$m). In the context of the mysterious fast assembly of the first supermassive black holes at z>7, our observations enable for the first time the detection of hot torus dust, the H$\alpha$ emission line, and the Paschen-series broad emission lines in a quasar at z>7. Hot torus dust is clearly detected as an upturn in the continuum emission at $\lambda_{\text{rest}}\simeq1.3\mu$m, leading to a black-body temperature of $T=1413.5^{+5.7}_{-7.4}$K. Compared to similarly-luminous quasars at 0<z<6, the hot dust in J1120+0641 is somewhat elevated in temperature (top 1%). The temperature is more typical among 6<z<6.5 quasars (top 25%), leading us to postulate a weak evolution in the hot dust temperature at z>6 ($2\sigma$ significance). We measure the black hole mass of J1120+0641 based on the H$\alpha$ Balmer line, $M_{\text{BH}}=1.52\pm0.17\cdot 10^9 M_\odot$, which is in good agreement with the previous rest-UV MgII black hole mass measurement. The black hole mass based on the Paschen-series lines is also consistent, indicating no significant extinction in the rest-frame UV measurement. The broad H$\alpha$, Pa-$\alpha$ and Pa-$\beta$ emission lines are consistent with an origin in a common broad-line region (BLR) with density log$N_H/\text{cm}^{-3}\geq 12$, ionisation parameter $-7<$log$U<-4$, and extinction E(B-V)$\lesssim 0.1$mag. These BLR parameters are consistent with similarly-bright quasars at 0<z<4. Overall, we find that both J1120+0641's hot dust torus and hydrogen BLR properties show no significant peculiarity when compared to luminous quasars down to z=0. The quasar accretion structures must have therefore assembled very quickly, as they appear fully "mature" less than 760 million years after the Big Bang. |

|**Abstract**| Recent observational studies have uncovered a small number of very metal-poor stars with cold kinematics in the Galactic disc and bulge. However, their origins remain enigmatic. We select a total of 138 Milky Way (MW) analogs from the TNG50 cosmological simulation based on their $z=0$ properties: disky morphology, stellar mass, and local environment. In order to make more predictive statements for the MW, we further limit the spatial volume coverage of stellar populations in galaxies to that targeted by the upcoming 4MOST high-resolution survey of the Galactic disc and bulge. We find that across all galaxies, $\sim$20 per cent of very metal-poor (${\rm [Fe/H]} < -2$) stars belong to the disk, with some analogs reaching 30 per cent. About 50$\pm$10 per cent of the VMP disc stars are, on average, older than 12.5 Gyr and $\sim$70$\pm$10 per cent come from accreted satellites. A large fraction of the VMP stars belong to the halo ($\sim$70) and have a median age of 12 Gyr. Our results with the TNG50 cosmological simulation confirm earlier findings with simulations of fewer individual galaxies, and suggest that the stellar disc of the Milky Way is very likely to host significant amounts of very- and extremely-metal-poor stars that, although mostly of ex situ origin, can also form in situ, reinforcing the idea of the existence of a primordial Galactic disc. |

|**Abstract**| Characterizing the physical properties of dust grains in a protoplanetary disk is critical to comprehending the planet formation process. Our study presents ALMA high-resolution observations of the young protoplanetary disk around DG Tau at a 1.3 mm dust continuum. The observations, with a spatial resolution of $\approx 0.04''$, or $\approx5$ au, revealed a geometrically thin and smooth disk without substantial substructures, suggesting that the disk retains the initial conditions of the planet formation. To further analyze the distributions of dust surface density, temperature, and grain size, we conducted a multi-band analysis with several dust models, incorporating ALMA archival data of the 0.87 mm and 3.1 mm dust polarization. The results showed that the Toomre $Q$ parameter is $\lesssim2$ at a 20 au radius, assuming a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 0.01. This implies that a higher dust-to-gas mass ratio is necessary to stabilize the disk. The grain sizes depend on the dust models, and for the DSHARP compact dust, they were found to be smaller than $\sim400$ $\mu$m in the inner region ($r\lesssim20$ au), while exceeding larger than 3 mm in the outer part. Radiative transfer calculations show that the dust scale height is lower than at least one-third of the gas scale height. These distributions of dust enrichment, grain sizes, and weak turbulence strength may have significant implications for the formation of planetesimals through mechanisms such as streaming instability. We also discuss the CO snowline effect and collisional fragmentation in dust coagulation for the origin of the dust size distribution. |
