|**Abstract**| Investigating Protostellar Accretion (IPA) is a Cycle 1 JWST program using the NIRSpec+MIRI IFUs to obtain 2.9--28 $\mu$m spectral cubes of five young protostars with luminosities of 0.2 to 10,000 L$_{\odot}$ in their primary accretion phase. This paper introduces the NIRSpec 2.9--5.3 $\mu$m data of the inner 840-9000 au with spatial resolutions from 28-300 au. The spectra show rising continuum emission, deep ice absorption, emission from H$_{2}$, H~I, and [Fe~II], and the CO fundamental series in emission and absorption. Maps of the continuum emission show scattered light cavities for all five protostars. In the cavities, collimated jets are detected in [Fe~II] for the four $< 320$~L$_{\odot}$ protostars, two of which are additionally traced in Br-$\alpha$. Knots of [Fe~II] emission are detected toward the most luminous protostar, and knots of [FeII] emission with dynamical times of $< 30$~yrs are found in the jets of the others. While only one jet is traced in H$_2$, knots of H$_2$ and CO are detected in the jets of four protostars. H$_2$ is seen extending through the cavities showing they are filled by warm molecular gas. Bright H$_2$ emission is seen along the walls of a single cavity, while in three cavities, narrow shells of H$_2$ emission are found, one of which has an [Fe~II] knot at its apex. These data show cavities containing collimated jets traced in atomic/ionic gas surrounded by warm molecular gas in a wide-angle wind and/or gas accelerated by bow shocks in the jets. |

|**Abstract**| We report the first statistical analyses of [CII] and dust continuum observations in six strong OI absorber fields at the end of the reionization epoch obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). Combined with one [CII] emitter reported in Wu et al. (2021), we detect one OI-associated [CII] emitter in six fields. At redshifts of OI-absorbers in non-detection fields, no emitters are brighter than our detection limit within impact parameters of 50 kpc and velocity offsets between $\pm200\ {\rm km\ s^{-1}}$. The averaged [CII]-detection upper limit is $< 0.06$ Jy ${\rm km\ s^{-1}}$ (3$\sigma$), corresponding to the [CII] luminosity of $L_{\rm [CII]} <5.8\times 10^7\ L_{\odot}$ and the [CII]-based star formation rate of ${\rm SFR_{\rm [CII]}} < 5.5$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Cosmological simulations suggest that only $\sim10^{-2.5}$ [CII] emitters around [OI] absorbers have comparable SFR to our detection limit. Although the detection in one out of six fields is reported, an order of magnitude number excess of emitters obtained from our ALMA observations supports that the contribution of massive galaxies that caused the metal enrichment cannot be ignored. Further, we also found 14 tentative galaxy candidates with S/N of $\approx4.3$ at large impact parameters ($>50$ kpc) and having larger outflow velocities within $\pm 600$ km s$^{-1}$. If these detections are confirmed in the future, then the mechanism of pushing metals at larger distances with higher velocities needs to be further explored from the theoretical side. |

|**Abstract**| Double white dwarf systems are of great astrophysical importance in the field of gravitational wave and Type Ia supernova. While the binary fraction of CO core white dwarf is about a few percents, the extremely low mass white dwarfs are all thought to be within binary systems. In this work, we report the orbital solution of a double degenerate system: J033847.06+413424.24, an extremely low mass He core white dwarf orbiting a CO core white dwarf. With LAMOST and P200, time domain spectroscopic observations have been made and spectral atmosphere parameters are estimated to be $T_{\rm eff}\sim22500$ K and log $g\sim5.6$ dex. Combining Gaia parallax, 3D extinction, and evolution tracks, we estimate a radius of $\sim0.12$ $R_{\odot}$ and a mass of $\sim0.22$ $M_{\odot}$. With the 37 single exposure spectra, the radial velocities are measured and the orbital parameters are estimated to be $P=0.1253132(1)$ days, $K1=289\pm4$ km/s and $V_{sys}=-41\pm3$ km/s. The radial velocity based system ephemeris is also provided. The light curves from several photometric surveys show no orbital modulation. The orbital solution suggests that the invisible companion has a minimum mass of about 0.60 $M_{\odot}$ and is $\sim0.79$ $M_{\odot}$ for an inclination of $60.0^{\circ}$, indicating most probably a CO core white dwarf. The system is expected to merge in about 1 Gyr. With present period and distance ($\sim596$ pc) it can not irradiate strong enough gravitational wave for LISA. More double degenerate systems are expected to be discovered and parameterized as the LAMOST survey goes on. |

|**Abstract**| In the framework of the IMEGIN Large Program, we used the NIKA2 camera on the IRAM 30-m telescope to observe the edge-on galaxy NGC 891 at 1.15 mm and 2 mm and at a FWHM of 11.1" and 17.6", respectively. Multiwavelength data enriched with the new NIKA2 observations fitted by the HerBIE SED code (coupled with the THEMIS dust model) were used to constrain the physical properties of the ISM. Emission originating from the diffuse dust disk is detected at all wavelengths from mid-IR to mm, while mid-IR observations reveal warm dust emission from compact HII regions. Indications of mm excess emission have also been found in the outer parts of the galactic disk. Furthermore, our SED fitting analysis constrained the mass fraction of the small (< 15 Angstrom) dust grains. We found that small grains constitute 9.5% of the total dust mass in the galactic plane, but this fraction increases up to ~ 20% at large distances (|z| > 3 kpc) from the galactic plane. |
