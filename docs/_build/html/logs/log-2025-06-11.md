|**Abstract**|            In this paper we present the current status of the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission, which has been fully approved for launch in 2030. eXTP is a space science mission designed to study fundamental physics under extreme conditions of matter density, gravity, and magnetism. The mission aims at determining the equation of state of matter at supra-nuclear density, measuring effects of QED, and understanding the dynamics of matter in strong-field gravity. In addition to investigating fundamental physics, the eXTP mission is poised to become a leading observatory for time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy in the 2030s, as well as providing observations of unprecedented quality on a variety of galactic and extragalactic objects. After briefly introducing the history and a summary of the scientific objectives of the eXTP mission, this paper presents a comprehensive overview of: 1) the cutting-edge technology, technical specifications, and anticipated performance of the mission's scientific instruments; 2) the full mission profile, encompassing spacecraft design, operational capabilities, and ground segment infrastructure.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the novel capabilities of the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry (eXTP) mission to study the strong gravity region around stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems and supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei. eXTP can combine X-ray spectral, timing, and polarimetric techniques to study the accretion process near black holes, measure black hole masses and spins, and test Einstein's theory of General Relativity in the strong field regime. We show how eXTP can improve the current measurements of black holes of existing X-ray missions and we discuss the scientific questions that can be addressed.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a study of the double-lined spectroscopic binary HD 21278 that contains one of the brightest main sequence stars in the young $\alpha$ Persei open cluster. We analyzed new spectra and reanalyzed archived spectra to measure precise new radial velocity curves for the binary. We also obtained interferometric data using the CHARA Array at Mount Wilson to measure the sky positions of the two stars and the inclination of the $\sim$ 2 milliarcsecond orbit. We determine that the two stars have masses of $5.381 \pm 0.084 M_{\odot}$ and $3.353 \pm 0.064 M_{\odot}$. From isochrone fits, we find the cluster's age to be $49 \pm 7$ Myr (using PARSEC models) or $49.5 \pm 6$ Myr (MIST models). Finally, we revisit the massive white dwarfs that are candidate escapees from the $\alpha$ Persei cluster to try to better characterize the massive end of the white dwarf initial-final mass relation. The implied progenitor masses challenge the idea that Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs are made by single stars with masses near $8 \msun$.         |

|**Abstract**|            Scheduled for launch in 2030, the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarization (eXTP) telescope is a Chinese space-based mission aimed at studying extreme conditions and phenomena in astrophysics. eXTP will feature three main payloads: Spectroscopy Focusing Arrays (SFAs), Polarimetry Focusing Arrays (PFAs), and a Wide-field Camera (W2C). This white paper outlines observatory science, incorporating key scientific advances and instrumental changes since the publication of the previous white paper [1]. We will discuss perspectives of eXTP on the research domains of flare stars, supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, cataclysmic variables, X-ray binaries, ultraluminous X-ray sources, AGN, and pulsar-based positioning and timekeeping.         |

|**Abstract**|            In this paper we present the science potential of the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry (eXTP) mission, in its new configuration, for studies of strongly magnetized compact objects. We discuss the scientific potential of eXTP for QED studies, especially leveraging on the recent observations made with the NASA IXPE mission. Given eXTP's unique combination of timing, spectroscopy, and polarimetry, we focus on the perspectives for physics and astrophysics studies of strongly magnetized compact objects, such as magnetars and accreting X-ray pulsars. Developed by an international Consortium led by the Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the eXTP mission is expected to launch in early 2030.         |

|**Abstract**|            ESA's Euclid cosmology mission relies on the very sensitive and accurately calibrated spectroscopy channel of the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP). With three operational grisms in two wavelength intervals, NISP provides diffraction-limited slitless spectroscopy over a field of $0.57$ deg$^2$. A blue grism $\text{BG}_\text{E}$ covers the wavelength range $926$--$1366$\,nm at a spectral resolution $R=440$--$900$ for a $0.5''$ diameter source with a dispersion of $1.24$ nm px$^{-1}$. Two red grisms $\text{RG}_\text{E}$ span $1206$ to $1892$\,nm at $R=550$--$740$ and a dispersion of $1.37$ nm px$^{-1}$. We describe the construction of the grisms as well as the ground testing of the flight model of the NISP instrument where these properties were established.         |

|| Z. Chen, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-06-11*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal*|
|**Abstract**|            We conducted a comprehensive analysis of young stellar object (YSO) variability at submillimeter and mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelengths for the M\,17 \ion{H}{2} region, using 3.5 years monitoring data from the JCMT Transient Survey at $450$ and $850\,\mu$m and 9 years mid-IR monitoring data from the NEOWISE mission. Our study encompasses observations of 198 and 164 bright submillimeter peaks identified within the deep JCMT coadded maps at 450 and $850\,\mu$m, and 66 YSOs seen by NEOWISE W2 that were previously identified in mid-IR observations. We find one robust linear submillimeter variable, an intermediate mass protostar, with a $4\%$ peak flux change in 3.5 years of JCMT monitoring that sets a lower limit of $16\%$ luminosity increase for the source. At mid-IR wavelengths, our analysis reveals secular and stochastic variability in 22 YSOs, with the highest fraction of secular variability occurring at the earliest evolutionary stage. This mid-IR fractional variability as a function of evolutionary stage result is similar to what has previously been found for YSO variability within the Gould Belt and the intermediate-mass star formation region M17\,SWex, though overall less variability is detected in M\,17 in submillimeter and mid-IR. We suspect that this lower detection of YSO variability is due to both the greater distance to M\,17 and the strong feedback from the \ion{H}{2} region. Our findings showcase the utility of multiwavelength observations to better capture the complex variability phenomena inherent to star formation processes and demonstrate the importance of years-long monitoring of a diverse selection of star-forming environments.         |

|| <mark>X. Zhang</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-06-11*|
|*Comments*| *10 pages, 5 figures, Accepted in ApJL*|
|**Abstract**|            Coronal waves, significant solar phenomena, act as diagnostic tools for scientists studying solar atmosphere properties. Here, we present a novel observation detailing how a coronal wave event, associated with an X5.0 class flare, influenced the properties of an adjacent coronal hole through interaction. The coronal wave was observed in both extreme ultraviolet observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory and Lyman-alpha observations from the Solar Disk Imager aboard the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory. Utilizing the method of differential emission measure, we found that as the coronal wave passed through, the adjacent coronal hole experienced an increase in temperature from 1.31 to 1.43 MK and a rise in density from $\sim$1.62$\times10^{8}$ to 1.76$\times10^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$ within the rising period of $\sim$7 minutes. Subsequently, after the wave passed, the entire coronal hole transitioned to a new state with a slight temperature increase and a 14$\%$ decrease in density, with more pronounced changes observed at the coronal hole's boundary. Taking into account the impacts of radiative loss and heat conduction, the coronal wave was estimated to provide an average energy of 2.2$\times10^{8}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ to the coronal hole during the short rising period. This study highlights the identification of the coronal wave in both extreme ultraviolet and Lyman-alpha observations, shedding light on the significant energy input, particularly within the coronal hole. These findings provide new insights into better understanding kinematics of fast coronal waves, energy transfer processes open versus closed magnetic topologies, and the possible acceleration of solar winds.         |
