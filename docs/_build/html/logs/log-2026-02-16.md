|**Abstract**|            We present a panchromatic optical-mm characterization of GNz7q, a recently identified X-ray weak, rapidly growing red quasar embedded within a dusty starburst galaxy at $z=7.1899$, using the full suite of JWST/NIRCam, NIRSpec, MIRI, and archival NOEMA observations. Our deep NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy reveals unambiguous broad Balmer emission (FWHM $=2221\pm20$kms$^{-1}$), confirming a super-Eddington accreting black hole ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}=2.7\pm0.4$) with a mass of $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot})=7.55\pm0.34$, using accretion-rate corrected BH mass estimators. After subtracting the point source, we robustly detect stellar emission from the host galaxy across multiple NIRCam and MIRI filters. Out joint morphological-spectral analysis yields a stellar mass of $\log (M_*/M_\odot)=10.5\pm0.4$ and an intense star formation rate of ${\rm SFR}=330\pm97\,M_\odot\,\rm yr^{-1}$, confirming the host as a massive, dusty starburst galaxy. We find that GNz7q lies on the local $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation ($M_{\rm BH}/M_*\simeq 0.001$) and is well positioned to evolve into the locus of massive SDSS quasars with $\log (M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)\approx 9$ and $M_*\approx 10^{11}\,M_\odot$ at $z\sim 6$, owing to its remarkably rapid growth in both the black hole and its host galaxy. This stands in stark contrast to many recently reported JWST AGN populations at similar redshifts, including the little red dots (LRDs), whose weak or undetected star formation makes it difficult for them to grow into the massive galaxies hosting SDSS-like quasars. These results suggest that GNz7q marks as a rare, pivotal phase of early BH-galaxy co-eolution, plausibly providing a crucial direct pathway to the supermassive black hole systems within the first billion years of the Universe.         |

|**Abstract**|            Despite observational progress in planet formation, the stage in which planetesimals grow into planets remains poorly understood. During this phase, protoplanets may develop gaseous envelopes that are warmer than the surrounding disk gas, potentially providing observable signatures through molecules otherwise depleted in cold regions. In this Letter, we report the detection of the silicon sulfide isotopologues ${\rm ^{28}SiS}\ J{=}16{-}15$ and ${\rm ^{30}SiS}\ J{=}18{-}17$ in the protoplanetary disk around PDS 66 (MP Mus) at a significance of ${\sim}5{-}6\sigma$, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. These constitute the second and first detections of $\rm ^{28}SiS$ and $\rm ^{30}SiS$ in a protoplanetary disk, respectively. The emission appears as a compact source at $r \simeq 60$ au in the southwestern region of the disk, unresolved with a ${\sim}0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}5$ beam, and shows a velocity consistent with Keplerian rotation, suggesting a protoplanetary origin. By modeling the line fluxes, we constrain the emitting radius to ${\sim}0.5{-}4$ au and estimate an SiS mass of $10^{22}{-}10^{23}$ g, corresponding to at least ${\sim}10\%$ of the silicon contained in local dust grains. Because complete sublimation of a substantial fraction of dust grains by local processes is difficult to achieve, this result instead implies an accumulation of silicon from a larger region. We propose that a circumplanetary envelope surrounding a low-mass protoplanet, where pebble accretion and subsequent sublimation of grains may enhance gaseus silicon abundance with respect to observable dust grains around it, can account for the observed characteristics.         |

|**Abstract**|            Context. Warm Jupiters are excellent case studies for the investigation of giant planet internal structures and formation theories. However, the sample of long-period transiting giants is still small today for a better understanding of this population. Aims. Starting from a single transit found in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data, we confirm the planetary nature of the signal and measure its orbital parameters, mass, and radius. We put this system in the context of long-period giant transiting planets and analyzed the viability to sustain atmospheric or dynamical follow-up. Methods. We carried out a spectroscopic follow-up using FEROS and PLATOSpec to obtain precise radial velocities. We added a photometric follow-up with HATPI and Observatoire Moana to obtain a more precise estimate of the orbital period. We derived the orbital and physical parameters through a joint analysis of this data. Results. We report the discovery and characterization of TIC65910228b, a transiting warm Jupiter with a mass of $4.554 \pm 0.255$ $M_J$ and a radius of $1.088 \pm 0.061$ $R_J$, orbiting an evolved F-type star every $\sim 180.52$ days in an eccentric orbit ($e = 0.25 \pm 0.04$). Conclusions. This planet joins a still under-explored population of long-period ($P > 100$) massive ($M_p > 4$ $M_J$) transiting giant planets, being one of the few with a mild eccentricity. This target is a nice example of the potential of single-transit events to populate this region of the parameter space.         |

|| <mark>Y. Wang</mark>, S. Heinz |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-02-16*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            The physical nature and origins of the newly discovered class of Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) remain unclear. We investigate a model whereby ORCs are synchrotron-emitting vortex rings formed by the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) when a shock interacts with a low-density fossil radio lobe in the intergalactic medium using 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. These rings initially exhibit oscillatory behavior that damps over time. We implement a new method to model Inverse-Compton cooling and synchrotron cooling at high frequencies in a scale-free manner, enabling us to test a wide range of model parameters against the observational constraints. We find that shock strengths of Mach 2-4 are consistent with the data, as expected in accretion, merger-driven, or active galactic nuclei-driven shocks. We find that the initial size of the bubbles required to explain the rings ranges from 140 to 250 kpc, with initial energy in the bubble of order $10^{57}-10^{59}$ erg, consistent with fossil lobes inflated by moderately powerful radio galaxies. Derived ambient pressures and densities place ORCs in low density environments, such as the outskirts of galaxy groups with ages of order 70-200 Myr. Our synthetic radio maps match the polarization properties of ORC1 and predict a dependency of the tangential magnetic field angle on the aspect ratio of ORCs. A key distinguishing trait of the RMI-driven vortex ring model is that it does not require the ORC to be centered on its host galaxy and is therefore redshift agnostic.         |

|| L. Staveley-Smith, et al. -- incl., <mark>N. Wang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-02-16*|
|*Comments*| *20 pages, 18 figures, accepted by PASA (11 February 2026), abbreviated abstract*|
|**Abstract**|            Spectral-line results from a new cryogenic phased array feed (cryoPAF) on the Murriyang telescope at Parkes are presented. This array offers a significant improvement in field of view, aperture efficiency, bandwidth, chromaticity and survey speed compared with conventional horn-fed receivers. We demonstrate this with measurements of sky calibrators and observations of 21-cm neutral hydrogen (HI) in the LMC and the nearby galaxy NGC 6744. Within 0.3 deg of the optical axis, the ratio of system temperature to dish aperture efficiency is 25 K and the ratio with beam efficiency is 21 K (at 1.4 GHz). For the previously measured $T_{sys} = 17$ K, respective efficiency values 0.7 and 0.8 are derived. Our HI observational results are in good agreement with previous results, although detailed comparison with multibeam observations of the LMC suggests that the earlier observations may have missed an extended component of low-column-density gas ($8\times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$). We use the cryoPAF zoom-band and wideband data to make a preliminary investigation of whether the large number of simultaneous beams (72) permits the use of novel data reduction methods to reduce the effects of foreground/background continuum contamination and RFI. We also investigate if these methods can better protect against signal loss for the detection of faint, extended cosmological signals such as HI intensity maps. Using robust higher-order singular value decomposition (SVD) techniques, we find encouraging results for the detection of both compact and extended sources, including challenging conditions with high RFI occupancy and significant sky continuum structure. Examples are shown that demonstrate that 3D SVD techniques offer a significant improvement in noise reduction and signal capture compared with more traditional layered 2D techniques.         |

|| K. Z. Arellano-Córdova, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. Kreckel</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-02-16*|

|**Abstract**|            The unprecedented rest-frame UV and optical coverage provided by JWST enables simultaneous constraints on the electron density (n$_{\rm e}$) and temperature (T$_{\rm e}$) of ionized gas in galaxies at z>5. We present a self-consistent direct method based on multiple OIII]1661,66) and [OIII] ($\lambda$4363, and $\lambda$5007) transitions to characterize the physical conditions of the high-ionization zone. This new approach is insensitive to a wide range of n$_{\rm e}$ due to the high critical densities of the OIII] and [OIII] transitions. Applying this technique to six galaxies at z=5-9, we find electron densities up to n$_{\rm e}$$\sim 3\times 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures of T$_{\rm e}$ $\sim 20,000$ K in systems at $z>6$. Accounting for these self-consistent densities changes the derived T$_{\rm e}$ and modifies the inferred metallicities by up to 0.29 dex relative to previous estimates. We discuss the reported N/O overabundances in the high-$z$ galaxies from our sample, which arise entirely from the high N$^{3+}$/H$^{+}$ values inferred from NIV] lines. We point out that a T$_{\rm e}$-stratification, in which the N$^{3+}$ zone has a slightly higher T$_{\rm e}$ than T$_{\rm e}$([OIII]), could substantially reduce the inferred N/O. Quantitatively, if T$_{\rm e}$(N$^{3+}$) were 10\% higher than T$_{\rm e}$([OIII]), this could induce a systematic overestimation of N$^{3+}$/O$^{2+}$ of nearly 50\%. Classical N/O diagnostics such as N$^{+}$/O$^{+}$, due to their critical densities, can significantly impact the inferred N/O abundance in the presence of high-density gas, whereas N$^{2+}$/O$^{2+}$ place these galaxies closer to $z\sim0$ systems in the N/O-O/H plane. Future JWST programs with larger and more diverse samples will be essential to test the universality and robustness of these results.         |
