|**Abstract**| We present new neutral hydrogen (HI) observations of the nearby galaxy NGC 2403 to determine the nature of a low-column density cloud that was detected earlier by the Green Bank Telescope. We find that this cloud is the tip of a complex of filaments of extraplanar gas that is coincident with the thin disk. The total HI mass of the complex is $2\times10^{7}\text{ M}_\odot$ or 0.6% of the total HI mass of the galaxy. The main structure, previously referred to as the 8-kpc filament, is now seen to be even more extended, along a 20 kpc stream. The kinematics and morphological properties of the filaments are unlikely to be the result of outflows related to galactic fountains. It is more likely that the 20 kpc filament is related to a recent galaxy interaction. In this context, a $\sim$ 50 kpc long stellar stream has been recently detected connecting NGC 2403 with the nearby dwarf satellite DDO 44. Intriguingly, the southern tip of this stream overlaps with that of 20 kpc HI filament. We conclude that the HII anomalies in NGC 2403 are the result of a recent ($\sim2\text{ Gyr}$) interaction with DDO 44 leading to the observed filamentary complex. |

|**Abstract**| The Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) is one of the four focal plane instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope. In this paper, we summarize the in-orbit performance of NIRSpec, as derived from data collected during its commissioning campaign and the first few months of nominal science operations. More specifically, we discuss the performance of some critical hardware components such as the two NIRSpec Hawaii-2RG (H2RG) detectors, wheel mechanisms, and the micro-shutter array. We also summarize the accuracy of the two target acquisition procedures used to accurately place science targets into the slit apertures, discuss the current status of the spectro-photometric and wavelength calibration of NIRSpec spectra, and provide the as measured sensitivity in all NIRSpec science modes. Finally, we point out a few important considerations for the preparation of NIRSpec science programs. |

|**Abstract**| Five stars in the extreme outskirts (from $\sim5$ to $\sim12$ elliptical half-light radii, r$_h$) of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf galaxy have been identified as potential new members using a Bayesian algorithm applied to \textit{Gaia} EDR3 data. These targets were observed with the GRACES spectrograph, resulting in precise radial velocities and metallicities that confirm their association with UMi. For the brightest and outermost star (Target~1, at $\sim12$ r$_h$), the chemical abundances of $\alpha$- (Mg, Ca, Ti), odd-Z (Na, K, Sc), Fe-peak (Fe, Ni, Cr), and neutron-capture process (Ba) elements have also been determined. We also discuss data from the literature and from APOGEE DR17. We find the chemical patterns in UMi are consistent with a star formation history that includes yields from core collapse supernovae, asymptotic giant branch stars, and supernovae Ia. Evidence for a knee in the [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios near [Fe/H] $\sim-2.1$ indicates a low star formation efficiency similar to that in other dwarf galaxies. Given the distance of Target~1 from the centre of UMi (R$\sim$4.5 kpc), we show that UMi has a more extended structure than previously thought. This "stellar halo" around UMi could be a secondary feature resulting from tidal stripping after multiple orbits around the Galaxy, or maybe a primary UMi feature due to early hierarchical accretion activity or to strong gravitational fluctuations prompted by feedback in the early star formation phase. Also consistent with observations is a late-time merger-free scenario where outside-in star formation is accompanied by gradual supernovae Ia enrichment. |

|**Abstract**| During the commissioning of {\em JWST}, the Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) on the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) observed the planetary nebula SMP LMC 058 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The MRS was designed to provide medium resolution (R = $\lambda$/$\Delta\lambda$) 3D spectroscopy in the whole MIRI range. SMP LMC 058 is the only source observed in {\em JWST} commissioning that is both spatially and spectrally unresolved by the MRS and is a good test of {\em JWST's} capabilities. The new MRS spectra reveal a wealth of emission lines not previously detected in this metal-poor planetary nebula. From these lines, the spectral resolving power ($\lambda$/$\Delta\lambda$) of the MRS is confirmed to be in the range R $=$ 4000 to 1500, depending on the MRS spectral sub-band. In addition, the spectra confirm that the carbon-rich dust emission is from SiC grains and that there is little to no time evolution of the SiC dust and emission line strengths over a 16-year epoch. These commissioning data reveal the great potential of the MIRI MRS. |

|**Abstract**| The last decade has seen tremendous developments in gamma-ray astronomy with the extragalactic sky becoming highly populated by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This brief review highlights some of the progress in AGN research achieved over the years, and discusses exemplary advances in the theory and physics of gamma-ray loud AGNs, including black-hole magnetospheric processes, the physics of pc-scales jets, as well as particle acceleration and high-energy emission in the large-scale jets of AGNs. |

|**Abstract**| Stars strongly impact their environment, and shape structures on all scales throughout the universe, in a process known as ``feedback''. Due to the complexity of both stellar evolution and the physics of larger astrophysical structures, there remain many unanswered questions about how feedback operates, and what we can learn about stars by studying their imprint on the wider universe. In this white paper, we summarize discussions from the Lorentz Center meeting `Bringing Stellar Evolution and Feedback Together' in April 2022, and identify key areas where further dialogue can bring about radical changes in how we view the relationship between stars and the universe they live in. |

|**Abstract**| The role of magnetic fields in galaxy evolution is still an unsolved question in astrophysics. We have previously shown that magnetic fields play a crucial role in major mergers between disc galaxies; in hydrodynamic simulations of such mergers, the Auriga model produces compact remnants with a distinctive bar and ring morphology. In contrast, in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, remnants form radially-extended discs with prominent spiral arm structure. In this paper, we analyse a series of cosmological "zoom-in" simulations of major mergers and identify exactly $\textit{how}$ magnetic fields are able to alter the outcome of the merger. We find that magnetic fields modify the transport of angular momentum, systematically hastening the merger progress. The impact of this altered transport depends on the orientation of the field, with a predominantly azimuthal (non-azimuthal) orientation providing support against collapse (increasing the central baryonic concentration). Both effects act to suppress an otherwise existent bar-instability, which in turn leads to a fundamentally different morphology and manifestation of feedback. We note, in particular, that stellar feedback is substantially less influential in MHD simulations, which allows for the later accretion of higher angular momentum gas and the subsequent rapid radial growth of the remnant disc. A corollary of the increased baryonic concentration in MHD simulations is that black holes are able to grow twice as large, although this turns out to have little impact on the remnant's development. Our results show that galaxy evolution cannot be modelled correctly without including magnetic fields. |

|**Abstract**| Black hole evaporation is generally considered inevitable for low-mass black holes, yet there is no confirmation of this remarkable hypothesis. Here, we propose a phenomenological model that appeals to the possible survival of light quasi-extremal primordial black holes as a significant dark matter component and show that the related cosmological and astrophysical constraints disappear for reasonable degrees of quasi-extremality. The results obtained are general, conservative and should be taken as a proof of principle for future, model-specific analyses. |

|**Abstract**| We employ the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) physics model to study how the properties of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) evolve during galaxy mergers. We conduct a pixel-by-pixel analysis of molecular gas properties in both the simulated control galaxies and galaxy major mergers. The simulated GMC-pixels in the control galaxies follow a similar trend in a diagram of velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$) versus gas surface density ($\Sigma_{\mathrm{mol}}$) to the one observed in local spiral galaxies in the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) survey. For GMC-pixels in simulated mergers, we see a significant increase of factor of 5 - 10 in both $\Sigma_{\mathrm{mol}}$ and $\sigma_v$, which puts these pixels above the trend of PHANGS galaxies in the $\sigma_v$ vs $\Sigma_{\mathrm{mol}}$ diagram. This deviation may indicate that GMCs in the simulated mergers are much less gravitationally bound compared with simulated control galaxies with virial parameter ($\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$) reaching 10 - 100. Furthermore, we find that the increase in $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ happens at the same time as the increase in global star formation rate (SFR), which suggests stellar feedback is responsible for dispersing the gas. We also find that the gas depletion time is significantly lower for high $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ GMCs during a starburst event. This is in contrast to the simple physical picture that low $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ GMCs are easier to collapse and form stars on shorter depletion times. This might suggest that some other physical mechanisms besides self-gravity are helping the GMCs in starbursting mergers collapse and form stars. |

|**Abstract**| The phenomenon of pulsar nulling, observed as the temporary inactivity of a pulsar, remains poorly understood both observationally and theoretically. Most observational studies that quantify nulling employ a variant of Ritchings (1976)'s algorithm which can suffer significant biases for pulsars where the emission is weak. Using a more robust mixture model method, we study pulsar nulling in a sample of 22 recently discovered pulsars, for which we publish the nulling fractions for the first time. These data clearly demonstrate biases of the former approach and show how an otherwise non-nulling pulsar can be classified as having significant nulls. We show that the population-wide studies that find a positive correlation of nulling with pulsar period/characteristic age can similarly be biased because of the bias in estimating the nulling fraction. We use our probabilistic approach to find the evidence for periodicity in the nulls in a subset of three pulsars in our sample. In addition, we also provide improved timing parameters for 17 of the 22 pulsars that had no prior follow-up. |

|| Juan Garrido-Deutelmoser, et al. -- incl., <mark>Ke Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-02-01*|
|*Comments*| *11 pages, 8 figures, re-submitted to ApJL, comments welcome*|
|**Abstract**| ALMA observations of the disk around HD 163296 have resolved a crescent-shape substructure at around 55 au, inside and off-center from a gap in the dust that extends from 38 au to 62 au. In this work we propose that both the crescent and the dust rings are caused by a compact pair (period ratio $\simeq 4:3$) of sub-Saturn-mass planets inside the gap, with the crescent corresponding to dust trapped at the $L_5$ Lagrange point of the outer planet. This interpretation also reproduces well the gap in the gas recently measured from the CO observations, which is shallower than what is expected in a model where the gap is carved by a single planet. Building on previous works arguing for outer planets at $\approx 86$ and $\approx 137$ au, we provide with a global model of the disk that best reproduces the data and show that all four planets may fall into a long resonant chain, with the outer three planets in a 1:2:4 Laplace resonance. We show that this configuration is not only an expected outcome from disk-planet interaction in this system, but it can also help constraining the radial and angular position of the planet candidates using three-body resonances. |

|**Abstract**| We present a high time resolution, multi-frequency linear polarization analysis of Very Large Array (VLA) radio observations during some of the brightest radio flaring (~1 Jy) activity of the 2015 outburst of V404 Cygni. The VLA simultaneously captured the radio evolution in two bands (each with two 1 GHz base-bands), recorded at 5/7 GHz and 21/26 GHz, allowing for a broadband polarimetric analysis. Given the source's high flux densities, we were able to measure polarization on timescales of ~13 minutes, constituting one of the highest temporal resolution radio polarimetric studies of a black hole X-ray binary (BHXB) outburst to date. Across all base-bands, we detect variable, weakly linearly polarized emission (<1%) with a single, bright peak in the time-resolved polarization fraction, consistent with an origin in an evolving, dynamic jet component. We applied two independent polarimetric methods to extract the intrinsic electric vector position angles and rotation measures from the 5 and 7 GHz base-band data and detected a variable intrinsic polarization angle, indicative of a rapidly evolving local environment or a complex magnetic field geometry. Comparisons to the simultaneous, spatially-resolved observations taken with the Very Long Baseline Array at 15.6 GHz, do not show a significant connection between the jet ejections and the polarization state. |

|*Comments*| *Submitted to ApJ, 16 pages, 9 figures, 1 table*|
|**Abstract**| The initial mass function (IMF) of planetesimals is of key importance for understanding the initial stages of planet formation, yet theoretical predictions so far have been insufficient in explaining the variety of IMFs found in simulations. Here, we connect diffusion-tidal-shear limited planetesimal formation within the framework of a Toomre-like instability in the particle mid-plane of a protoplanetary disk to an analytic prediction for the planetesimal IMF. The shape of the IMF is set by the stability parameter $Q_\mathrm{p}$, which in turn depends on the particle Stokes number, the Toomre $Q$ value of the gas, the local dust concentration and the local diffusivity. We compare our prediction to high-resolution numerical simulations of the streaming instability and planetesimal formation via gravitational collapse. We find that our IMF prediction agrees with numerical results, and is consistent with both the `planetesimals are born big' paradigm and the power law description commonly found in simulations. |

|**Abstract**| Blazar emission is dominated by nonthermal radiation processes that are highly variable across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Turbulence, which can be a major source of nonthermal particle acceleration, can widely exist in the blazar emission region. The Turbulent Extreme Multi-Zone (TEMZ) model has been widely used to describe turbulent radiation signatures. Recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have also revealed the stochastic nature of the turbulent emission region and particle acceleration therein. However, radiation signatures have not been systematically studied via first-principle-integrated simulations. In this paper, we perform combined PIC and polarized radiative transfer simulations to study synchrotron emission from magnetic turbulence in the blazar emission region. We find that the multi-wavelength flux and polarization are generally characterized by stochastic patterns. Specifically, the variability time scale and average polarization degree (PD) are governed by the correlation length of the turbulence. Interestingly, magnetic turbulence can result in polarization angle (PA) swings with arbitrary amplitudes and duration, in either directions, that are not associated to changes in flux or PD. Surprisingly, these swings, which are of stochastic nature, can appear either bumpy or smooth, although large amplitude swings ($>180^{\circ}$) are very rare as expected. Our radiation and polarization signatures from first-principle-integrated simulations are consistent with the TEMZ model. |

|**Abstract**| The shear measurement from DECaLS (Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey) provides an excellent opportunity for galaxy-galaxy lensing study with DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) galaxies, given the large ($\sim 9000$ deg$^2$) sky overlap. We explore this potential by combining the DESI 1\% survey and DECaLS DR8. With $\sim 106$ deg$^2$ sky overlap, we achieve significant detection of galaxy-galaxy lensing for BGS and LRG as lenses. Scaled to the full BGS sample, we expect the statistical errors to improve from $18(12)\%$ to a promising level of $2(1.3)\%$ at $\theta>8^{'}(<8^{'})$. This brings stronger requirements for future systematics control. To fully realize such potential, we need to control the residual multiplicative shear bias $|m|<0.01$ and the bias in the mean redshift $|\Delta z|<0.015$. We also expect significant detection of galaxy-galaxy lensing with DESI LRG/ELG full samples as lenses, and cosmic magnification of ELG through cross-correlation with low-redshift DECaLS shear. {If such systematical error control can be achieved,} we find the advantages of DECaLS, comparing with KiDS (Kilo Degree Survey) and HSC (Hyper-Suprime Cam), are at low redshift, large-scale, and in measuring the shear-ratio (to $\sigma_R\sim 0.04$) and cosmic magnification. |

|**Abstract**| Galaxy shear - cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing convergence cross-correlations contain additional information on cosmology to auto-correlations. While being immune to certain systematic effects, they are affected by the galaxy intrinsic alignments (IA). This may be responsible for the reported low lensing amplitude of the galaxy shear $\times$ CMB convergence cross-correlations, compared to the standard Planck $\Lambda$CDM (cosmological constant and cold dark matter) cosmology prediction. In this work, we investigate how IA affects the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) galaxy lensing shear - Planck CMB lensing convergence cross-correlation and compare it to previous treatments with or without IA taken into consideration. More specifically, we compare marginalization over IA parameters and the IA self-calibration (SC) method (with additional observables defined only from the source galaxies) and prove that SC can efficiently break the degeneracy between the CMB lensing amplitude $A_{\rm lens}$ and the IA amplitude $A_{\rm IA}$. We further investigate how different systematics affect the resulting $A_{\rm IA}$ and $A_{\rm lens}$, and validate our results with the MICE2 simulation. We find that by including the SC method to constrain IA, the information loss due to the degeneracy between CMB lensing and IA is strongly reduced. The best-fit values are $A_{\rm lens}=0.84^{+0.22}_{-0.22}$ and $A_{\rm IA}=0.60^{+1.03}_{-1.03}$, while different angular scale cuts can affect $A_{\rm lens}$ by $\sim10\%$. We show that appropriate treatment of the boost factor, cosmic magnification, and photometric redshift modeling is important for obtaining the correct IA and cosmological results. |

|**Abstract**| AR Scorpii (AR Sco), the only-known radio-pulsing white dwarf binary, shows unusual pulsating emission at the radio, infrared, optical and ultraviolet bands. To determine its astrometric parameters at the radio band independently, we conducted multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) phase-referencing observations with the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 5 GHz and the Chinese VLBI Network (CVN) plus the Warkworth 30-metre telescope (New Zealand) at 8.6 GHz. By using the differential VLBI astrometry, we provide high-precision astrometric measurements on the parallax ($\pi=8.52_{-0.07}^{+0.04}$ mas), and proper motion ($\mu_{\alpha}=9.48_{-0.07}^{+0.04}$ mas yr$^{-1}$, $\mu_{\delta}=-51.32_{-0.38}^{+0.22}$ mas yr$^{-1}$). The new VLBI results agree with the optical Gaia astrometry. Our kinematic analysis reveals that the Galactic space velocities of AR Sco are quite consistent with that of both intermediate polars (IPs) and polars. Combined with the previous tightest VLBI constraint on the size, our parallax distance suggests that the radio emission of AR Sco should be located within the light cylinder of its white dwarf. |

|**Abstract**| We report the discovery with $TESS$ of a third set of eclipses from V994 Herculis (TIC 424508303), previously only known as a doubly-eclipsing system. The key implication of this discovery and our analyses is that V994 Her is the second fully-characterized (2+2) + 2 sextuple system, in which all three binaries eclipse. In this work, we use a combination of ground-based observations and $TESS$ data to analyze the eclipses of binaries A and B in order to update the parameters of the inner quadruple's orbit (with a derived period of 1062 $\pm$ 2d). The eclipses of binary C that were detected in the $TESS$ data were also found in older ground-based observations, as well as in more recently obtained observations. The eclipse timing variations of all three pairs were studied in order to detect the mutual perturbations of their constituent stars, as well as those of the inner pairs in the (2+2) core. At the longest periods they arise from apsidal motion, which may help constraining parameters of the component stars' internal structure. We also discuss the relative proximity of the periods of binaries A and B to a 3:2 mean motion resonance. This work represents a step forward in the development of techniques to better understand and characterize multiple star systems, especially those with multiple eclipsing components. |

|**Abstract**| PSR B1706$-$44 is an energetic gamma-ray pulsar located inside supernova remnant (SNR) G343.1$-$2.3 and it powers a compact pulsar wind nebula (PWN) that shows torus and jet structure in X-rays. We present a radio study of the PWN using Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) observations at 3, 6, 13, and 21\,cm. We found an overall arc-like morphology at 3 and 6\,cm, and the ``arc" shows two distinct peaks at 6\,cm. The radio emission is faint inside the X-ray PWN and only brightens beyond that. We develop a thick torus model with Doppler boosting effect to explain the radio PWN structure. The model suggests a bulk flow speed of $\sim 0.2c$, which could indicate significant deceleration of the flow from the X-ray emitting region. Our polarization result reveals a highly ordered toroidal $B$-field in the PWN. Its origin is unclear given that the supernova reverse shock should have interacted with the PWN. At a larger scale, the 13 and 21\,cm radio images detected a semi-circular rim and an east-west ridge of G343.1$-$2.3. We argue that the latter could possibly be a pulsar tail rather than a filament of the SNR, as supported by the flat radio spectrum and the alignment between the magnetic field and its elongation. |

|**Abstract**| In this work we report the independent discovery and analysis of nine new compact triply eclipsing triple star systems found with the TESS mission: TICs 47151245, 81525800, 99013269, 229785001, 276162169, 280883908, 294803663, 332521671, and 356324779. Each of these nine systems exhibits distinct third-body eclipses where the third (`tertiary') star occults the inner eclipsing binary (EB), or vice versa. We utilize a photodynamical analysis of the TESS photometry, archival photometric data, TESS eclipse timing variations of the EBs, available archival spectral energy distribution curves (SED), and, in some cases, newly acquired radial velocity observations, to solve for the parameters of all three stars, as well as most of the orbital elements. From these analyses we find that the outer orbits of all nine systems are viewed nearly edge on (i.e., within $\lesssim 4^\circ$), and 6 of the systems are coplanar to within $5^\circ$; the others have mutual inclination angles of $20^\circ$, $41^\circ$, and possibly $179^\circ$ (i.e., a retrograde outer orbit). The outer orbital periods range from 47.8 days to 604 days, with eccentricities spanning 0.004 to 0.61. The masses of all 18 EB stars are in the range of 0.9-2.6 M$_\odot$ and are mostly situated near the main sequence. By contrast, the masses and radii of the tertiary stars range from 1.4-2.8 M$_\odot$ and 1.5-13 R$_\odot$, respectively. We make use of the system parameters from these 9 systems, plus those from a comparable number of compact triply eclipsing triples published previously, to gain some statistical insight into their properties. |

|**Abstract**| While interstellar gas is known to be supersonically turbulent, the injection processes of this turbulence are still unclear. Many studies suggest a dominant role of gravitational instabilities. However, their effect on galaxy morphology and large-scale dynamics vary across cosmic times, in particular due to the evolution of the gas fraction of galaxies. In this paper, we propose numerical simulations to follow the isothermal turbulent cascade of purely gravitationally-driven turbulence from its injection scale down to 0.095 pc for a gas-poor spiral disk and a gas-rich clumpy disk. To this purpose, and to lift the memory-footprint technical lock of sufficiently resolving the interstellar medium of a galaxy, we developed an encapsulated zoom method that allows us to probe self-consistently the self-generated turbulence cascade over three orders of magnitude on spatial scales. We follow this cascade for 10 Myrs. We find that the turbulent cascade follows the same scaling laws in both setups. Namely, in both cases the turbulence is close to equipartition between its compressive and solenoidal modes, the velocity power spectrum follows the Burgers' scaling and the density power spectrum is rather shallow, with a power-law slope of -0.7. Last, gravitationally-bound substructures follow a mass distribution with a -1.8 slope, similar to that of CO clumps. These simulations thus suggest a universality of gravity-driven isothermal turbulent cascade in disk galaxies across cosmic time. |

|**Abstract**| We present high S/N measurements of the H I Ly alpha absorption line toward 16 Galactic targets which are at distances between approximately 190 and 2200 pc, all beyond the wall of the Local Bubble. We describe the models used to remove stellar emission and absorption features and the methods used to account for all known sources of error in order to compute high precision values of the H I column density with robust determinations of uncertainties. When combined with H2 column densities from other sources, we find total H column densities ranging from 10e20.01 to 10e21.25/cm2. Using deuterium column densities from FUSE observations we determine the D/H ratio along the sight lines. We confirm and strengthen the conclusion that D/H is spatially variable over these H I column density and target distance regimes, which predominantly probe the ISM outside the Local Bubble. We discuss how these results affect models of Galactic chemical evolution. We also present an analysis of metal lines along the five sight lines for which we have high resolution spectra and, along with results reported in the literature, discuss the corresponding column densities in the context of a generalized depletion analysis. We find that D/H is only weakly correlated with metal depletion and conclude that the spatial D/H variability is not solely due to dust depletion. A bifurcation of D/Htot as a function of depletion at high depletion levels provides modest support that deuterium-rich gas is infalling onto the Galactic plane. |

|**Abstract**| Context. Strong lenses are a biased subset of the general population of galaxies. Aims. The goal of this work is to quantify how lens galaxies and lensed sources differ from their parent distribution, namely the strong lensing bias. Methods. We first studied how the strong lensing cross-section varies as a function of lens and source properties. Then, we simulated strong lensing surveys with data similar to that expected for Euclid and measured the strong lensing bias in different scenarios. We focused particularly on two quantities: the stellar population synthesis mismatch parameter, $\alpha_{sps}$, defined as the ratio between the true stellar mass of a galaxy and the stellar mass obtained from photometry, and the central dark matter mass at fixed stellar mass and size. Results. Strong lens galaxies are biased towards larger stellar masses, smaller half-mass radii and larger dark matter masses. The amplitude of the bias depends on the intrinsic scatter in the mass-related parameters of the galaxy population and on the completeness in Einstein radius of the lens sample. For values of the scatter that are consistent with observed scaling relations and a minimum detectable Einstein radius of $0.5''$, the strong lensing bias in $\alpha_{sps}$ is $10\%$, while that in the central dark matter mass is $5\%$. The bias has little dependence on the properties of the source population: samples of galaxy-galaxy lenses and galaxy-quasar lenses that probe the same Einstein radius distribution are biased in a very similar way. Quadruply imaged quasar lenses, however, are biased towards higher ellipticity galaxies. Conclusions. Given current uncertainties, strong lensing observations can be used directly to improve our current knowledge of the inner structure of galaxies, without the need to correct for selection effects. |
