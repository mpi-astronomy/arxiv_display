|**Abstract**|            We investigate the properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the brightest submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the COSMOS field. We utilize the bright sample of ALMA/SCUBA-2 COSMOS Survey (AS2COSMOS), which consists of 260 SMGs with $S_{\mathrm{870}\, \mu \mathrm{m}}=0.7\text{--}19.2\,\mathrm{mJy}$ at $z=0\text{--}6$. We perform optical to millimeter spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling for the whole sample. We identify 24 AGN-host galaxies from the SEDs. Supplemented by 23 X-ray detected AGNs (X-ray AGNs), we construct an overall sample of 40 AGN-host galaxies. The X-ray luminosity upper bounds indicate that the X-ray undetected SED-identified AGNs are likely to be nearly Compton thick or have unusually suppressed X-ray emission. From visual classification, we identify $25^{+6}_{-5}$\% of the SMGs without AGNs as major merger candidates. This fraction is almost consistent with the general galaxy population at $z\sim2$, suggesting that major mergers are not necessarily required for the enhanced star formation in SMGs. We also identify $47^{+16}_{-15}$\% of the AGN hosts as major merger candidates, which is about twice as high as that in the SMGs without AGNs. This suggests that major mergers play a key role in triggering AGN activity in bright SMGs.         |

|**Abstract**|            Constraining the helium enhancement in stars is critical for understanding the formation mechanisms of multiple populations in star clusters. However, measuring helium variations for many stars within a cluster remains observationally challenging. We use Hubble Space Telescope photometry combined with MUSE spectroscopic data for over 7,200 red-giant branch stars in \omc\ to measure helium differences between distinct groups of stars as a function of metallicity separating the impact of helium enhancements from other abundance variations on the pseudo-color (chromosome) diagrams. Our results show that stars at all metallicities have subpopulations with significant helium enhancement ($\Delta Y_{min} \gtrsim$ 0.11). We find a rapid increase in helium enhancement from low metallicities ($\rm{[Fe/H] \simeq -2.05}$ to $\rm{[Fe/H] \simeq -1.92})$, with this enhancement leveling out at \deltay\ $= 0.154$ at higher metallicities. The fraction of helium-enhanced stars steadily increases with metallicity ranging from 10\% at $\rm{[Fe/H] \simeq -2.04}$ to over $90\%$ at $\rm{[Fe/H] \simeq -1.04}$. This study is the first to examine helium enhancement across the full range of metallicities in \omc{}, providing new insight into its formation history and additional constraints on enrichment mechanisms.         |

|**Abstract**|            Many classical Be stars acquire their very rapid rotation by mass and angular-momentum transfer in massive binaries. Short-lived intermediate-phase objects have only been discovered recently. Data archives and the literature have been searched for additional candidates exhibiting this patterns. Thirteen candidates were identified at various confidence levels. Adding to the two known systems identified as classical Be star+pre-subdwarf binaries (LB-1 and HR6819), two more (V742Cas, HD44637) could be confirmed with interferometry, with V742Cas setting a new record for the smallest visually observed angular semi-major axis, at a=0.663mas. Two further ones (V447Sct, V1362Cyg) are not resolved interferometrically, but other evidence puts them at the same confidence level as LB-1. V2174Cyg is a candidate with very high confidence, but was not observed interferometrically. The remaining ones are either candidates with varying levels of confidence. Of a mostly magnitude complete sample of 328 Be stars, 0.5-1% are found to have recently completed the mass overflow that led to their formation. Another 5% are systems with compact subdwarf companions, i.e., further evolved after a previous overflow, and possibly two more percent harbor white dwarfs. All these systems are of early B-subtypes, however, and if the original sample is restricted to early subtypes (136 objects), these percentages increase by a factor of about 2.5, while dropping to zero for the mid and late subtypes (together 204 objects). This strongly suggests that early- vs. mid- and late-type Be stars have differently weighted channels to acquire their rapid rotation, namely binary interaction vs. evolutionary spin-up.         |

|**Abstract**|            Broadband spectroscopic observations with high sensitivity provide an unbiased way to detect emissions of molecules in space. We present deep observations from ~ 105.8 GHz to 113.6 GHz toward 50 Galactic massive star-forming regions using IRAM 30-m millimeter telescope, with noise levels ranging from 6 to 29 at frequency channel spacing of 195 kHz, which corresponds to ~ 0.54 km/s at 110 GHz. Totally, 27 molecular species have been identified, of which 16 are complex organic molecules. The related parameters, such as peak temperature, integrated intensity, and line width of the identified molecular lines were obtained. The line widths of the chemically related molecules show strong positive correlations, suggesting they likely originate from similar gases within star-forming regions. This work highlights the fundamental properties of the detected molecular lines and offers a valuable dataset for further studies on the astrochemical evolution of molecules in massive star-forming cores.         |

|**Abstract**|            Observations of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the outskirts of galaxy clusters reveal shocks associated with gas accretion from the cosmic web. Previous work based on non-radiative cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have defined the shock radius, $r_\text{shock}$, using the ICM entropy, $K \propto T/{n_\mathrm{e}}^{2/3}$, where $T$ and $n_\text{e}$ are the ICM temperature and electron density respectively; the $r_\text{shock}$ is identified with either the radius at which $K$ is a maximum or at which its logarithmic slope is a minimum. We investigate the relationship between $r_\text{shock}$, which is driven by gravitational hydrodynamics and shocks, and the splashback radius, $r_\text{splash}$, which is driven by the gravitational dynamics of cluster stars and dark matter and is measured from their mass profile. Using 324 clusters from {\small The Three Hundred} project of cosmological galaxy formation simulations, we quantify statistically how $r_\text{shock}$ relates to $r_\text{splash}$. Depending on our definition, we find that the median $r_\text{shock} \simeq 1.38 r_\text{splash} (2.58 R_{200})$ when $K$ reaches its maximum and $r_\text{shock} \simeq 1.91 r_\text{splash} (3.54 R_{200})$ when its logarithmic slope is a minimum; the best-fit linear relation increases as $r_\text{shock} \propto 0.65 r_\text{splash}$. We find that $r_\text{shock}/R_{200}$ and $r_\text{splash}/R_{200}$ anti-correlate with virial mass, $M_{200}$, and recent mass accretion history, and $r_\text{shock}/r_\text{splash}$ tends to be larger for clusters with higher recent accretion rates. We discuss prospects for measuring $r_\text{shock}$ observationally and how the relationship between $r_\text{shock}$ and $r_\text{splash}$ can be used to improve constraints from radio, X-ray, and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich surveys that target the interface between the cosmic web and clusters.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a comprehensive analysis of a planetary microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-1609. The planetary anomaly was detected by two survey telescopes, OGLE and MOA. Each of these surveys collected enough data over the planetary anomaly to allow for an unambiguous planet detection. Such survey detections of planetary anomalies are needed to build a robust sample of planets that could improve studies on the microlensing planetary occurrence rate by reducing biases and statistical uncertainties. In this work, we examined different methods for modeling microlensing events using individual datasets, particularly we incorporated a Galactic model prior to better constrain poorly defined microlensing parallax. Ultimately, we fitted a comprehensive model to all available data, identifying three potential typologies, with two showing comparably high Bayesian evidence. Our analysis indicates that the host of the planet is a brown dwarf with a probability of 34%, or a low-mass stellar object (M-dwarf) with the probability of 66%.         |
