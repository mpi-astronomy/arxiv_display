|**Abstract**|            Bars are remarkable stellar structures that can transport gas toward centers and drive the secular evolution of galaxies. In this context, it is important to locate dynamical resonances associated with bars. For this study, we used ${Spitzer}$ near-infrared images as a proxy for the stellar gravitational potential and the ALMA CO(J=2-1) gas distribution from the PHANGS survey to determine the position of the main dynamical resonances associated with the bars in the PHANGS sample of 74 nearby star-forming galaxies. We used the gravitational torque method to estimate the location of the bar corotation radius ($R_{\rm CR}$), where stars and gas rotate at the same angular velocity as the bar. Of the 46 barred galaxies in PHANGS, we have successfully determined the corotation (CR) for 38 of them. The mean ratio of the $R_{\rm CR}$ to the bar radius ($R_{\rm bar}$) is $\mathcal{R} = R_{\rm CR}/R_{\rm bar} = 1.12$, with a standard deviation of $0.39$. This is consistent with the average value expected from theory and suggests that bars are predominantly fast. We also compared our results with other bar CR measurements from the literature, which employ different methods, and find good agreement ($\rho = 0.64$). Finally, using rotation curves, we have estimated other relevant resonances such as the inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) and the outer Lindblad resonance (OLR), which are often associated with rings. This work provides a useful catalog of resonances for a large sample of nearby galaxies and emphasizes the clear connection between bar dynamics and morphology.         |

|**Abstract**|            Based on the high resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra, we derived the chemical abundances of 20 elements for 20 barium (Ba-) stars. For the first time, the detailed abundances of four sample stars, namely HD 92482, HD 150430, HD 151101 and HD 177304 have been analyzed. Additionally, Ba element abundance has been measured using high resolution spectra for the first time in six of the other 16 sample stars. Based on the [s/Fe] ratios, the Ba-unknown star HD 115927 can be classified as a strong Ba-star, while the Ba-likely star HD 160538 can be categorized into a mild Ba-star. Consequently, our sample comprises three strong and 17 mild Ba-stars. The light odd-Z metal elements and Fe-peak elements exhibit near-solar abundances. The [{\alpha}/Fe] ratios demonstrate decreasing trends with increasing metallicity. Moreover, the abundances of n-capture elements show significant enhancements in different degrees. Using a threshold of the signed distances to the solar r-process abundance pattern ds = 0.6, we find that all of our sample stars are normal Ba-stars, indicating that the enhancements of s-process elements should be attributed to material transfer from their companions. We compare the observed n-capture patterns of sample stars with the FRUITY models, and estimate the mass of the Thermally-Pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch stars that previously contaminated the Ba-stars. The models with low masses can successfully explain the observations. From a kinematic point of view, we note that most of our sample stars are linked with the thin disk, while HD 130255 may be associated with the thick disk.         |

|| L. Cesario, et al. -- incl., <mark>S. Kraus</mark>, <mark>J. Mathew</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            The increased brightness temperature of young rocky protoplanets during their magma ocean epoch makes them potentially amenable to atmospheric characterization to distances from the solar system far greater than thermally equilibrated terrestrial exoplanets, offering observational opportunities for unique insights into the origin of secondary atmospheres and the near surface conditions of prebiotic environments. The Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) mission will employ a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer to directly measure the thermal emission of terrestrial exoplanets. Here, we seek to assess the capabilities of various instrumental design choices of the LIFE mission concept for the detection of cooling protoplanets with transient high-temperature magma ocean atmospheres, in young stellar associations in particular. Using the LIFE mission instrument simulator (LIFEsim) we assess how specific instrumental parameters and design choices, such as wavelength coverage, aperture diameter, and photon throughput, facilitate or disadvantage the detection of protoplanets. We focus on the observational sensitivities of distance to the observed planetary system, protoplanet brightness temperature using a blackbody assumption, and orbital distance of the potential protoplanets around both G- and M-dwarf stars. Our simulations suggest that LIFE will be able to detect (S/N $\geq$ 7) hot protoplanets in young stellar associations up to distances of $\approx$100 pc from the solar system for reasonable integration times (up to $\sim$hours). Detection of an Earth-sized protoplanet orbiting a solar-sized host star at 1 AU requires less than 30 minutes of integration time. M-dwarfs generally need shorter integration times. The contribution from wavelength regions $<$6 $\mu$m is important for decreasing the detection threshold and discriminating emission temperatures.         |
