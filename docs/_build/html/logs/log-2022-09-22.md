|**Abstract**| The CLusters in the Uv as EngineS (CLUES) survey is a Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) campaign aimed at acquiring the 1130 to 1770 {\AA}, restframe spectroscopy of very young (<20 Myr) and massive (>10^4 solar masses) star clusters in galaxies that are part of the Hubble treasury program Legacy ExtraGalactic Uv Survey (LEGUS). In this first paper of a series, we describe the CLUES sample consisting of 20 young star clusters and report their physical properties as derived by both multi-wavelength photometry and far-UV (FUV) spectroscopy with Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Thanks to the synergy of the two different datasets we build a coherent picture of the diverse stellar populations found in each region (with sizes of 40 to 160 pc). We associate the FUV-brightest stellar population to the central targeted star cluster and the other modeled population to the diffuse stars that are included in the COS aperture. We observe better agreement between photometric and spectroscopic ages for star clusters younger than 5 Myr. For clusters older than 5 Myr, photometry and spectroscopy measurements deviate, with the latter producing older ages, due to the degeneracy of photometric models. FUV spectroscopy enables us to better constrain the stellar metallicities, a parameter that optical colors are insensitive to. Finally, the derived E(B-V) are quite similar, with a tendency for FUV spectroscopy to favor solutions with higher extinctions. The recovered masses are in agreement within a factor of 2 for all the clusters. |

|**Abstract**| Solar magnetic activity produces extreme solar flares and coronal mass ejections, which pose grave threats to electronic infrastructure and can significantly disrupt economic activity. It is therefore important to appreciate the triggers of explosive solar activity and develop reliable space-weather forecasting. Photospheric vector-magnetic-field data capture sunspot magnetic-field complexity and can therefore improve the quality of space-weather prediction. However, state-of-the-art vector-field observations are consistently only available from Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI) since 2010, with most other current and past missions and observational facilities such as Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) only recording line-of-sight (LOS) fields. Here, using an inception-based convolutional neural network, we reconstruct HMI sunspot vector-field features from LOS magnetograms of HMI as well as GONG with high fidelity (~ 90% correlation) and sustained flare-forecasting accuracy. We rebuild vector-field features during the 2003 Halloween storms, for which only LOS-field observations are available, and the CNN-estimated electric-current-helicity accurately captures the observed rotation of the associated sunspot prior to the extreme flares, showing a striking increase. Our study thus paves the way for reconstructing three solar cycles worth of vector-field data from past LOS measurements, which are of great utility in improving space-weather forecasting models and gaining new insights about solar activity. |

|**Abstract**| Hot subdwarf B stars are core-helium burning objects that have undergone envelope stripping, likely by a binary companion. Using high-speed photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we have discovered the hot subdwarf BPM 36430 is a hybrid sdBV_rs pulsator exhibiting several low-amplitude g-modes and a strong p-mode pulsation. The latter shows a clear, periodic variation in its pulse arrival times. Fits to this phase oscillation imply BPM 36430 orbits a barycenter approximately 10 light-seconds away once every 3.1 d. Using the CHIRON echelle spectrograph on the CTIO 1.5-m telescope, we confirm the reflex motion by detecting a radial velocity variation with semi-amplitude, period, and phase in agreement with the pulse timings. We conclude that a white dwarf companion with minimum mass of 0.42 Msun orbits BPM 36430. Our study represents only the second time a companion orbiting a pulsating hot subdwarf or white dwarf has been detected from pulse timings and confirmed with radial velocities. |

|**Abstract**| The masses of compact objects in X-ray binaries are best constrained through dynamical measurements, relying on radial velocity curves of the companion star. In anticipation of upcoming high X-ray spectral resolution telescopes, we explore their potential to constrain the mass function of the compact object. Fe K line fluorescence is a common feature in the spectra of luminous X-ray binaries, with a Doppler-broadened component from the inner accretion disc extensively studied. If a corresponding narrow line from the X-ray irradiated companion can be isolated, this provides am opportunity to further constrain the binary system properties. Here, we model binary geometry to determine the companion star's solid angle, and deduce the iron line's equivalent width. We find that for systems with a mass ratio $q > 0.1$, the expected K${\alpha}$ equivalent width is 2-40 eV. Simulations using XSPEC indicate that new microcalorimeters will have sufficient resolution to be able to produce K${\alpha}$ emission line radial velocity measurements with precision of 5-40 km s$^{-1}$, for source continuum fluxes exceeding $10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Several caveats need to be considered; this method is dependent on successful isolation of the narrow line from the broad component, and the observation of clear changes in velocity independent of scatter arising from complex wind and disc behaviour. These issues remain to be proven with microcalorimeters, but this method has the potential to constrain binary parameters where optical measurements are not viable. |

|*Appeared on*| *2022-09-22*|

|**Abstract**| We report on the polarized light curves of the Galactic Center supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, obtained at millimeter wavelength with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The observations took place as a part of the Event Horizon Telescope campaign. We compare the observations taken during the low variability source state on 2017 Apr 6 and 7 with those taken immediately after the X-ray flare on 2017 Apr 11. For the latter case, we observe rotation of the electric vector position angle with a timescale of $\sim 70$ min. We interpret this rotation as a signature of the equatorial clockwise orbital motion of a hot spot embedded in a magnetic field dominated by a dynamically important vertical component, observed at a low inclination $\sim20^\circ$. The hot spot radiates strongly polarized synchrotron emission, briefly dominating the linear polarization measured by ALMA in the unresolved source. Our simple emission model captures the overall features of the polarized light curves remarkably well. Assuming a Keplerian orbit, we find the hot spot orbital radius to be $\sim$ 5 Schwarzschild radii. We observe hints of a positive black hole spin, that is, a prograde hot spot motion. Accounting for the rapidly varying rotation measure, we estimate the projected on-sky axis of the angular momentum of the hot spot to be $\sim 60^\circ$ east of north, with a 180$^\circ$ ambiguity. These results suggest that the accretion structure in Sgr A* is a magnetically arrested disk rotating clockwise. |

|*Appeared on*| *2022-09-22*|

|**Abstract**| We derive the most up-to-date Swift-Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) blazar luminosity function in the 14-195 keV range, making use of a clean sample of 118 blazars detected in the BAT 105-month survey catalog, with newly obtained redshifts from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS). We determine the best-fit X-ray luminosity function for the whole blazar population, as well as for Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) alone. The main results are: (1) at any redshift, BAT detects the most luminous blazars, above any possible break in their luminosity distribution, which means we cannot differentiate between density and luminosity evolution; (2) the whole blazar population, dominated by FSRQs, evolves positively up to redshift z~4.3, confirming earlier results and implying lower number densities of blazars at higher redshifts than previously estimated. The contribution of this source class to the Cosmic X-ray Background at 14-195 keV can range from 5-18%, while possibly accounting for 100% of the MeV background. We also derived the average 14 keV-10 GeV SED for BAT blazars, which allows us to predict the number counts of sources in the MeV range, as well as the expected number of high-energy (>100 TeV) neutrinos. A mission like COSI, will detect 40 MeV blazars and 2 coincident neutrinos. Finally, taking into account beaming selection effects, the distribution and properties of the parent population of these extragalactic jets are derived. We find that the distribution of viewing angles is quite narrow, with most sources aligned within < 5{\deg} of the line of sight. Moreover, the average Lorentz factor, <$\Gamma$>= 8-12, is lower than previously suggested for these powerful sources. |

|**Abstract**| We verified for photometric stability a set of DA white dwarfs with Hubble Space Telescope magnitudes from the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared and ground-based spectroscopy by using time-spaced observations from the Las Cumbres Observatory network of telescopes. The initial list of 38 stars was whittled to 32 final ones which comprise a high quality set of spectrophotometric standards. These stars are homogeneously distributed around the sky and are all fainter than r ~ 16.5 mag. Their distribution is such that at least two of them would be available to be observed from any observatory on the ground at any time at airmass less than two. Light curves and different variability indices from the Las Cumbres Observatory data were used to determine the stability of the candidate standards. When available, Pan-STARRS1, Zwicky Transient Facility and TESS data were also used to confirm the star classification. Our analysis showed that four DA white dwarfs may exhibit evidence of photometric variability, while a fifth is cooler than our established lower temperature limit, and a sixth star might be a binary. In some instances, due to the presence of faint nearby red sources, care should be used when observing a few of the spectrophotometric standards with ground-based telescopes. Light curves and finding charts for all the stars are provided. |

|**Abstract**| Radio relics are Mpc-sized synchrotron sources located in the peripheral regions of galaxy clusters. Models based on the diffuse shock acceleration (DSA) scenario have been widely accepted to explain the formation of radio relics. However, a critical challenge to these models is that most observed shocks seem too weak to generate detectable emission, unless fossil electrons, a population of mildly energetic electrons that have been accelerated previously, are included in the models. To address this issue, we present a new semi-analytical model to describe the formation and evolution of radio relics by incorporating fossil relativistic electrons into DSA theory, which is constrained by a sample of 14 observed relics, and employ the Press-Schechter formalism to simulate the relics in a $20^{\circ} \times 20^{\circ}$ sky field at 50, 158, and 1400 MHz, respectively. Results show that fossil electrons contribute significantly to the radio emission, which can generate radiation four orders of magnitude brighter than that solely produced by thermal electrons at 158 MHz, and the power distribution of our simulated radio relic catalog can reconcile the observed $P_{1400}-M_{\mathrm{vir}}$ relation. We predict that $7.1\%$ clusters with $M_{\mathrm{vir}} > 1.2\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ would host relics at 158 MHz, which is consistent with the result of $10 \pm 6\%$ given by the LoTSS DR2. It is also found that radio relics are expected to cause severe foreground contamination in future EoR experiments, similar to that of radio halos. The possibility of AGN providing seed fossil relativistic electrons is evaluated by calculating the number of radio-loud AGNs that a shock is expected to encounter during its propagation. |

|**Abstract**| We present the visual orbits of four spectroscopic binary stars, HD 61859, HD 89822, HD 109510, and HD 191692, using long baseline interferometry with the CHARA Array. We also obtained new radial velocities from echelle spectra using the APO 3.5 m, CTIO 1.5 m, and Fairborn Observatory 2.0 m telescopes. By combining the astrometric and spectroscopic observations, we solve for the full, three-dimensional orbits and determine the stellar masses to 1-12% uncertainty and distances to 0.4-6% uncertainty. We then estimate the effective temperature and radius of each component star through Doppler tomography and spectral energy distribution analyses. We found masses of 1.4-3.5 Msun, radii of 1.5-4.7 Rsun, and temperatures of 6400-10300K. We then compare the observed stellar parameters to the predictions of the stellar evolution models, but found that only one of our systems fits well with the evolutionary models. |

|**Abstract**| Aims: The large abundances of CH$^+$ in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) are a long standing issue of our understanding of the thermodynamical and chemical states of the gas. We investigate, here, the formation of CH+ in turbulent and multiphase environments, where the heating of the gas is almost solely driven by the photoelectric effect. Methods: The diffuse ISM is simulated using the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code RAMSES which self-consistently computes the dynamical and thermal evolution of the gas along with the time-dependent evolutions of the abundances of H$^+$, H, and H$_2$. The rest of the chemistry, including the abundance of CH$^+$, is computed in post-processing, at equilibrium, under the constraint of out-ofequilibrium of H$^+$, H, and H$_2$. The comparison with the observations is performed taking into account an often neglected, yet paramount, piece of information, namely the length of the intercepted diffuse matter along the observed lines of sight. Results: The quasi totality of the mass of CH$^+$ originates from the unstable gas, in environments where the kinetic temperature is larger than 600 K, the density ranges between 0.6 and 10 cm$^{-3}$, the electronic fraction ranges between 3 x 10$^{-4}$ and 6 x 10$^{-3}$, and the molecular fraction is smaller than 0.4. Its formation is driven by warm and out-of-equilibrium H$_2$ initially formed in the cold neutral medium (CNM) and injected in more diffuse environments and even the warm neutral medium (WNM) through a combination of advection and thermal instability. The simulation which displays the tightest agreement with the HI-to-H$_2$ transition and the thermal pressure distribution observed in the Solar Neighborhood is found to naturally reproduce the observed abundances of CH$^+$, the dispersion of observations, the probability of occurrence of most of the lines of sight, the fraction of non-detections of CH$^+$, and the distribution of its line profiles. The amount of CH$^+$ and the statistical properties of the simulated lines of sight are set by the fraction of unstable gas rich in H$_2$ which is controlled, on Galactic scales, by the mean density of the diffuse ISM (or, equivalently, its total mass), the amplitude of the mean UV radiation field, and the strength of the turbulent forcing. Conclusions: This work offers a new and natural solution to an 80 years old chemical riddle. The almost ubiquitous presence of CH$^+$ in the diffuse ISM likely results from the exchanges of matter between the CNM and the WNM induced by the combination of turbulent advection and thermal instability, without the need to invoke ambipolar diffusion or regions of intermittent turbulent dissipation. Through two phase turbulent mixing, CH$^+$ might thus be a tracer of the H$_2$ mass loss rate of CNM clouds. |

|**Abstract**| We present radio [1.3 GHz MeerKAT, 4-8 GHz Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and 15.5 GHz Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array (AMI-LA)] and X-ray (Swift and MAXI) data from the 2019 outburst of the candidate Black Hole X-ray Binary (BHXB) EXO 1846-031. We compute a Hardness-Intensity diagram, which shows the characteristic q-shaped hysteresis of BHXBs in outburst. EXO 1846-031 was monitored weekly with MeerKAT and approximately daily with AMI-LA. The VLA observations provide sub-arcsecond-resolution images at key points in the outburst, showing moving radio components. The radio and X-ray light curves broadly follow each other, showing a peak on ~MJD 58702, followed by a short decline before a second peak between ~MJD 58731-58739. We estimate the minimum energy of these radio flares from equipartition, calculating values of $E_{\rm min} \sim$ 4$\times$10$^{41}$ and 5$\times$10$^{42}$ erg, respectively. The exact date of the return to `quiescence' is missed in the X-ray and radio observations, but we suggest that it likely occurred between MJD 58887 and 58905. From the Swift X-ray flux on MJD 58905 and assuming the soft-to-hard transition happened at 0.3-3 per cent Eddington, we calculate a distance range of 2.4-7.5\,kpc. We computed the radio:X-ray plane for EXO 1846-031 in the `hard' state, showing that it is most likely a `radio-quiet' BH, preferentially at 4.5 kpc. Using this distance and a jet inclination angle of $\theta$=73$^{\circ}$, the VLA data place limits on the intrinsic jet speed of $\beta_{\rm int} = 0.29c$, indicating sub-luminal jet motion. |

|**Abstract**| Galaxy clusters are useful laboratories to investigate the evolution of the Universe, and accurately measuring their total masses allows us to constrain important cosmological parameters. However, estimating mass from observations that use different methods and spectral bands introduces various systematic errors. This paper evaluates the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to reliably and accurately infer the masses of galaxy clusters from the Compton-y parameter maps provided by the Planck satellite. The CNN is trained with mock images generated from hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters, with Planck's observational limitations taken into account. We observe that the CNN approach is not subject to the usual observational assumptions, and so is not affected by the same biases. By applying the trained CNNs to the real Planck maps, we find cluster masses compatible with Planck measurements within a 15% bias. Finally, we show that this mass bias can be explained by the well known hydrostatic equilibrium assumption in Planck masses, and the different parameters in the Y500-M500 scaling laws. This work highlights that CNNs, supported by hydrodynamic simulations, are a promising and independent tool for estimating cluster masses with high accuracy, which can be extended to other surveys as well as to observations in other bands. |

|**Abstract**| The X-ray light curves of accreting black holes and neutron stars in binary systems show various types of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), the origin of which is still debated. The Relativistic Precession Model identifies the QPO frequencies with fundamental time scales from General Relativity, and has been proposed as a possible explanation of certain types of such oscillations. Under specific conditions (i.e., the detection of a particular QPOs triplet) such a model can be used to obtain self-consistent measurements of the mass and spin of the compact object. So far this has been possible only in the black hole binary GRO J1655-40. In the RXTE/PCA data from the 1999-2000 outburst of the black hole transient XTE J1859+226 we found a QPO triplet, and used the the Relativistic Precession Model to obtain high-precision measurements of the black hole mass and spin - M = (7.85+/-0.46) Msun, a* = 0.149+/-0.005 - the former being consistent with the most recent dynamical mass determination from optical measurements. Similarly to what has been already observed in other black hole systems, the frequencies of the QPOs and broad-band noise components match the general relativistic frequencies of particle motion close to the compact object predicted by the model. Our findings confirm previous results and further support the validity of the Relativistic Precession Model, which is the only electromagnetic-measurement-based method that so far has consistently yielded spins close to those from the gravitational waves produced by merging binary black holes. |

|**Abstract**| The Extremely Low Mass White Dwarfs (ELM WDs) and pre-ELM WDs are helium core white dwarfs with mass $<\sim 0.3M_{\odot}$. They are formed in close binaries and have lost over half of their initial masses via Common Envelope (CE) ejection or stable Roche Lobe Over Flow (RLOF). Both evolution simulations and observations show that a lower mass limit for ELM WDs exists at $\approx0.14M_{\odot}$. Here we report the discovery of an extremely low mass ELM WD, ID70904216 in LAMOST survey, that may be lower than the ELM WD mass limit. Based on LAMOST and P200 spectroscopic observations, ID70904216 shows orbital period $P_{orb} =$ 0.219658 days and radial velocity semi-amplitude $K1=317.33km/s$, which gives the mass function of 0.73$M_{\odot}$, indicating the companion is a compact star. The low resolution spectra shows a F type star with $T_{\rm eff} \sim 7361K$ without emission features. The temperature is consistent with that derived from SED fitting($7440K$) and multi-color light curve solution($7400K$). The optical light curves, in ZTF g, r and i bands and Catalina V band, show ellipsoidal variability with amplitudes $\approx30\%$, suggesting that the visible companion is heavily tidal distorted. Combining with the distance from Gaia survey, the WD code modeling estimates that the mass of the visible star is $M1=0.08^{+0.06}_{-0.03}M_{\odot}$, and the mass of the invisible star is $M2=0.94^{+0.45}_{-0.10}M_{\odot}$. The radius of the visible donor is $R=0.29\pm0.01R_{\odot}$. The inclination angle is constrained between 60$^{\circ}$ and 90$^{\circ}$. The observations indicate the system is a pre-ELM WD + WD/NS binary system with an extremely low mass hot donor below the $0.14M_{\odot}$ theoretical limit. |

|**Abstract**| We present two contiguous nights of simultaneous time-resolved GTC spectroscopy and WHT photometry of the black hole X-ray transient XTE J1859+226, obtained in 2017 July during quiescence. Cross-correlation of the individual spectra against a late K-type spectral template enabled us to constrain the orbital period to $0.276 \pm 0.003$ d and the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the donor star to $K_2 = 550 \pm 59$ km s$^{-1}$. An ellipsoidal modulation is detected in the photometric $r$- and $i$-band light curves, although it is strongly contaminated by flickering activity. By exploiting correlations between the properties of the double-peaked H$\alpha$ emission-line profile and the binary parameters, we derived an orbital inclination of $66.6 \pm 4.3$ deg, a refined $K_2 = 562 \pm 40$ km s$^{-1}$ and mass ratio $q = M_2/M_1 = 0.07 \pm 0.01$. From these values we obtained an updated black hole mass of $M_1 = 7.8 \pm 1.9$ M$_\odot$. An independent mass estimate based on X-ray timing agrees well with our value, which gives further support for the outburst QPO triplet being explained by the relativistic precession model. We also obtained a companion star mass $M_2 = 0.55 \pm 0.16$ M$_\odot$, which is consistent with its K5-K7 V spectral type. |

|**Abstract**| Using wavelet analysis and power density spectrum, we investigate two transient quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in MAXI J1535$-$571 observed with Insight-HXMT. The transient QPOs have a centroid frequency of $\sim 10$ Hz with a FWHM $\sim 0.6$ Hz and an rms amplitude $\sim 14\%$. Energy spectra of QPO and non-QPO regimes are also separated and analyzed, and the spectra become softer with higher $E_{cut}$ in the non-QPO regime compared to the QPO regime. Our results suggest that the transient QPOs detected in MJD 58016 and 58017 are still the type-C QPO, and the source remains in its HIMS. The duration of all type-C QPO signals based on wavelet is positively correlated with the mean count rate above $\sim 10$ keV, implying appearance of QPOs in different time scales should be coupled with the corona. The transient QPO properties could be related to the jet or flares, perhaps the partial ejection of the corona is responsible for the disappearance of the type-C QPO. |

|**Abstract**| We studied the millihertz quasi-periodic oscillation (mHz QPO) in the 2020 outburst of the Be/X-ray binary 1A 0535+262 using Insight-HXMT data over a broad energy band. The mHz QPO is detected in the 27-120 keV energy band. The QPO centroid frequency is correlated with the source flux, and evolves in the 35-95 mHz range during the outburst. The QPO is most significant in the 50-65 keV band, with a significance of ~ 8 sigma, but is hardly detectable (<2 sigma) in the lowest (1-27 keV) and highest (>120 keV) energy bands. Notably, the detection of mHz QPO above 80 keV is the highest energy at which mHz QPOs have been detected so far. The fractional rms of the mHz QPO first increases and then decreases with energy, reaching the maximum amplitude at 50-65 keV. In addition, at the peak of the outburst, the mHz QPO shows a double-peak structure, with the difference between the two peaks being constant at ~0.02 Hz, twice the spin frequency of the neutron star in this system. We discuss different scenarios explaining the generation of the mHz QPO, including the beat frequency model, the Keplerian frequency model, the model of two jets in opposite directions, and the precession of the neutron star, but find that none of them can explain the origin of the QPO well. We conclude that the variability of non-thermal radiation may account for the mHz QPO, but further theoretical studies are needed to reveal the physical mechanism. |

|**Abstract**| On its journey through the Galaxy, the Sun passes through diverse regions of the interstellar medium. High-resolution spectroscopic measurements of interstellar absorption lines in spectra of nearby stars show absorption components from more than a dozen warm partially ionized clouds within 15 pc of the Sun. The two nearest clouds - the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) and Galactic (G) cloud - move toward each other. Their bulk heliocentric velocities can be compared with the interstellar neutral helium flow velocity obtained from space-based experiments. We combine recent results from Ulysses, IBEX, and STEREO observations to find a more accurate estimate of the velocity and temperature of the very local interstellar medium. We find that, contrary to the widespread viewpoint that the Sun resides inside the LIC, the locally observed velocity of the interstellar neutral helium is consistent with a linear combination of the velocities of the LIC and G cloud, but not with either of these two velocities. This finding shows that the Sun travels through a mixed-cloud interstellar medium composed of material from both these clouds. Interactions between these clouds explain the substantially higher density of the interstellar hydrogen near the Sun and toward stars located within the interaction region of these two clouds. The observed asymmetry of the interstellar helium distribution function also supports this interaction. The structure and equilibrium in this region require further studies using in situ and telescopic observations. |

|**Abstract**| We report the Sr and Ba isotopic compositions of 18 presolar SiC grains of types Y (11) and Z (7), rare types commonly argued to have formed in lower-than-solar metallicity asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We find that the Y and Z grains show higher 88Sr/87Sr and more variable 138Ba/136Ba ratios than mainstream (MS) grains. According to FRANEC Torino AGB models, the Si, Sr, and Ba isotopic compositions of our Y and Z grains can be consistently explained if the grains came from low mass AGB stars with 0.15 Zsun <= Z < 1.00 Zsun, in which the 13C neutron exposure for the slow neutron-capture process is greatly reduced with respect to that required by MS grains for a 1.0 Z8 AGB star. This scenario is in line with the previous finding based on Ti isotopes, but it fails to explain the indistinguishable Mo isotopic compositions of MS, Y, and Z grains. |

|**Abstract**| Current and future imaging surveys require photometric redshifts (photo-z) to be estimated for millions of galaxies. Improving the photo-z quality is a major challenge to advance our understanding of cosmology. In this paper, we explore how the synergies between narrow-band photometric data and large imaging surveys can be exploited to improve broad-band photometric redshifts. We use a multi-task learning (MTL) network to improve broad-band photo-z estimates by simultaneously predicting the broad-band photo-z and the narrow-band photometry from the broad-band photometry. The narrow-band photometry is only required in the training field, which enables better photo-z predictions also for the galaxies without narrow-band photometry in the wide field. This technique is tested with data from the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS) in the COSMOS field. We find that the method predicts photo-z that are 14% more precise down to magnitude i_AB<23, while reducing the outlier rate by 40% with respect to the baseline network mapping broad-band colours to only photo-zs. Furthermore, MTL significantly reduces the photo-z bias for high-redshift galaxies, improving the redshift distributions for tomographic bins with z>1. Applying this technique to deeper samples is crucial for future surveys like \Euclid or LSST. For simulated data, training on a sample with i_AB <23, the method reduces the photo-z scatter by 15% for all galaxies with 24<i_AB<25. We also study the effects of extending the training sample with photometric galaxies using PAUS high-precision photo-zs, which further reduces the photo-z scatter. |
