|**Abstract**|            Kilonovae, the ultraviolet/optical/infrared counterparts to binary neutron star mergers, are an exceptionally rare class of transients. Optical follow-up campaigns are plagued by impostors whose early evolution masquerades as the rapid radioactive decay of heavy elements. In this work, we present an analysis of the multi-wavelength dataset of supernova (SN) 2025ulz, a proposed kilonova candidate following the low-significance detection of gravitational waves originating from the potential binary neutron star merger S250818k. Despite an early rapid decline in brightness, our multi-wavelength observations of SN 2025ulz reveal that it is a type IIb supernova. As part of this analysis, we demonstrate the capabilities of a novel quantitative scoring algorithm to determine the likelihood that a transient candidate is a kilonova, based primarily on its 3D location and light curve evolution. We also apply our scoring algorithm to other transient candidates in the localization volume of S250818k and find that, at all times after the discovery of SN 2025ulz, there are $\geq 4$ candidates with a score more promising than SN 2025ulz. During future kilonova searches, this type of scoring algorithm will be useful to rule out contaminating transients in real time, optimizing the use of valuable telescope resources.         |

|| E. Collaboration, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. Jahnke</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-21*|
|*Comments*| *13 pages, 7 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            We compare the performance of the flat-sky approximation and Limber approximation for the clustering analysis of the photometric galaxy catalogue of Euclid. We study a 6 bin configuration representing the first data release (DR1) and a 13 bin configuration representative of the third and final data release (DR3). We find that the Limber approximation is sufficiently accurate for the analysis of the wide bins of DR1. Contrarily, the 13 bins of DR3 cannot be modelled accurately with the Limber approximation. Instead, the flat-sky approximation is accurate to below $5\%$ in recovering the angular power spectra of galaxy number counts in both cases and can be used to simplify the computation of the full power spectrum in harmonic space for the data analysis of DR3.         |

|| L. A. Boogaard, et al. -- incl., <mark>F. Walter</mark> |

|*Comments*| *20 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables. Accepted for publication in ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            We present high-resolution (0.13"-0.23") NOEMA observations of the dust continuum emission at 1.1 mm (rest-frame 220 micron) and JWST/NIRCam and MIRI imaging of the z=4.055 starburst galaxy GN20. The sensitive NOEMA imaging at 1.6 kpc resolution reveals extended dust emission, ~14 kpc in diameter (r_e~2.5 kpc, b/a=0.5), that is centrally asymmetric and clumpy. The dust emission is as extended as the stellar emission and the molecular gas traced by CO(2-1), with a common center, and is brightest in the strongly-obscured nuclear part of the galaxy. Approximately one-third of the total dust emission emerges from the nucleus and the most prominent clump to the south, and (only) 60% from the central 3.5x1.5 kpc (0.5"-0.2"), implying that the starburst is very extended. The combined JWST and NOEMA morphology suggests GN20 experienced a recent interaction or merger, likely invigorating the starburst. The radial surface brightness profiles of the molecular gas and near-IR stellar emission are similar, while in contrast, the dust emission appears significantly more concentrated. Through self-consistent radiative transfer modeling of the integrated and resolved CO and dust emission, we derive an $M_{mol}=2.9^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\times10^{11}$ Msun with $\alpha_{CO}=2.8^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$. We find that the extended dust implies a lower global dust optical depth than previously reported, but a high dust mass of $M_{dust}=5.7^{+0.8}_{-0.6}\times 10^{9}$ Msun and gas-to-dust ratio of ~50. Furthermore, we show the distinct apparent radial profiles of the gas and dust can be explained purely by radiative transfer effects and the observations are consistent with the gas and dust mass being similarly distributed throughout the starburst. The latter highlights the importance of accounting for radiative transfer effects when comparing molecular gas and dust distributions from different tracers.         |

|**Abstract**|            Ground-based long baseline interferometry is a powerful tool for characterizing exoplanets which are too close to their host star to be imaged with single-dish telescopes. The CHARA Array can resolve companions down to 0.5 milli-arcseconds, allowing us in principle to directly measure the near-infrared spectra of non-transiting "Hot Jupiter" exoplanets. We present data taken with the MIRC-X and MYSTIC instruments at the CHARA Array on the Hot Jupiter Upsilon Andromedae b. By resolving the star-planet system, we attempt to directly detect the flux from the planet. We describe our self-calibration methods for modeling systematics in the closure phase data, which allows us to reach sub-degree precision. Through combining multiple nights of data across two MIRC-X runs in 2019 and 2021, we achieved a very tentative detection of Ups And b in the H-band at a planet/star contrast of 2-3 x 10^-4. Unfortunately, we cannot confirm this detection with 2021 MYSTIC data in the K-band, or in a 2023 joint MIRC-X and MYSTIC dataset. We run updated global circulation models and create post-processed spectra for this planet, and report the resulting model spectra in H- and K-bands as a function of orbital phase. We then run planetary injection tests to explore H/K-band contrast limits, and find that we can confidently recover planets down to a planet/star contrast of 1-2 x 10^-4. We show that we are probing contrasts fainter than predicted by the model, making our non-detection surprising. We discuss prospects for the future in using this method to characterize companions with interferometry.         |

|| C. Y. Lam, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. El-Badry</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-21*|

|**Abstract**|            Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) above $30 M_\odot$ are predicted to form from low-metallicity progenitors, but direct detections of such systems in the Milky Way remain scarce. Motivated by the recent discovery of Gaia BH3, a $33 M_\odot$ BH with a very metal-poor giant companion, we conduct a systematic search for additional systems. Approximately 900 candidates are identified with Gaia as having significant deviations from single-star astrometric motion, evidence of RV variability, and low metallicities inferred from Gaia XP spectra. We obtain single epoch high-resolution spectra for over 600 of these sources with Magellan/MIKE and Lick/APF and measure independent RVs with $\approx 1$ km s$^{-1}$ precision. After removing contaminants such as hot stars, pulsators, eclipsing binaries, and hierarchical triples, we identify about 15 promising candidates with large RV amplitudes or offsets from the Gaia reported values. This program establishes a well-characterized sample of BH candidates for detailed orbital modeling once Gaia DR4 epoch astrometry and RVs are released in late 2026; multi-epoch RV follow-up is ongoing. Together, the Gaia and ground-based data will place new constraints on the demographics of BHs with metal-poor companions and test theoretical predictions linking low metallicity to the formation of the most massive stellar remnants.         |

|| A. L. Faisst, et al. -- incl., <mark>L. Xie</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-21*|
|*Comments*| *10 figures, 3 tables. Submitted to ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            We present the stellar mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and mass-metallicity-star formation relation ("fundamental metallicity relation"; FMR) of 18 massive (log(M/M$_\odot$) = 9.5-11) main-sequence galaxies at z~5 from the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST sample. This sample complements recent studies by JWST at up to two orders of magnitude lower stellar masses. The metallicities are derived using strong optical lines, and verified by temperature-based oxygen abundance measurements for five galaxies for which faint auroral lines are detected. We find little evolution at the massive end of the MZR between z~5 and cosmic noon at z~2, suggesting a fast metal enrichment at early times. The FMR at z=5 exhibits a 5x larger scatter (preferentially to lower metallicities) compared the local FMR relation. This scatter can be explained by a bursty star formation and the direct build-up of metals in early galaxies as well as differences in age and outflow efficiencies. Capitalizing on all available samples, we find that the observed MZR and FMR over three orders of stellar mass is generally in good agreement with results from cosmological simulation, although some underestimate the metal enrichment at low stellar masses. This may be due to too efficient metal-rich outflows. We show that the ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST galaxies likely joined the current FMR at z~10 and will evolve into massive (log(M/M$_\odot$)~11.4) galaxies with super-solar metallicities by z=0.         |

|| D. Chattopadhyay, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. El-Badry</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-21*|
|*Comments*| *to be submitted to ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            We model the evolution of 21 Gaia neutron star (NS)-main-sequence binaries (orbital period $P_{\mathrm{orb}}\sim200$--$1000$ days, eccentricity $e\gtrsim0.2$) using binary evolution with \texttt{MESA}. We examine eccentric mass transfer and models assuming prior circularization. All systems end as NS-white dwarf (WD) binaries, but transfer modes yield distinct outcomes. Under eccentric transfer, binaries are driven to higher $e$, forming orbits with $e\gtrsim0.6$ and $P_{\rm orb}\sim1000$-$4000$ days. Periastron bursts are brief ($\lesssim10^6$ yr), transfer only a few $\times10^{-2}$ M$_\odot$, and produce mildly recycled pulsars ($P_{\mathrm{spin}}\gtrsim50$ ms) with low-mass He WDs. Artificially circularized transfer gives $P_{\rm orb}\sim200$-$2000$ days, lasts $\sim10^7$ yr, and allows NSs to accrete $\sim0.1$ M$_\odot$, forming fully recycled MSPs ($P_{\mathrm{spin}}\sim$ few-30 ms) with CO WDs. Allowing super-Eddington accretion up to $100\times$ the canonical rate makes even eccentric systems efficient MSP producers, though torque coupling remains uncertain. Using an adaptive, field-dependent magnetic-field decay timescale, we find MSPs stay radio-active over Gyr spans. Gaia systems undergoing stable mass transfer remain wide and fail to match the Galactic MSP-WD population, where most, nearly circular systems have $P_{\rm orb}\lesssim100$ days. Binaries with different mass ratios and initial configurations -- likely leading to unstable mass transfer -- are needed to reproduce the observed MSP-WD distribution.         |

|| W.-P. Sun, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-21*|
|*Comments*| *15 pages, 4 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            The repeating behavior of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is regarded as a key clue to understanding their physical origin, yet reliably distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters with current observations remains challenging. Here we propose a physically interpretable and practically quantifiable classification framework based on spectral morphology. Using dimensionality reduction, clustering, and feature-importance analysis, we identify the spectral running $r$ and spectral index $\gamma$ as the most critical parameters for distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters in the CHIME/FRB sample. In the $\gamma$-$r$ space, repeaters preferentially occupy regions with steeper, narrower-band spectra, whereas non-repeaters cluster in flatter, broader-band regions, resulting in a clear density separation. We further construct an empirical probability map in the $\gamma$-$r$ space, showing a clear gradient of repetition likelihood, from $\sim 65\%$ in the high-repetition region to $\sim 5\%$ in the low-repetition region. Combining this with Gaussian Mixture Model posterior analysis, we identify several apparent non-repeaters with high inferred repetition probability, recommending them as priority targets for future monitoring. This framework provides a simple and generalizable tool for assessing repeatability in the CHIME/FRB sample and highlights the diagnostic power of spectral morphology in unveiling FRB origins.         |

|| Y. Huang, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-21*|

|**Abstract**|            There exist extremely massive spiral galaxies in isolated environments, with stellar masses several times that of the Milky Way, yet their star formation rates (SFRs) are comparable to or even lower than that of the Milky Way. In this paper, we investigate the molecular gas properties of such galaxies to better understand the origin of their low SFRs. We present IRAM 30m CO observations of five extremely massive spirals from the CGM-MASS sample. We compare their star formation efficiencies (SFEs) with the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and find that these massive spirals generally exhibit low efficiency in converting molecular gas into stars. We further compare their molecular gas masses with their atomic gas and stellar masses, and also include the CHANG-ES sample galaxies observed with the IRAM 30m telescope in a similar manner for comparison. Our sample galaxies show low efficiency in converting atomic to molecular gas and have lower molecular gas fractions, suggesting that their suppressed star formation stems from both limited gas supply and inefficient star formation. Considering potential cold gas sources in massive spirals, we argue that their current reservoirs likely originate from past starburst or merger events rather than ongoing accretion in present isolated environments. Finally, we examine the location of these galaxies on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, finding them baryon-deficient and deviating from the trend of lower-mass galaxies. This suggests either a significant undetected baryonic component or a flattening/turnover of the relation at the high-mass end, consistent with the stellar mass-halo mass relation.         |

|| D. Li, <mark>J. Li</mark>, H. Ji |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-21*|
|*Comments*| *accepted for publication in ApJS*|
|**Abstract**|            Decaying pulsations have been simultaneously detected in the low-energy X-rays of solar/stellar flares, which are supposed to be associated with standing slow magnetoacoustic or kink-mode waves. The physical mechanism behind rapidly decaying remains unknown. We present the detection of quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) with rapidly decaying in high-energy emissions produced in two major flares on 10 January and 14 May 2024. Using empirical mode decomposition, decaying QPPs are identified in hard X-ray and microwave emissions during the flare impulsive phase, suggesting a process of oscillatory magnetic reconnection. The quasi-periods and decay times are determined by a damped harmonic function, which are approximately 177$\pm$8 s (249$\pm$25 s) and 118$\pm$4 s (124$\pm$5 s), respectively. The restructured X-ray images reveal double footpoints connected by hot flare loops. Their phase speeds are estimated to about 400 km/s and 670 km/s, both below the local sound speed in high-temperature plasmas, indicating the presence of slow-mode waves in hot flare loops. We perform coronal diagnostics based on standing slow-mode waves and derive key physical parameters, including the polytropic index, the thermal ratio, viscous ratio and radiation ratio, which are consistent with previous results. Our observations support that the decaying QPPs are triggered by oscillatory magnetic reconnection that is modulated by standing slow magnetoacoustic waves, with their rapid decay attributable to a co-effect of viscous damping and localized magnetic reconnection rate.         |
