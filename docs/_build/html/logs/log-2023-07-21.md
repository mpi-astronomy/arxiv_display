|**Abstract**| We investigate the ionised gas morphology, excitation properties, and kinematics in 19 nearby star-forming galaxies from the PHANGS-MUSE survey. We directly compare the kinetic energy of expanding superbubbles and the turbulent motions in the interstellar medium with the mechanical energy deposited by massive stars in the form of winds and supernovae, with the aim to answer whether the stellar feedback is responsible for the observed turbulent motions and to quantify the fraction of mechanical energy retained in the superbubbles. Based on the distribution of the flux and velocity dispersion in the H$\alpha$ line, we select 1484 regions of locally elevated velocity dispersion ($\sigma$(H$\alpha$)>45 km/s), including at least 171 expanding superbubbles. We analyse these regions and relate their properties to those of the young stellar associations and star clusters identified in PHANGS-HST data. We find a good correlation between the kinetic energy of the ionised gas and the total mechanical energy input from supernovae and stellar winds from the stellar associations, with a typical efficiency of 10-20%. The contribution of mechanical energy by the supernovae alone is not sufficient to explain the measured kinetic energy of the ionised gas, which implies that pre-supernova feedback in the form of radiation/thermal pressure and winds is necessary. We find that the gas kinetic energy decreases with metallicity for our sample covering Z=0.5-1.0 Zsun, reflecting the lower impact of stellar feedback. For the sample of superbubbles, we find that about 40% of the young stellar associations are preferentially located in their rims. We also find a slightly higher (by ~15%) fraction of the youngest (1-2.5 Myr) stellar associations in the rims of the superbubbles than in the centres, and the opposite for older associations, which implies possible propagation or triggering of star formation. |

|**Abstract**| A search for time-directional coincidences of ultra-high-energy (UHE) photons above 10 EeV with gravitational wave (GW) events from the LIGO/Virgo runs O1 to O3 is conducted with the Pierre Auger Observatory. Due to the distinctive properties of photon interactions and to the background expected from hadronic showers, a subset of the most interesting GW events is selected based on their localization quality and distance. Time periods of 1000 s around and 1 day after the GW events are analyzed. No coincidences are observed. Upper limits on the UHE photon fluence from a GW event are derived that are typically at $\sim$7 MeV cm$^{-2}$ (time period 1000~s) and $\sim$35 MeV cm$^{-2}$ (time period 1 day). Due to the proximity of the binary neutron star merger GW170817, the energy of the source transferred into UHE photons above 40 EeV is constrained to be less than 20% of its total gravitational wave energy. These are the first limits on UHE photons from GW sources. |
