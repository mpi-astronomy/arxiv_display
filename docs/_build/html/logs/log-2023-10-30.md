|**Abstract**| Star formation in galaxies is regulated by turbulence, outflows, gas heating and cloud dispersal -- processes which depend sensitively on the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) into which supernovae (SNe) explode. Unfortunately, direct measurements of ISM environments around SNe remain scarce, as SNe are rare and often distant. Here we demonstrate a new approach: mapping the ISM around the massive stars that are soon to explode. This provides a much larger census of explosion sites than possible with only SNe, and allows comparison with sensitive, high-resolution maps of the atomic and molecular gas from the Jansky VLA and ALMA. In the well-resolved Local Group spiral M33, we specifically observe the environments of red supergiants (RSGs, progenitors of Type II SNe), Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs, tracing stars $>$30 M$_{\odot}$, and possibly future stripped-envelope SNe), and supernova remnants (SNRs, locations where SNe have exploded). We find that massive stars evolve not only in dense, molecular-dominated gas (with younger stars in denser gas), but also a substantial fraction ($\sim$45\% of WRs; higher for RSGs) evolve in lower-density, atomic-gas-dominated, inter-cloud media. We show that these measurements are consistent with expectations from different stellar-age tracer maps, and can be useful for validating SN feedback models in numerical simulations of galaxies. Along with the discovery of a 20-pc diameter molecular gas cavity around a WR, these findings re-emphasize the importance of pre-SN/correlated-SN feedback evacuating the dense gas around massive stars before explosion, and the need for high-resolution (down to pc-scale) surveys of the multi-phase ISM in nearby galaxies. |

|**Abstract**| We test whether we can predict optical spectra from deep-field photometry of distant galaxies. Our goal is to perform a comparison in data space, highlighting the differences between predicted and observed spectra. The Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) provides high-quality optical spectra of thousands of galaxies at redshift $0.6<z<1$. Broad-band photometry of the same galaxies, drawn from the recent COSMOS2020 catalog, is used to predict the optical spectra with the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code Prospector and the MILES stellar library. The observed and predicted spectra are compared in terms of two age and metallicity-sensitive absorption features (H$\delta_\mathrm{A}$ and Fe4383). The global bimodality of star-forming and quiescent galaxies in photometric space is recovered with the model spectra. But the presence of a systematic offset in the Fe4383 line strength and the weak correlation between the observed and modeled line strength imply that accurate age or metallicity determinations cannot be inferred from photometry alone. For now we caution that photometry-based estimates of stellar population properties are determined mostly by the modeling approach and not the physical properties of galaxies, even when using the highest-quality photometric datasets and state-of-the-art fitting techniques. When exploring a new physical parameter space (i.e. redshift or galaxy mass) high-quality spectroscopy is always needed to inform the analysis of photometry. |

|**Abstract**| The atmospheric dynamics of tidally-locked hot Jupiters is dominated by the equatorial winds. Understanding the interaction between global circulation and chemistry is crucial in atmospheric studies and interpreting observations. Two-dimensional (2D) photochemical transport models shed light on how the atmospheric composition depends on circulation. In this paper, we introduce the 2D photochemical transport model, VULCAN 2D, which improves on the pseudo-2D approaches by allowing for non-uniform zonal winds. We extensively validate our VULCAN 2D with analytical solutions and benchmark comparisons. Applications to HD 189733 b and HD 209458 b reveal distinct characteristics in horizontal transport-dominated and vertical mixing-dominated regimes. Motivated by the inferred carbon-rich atmosphere by Giacobbe et al. (2021), we find that HD 209458 b with super-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) exhibits pronounced C2H4 absorption on the morning limb but not on the evening limb, owing to horizontal transport from the nightside. We discuss when a pseudo-2D approach is a valid assumption and its inherent limitations. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of horizontal transport in transmission observations and its impact on the morning-evening limb asymmetry with synthetic spectra, highlighting the need to consider global transport when interpreting exoplanet atmospheres. |
