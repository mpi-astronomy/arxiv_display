|**Abstract**|            We carry out a shape and weak lensing analysis of Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) radio sources and Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) optical sources within the European Large Area Infrared Space Observatory Survey-North 1 (ELAIS-N1) field. Using HSC data alone, we detect a cosmic shear correlation signal at a significance of $\sim$$9\sigma$ over a $\sim$$6.4$ deg$^2$ region. For the radio dataset, we analyse observations from both the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) and the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT). While LoTSS provides the deepest radio imaging of ELAIS-N1 with a central source density of $\sim$2.7 arcmin$^{-2}$, its $6^{\prime\prime}$ resolution limits the accuracy of shape measurements. But, using LoTSS-matched HSC sources, we show that accurate radio shape measurements would enable us to measure the amplitude of the shear correlation function at least at $\sim$2$\sigma$ significance. In contrast, ILT observation of the field offers a superior $0.3^{\prime\prime}$ resolution. By cross-matching HSC and ILT samples, we measure a position angle correlation of $R_{\cos(2\alpha)} = 0.15 \pm 0.02$. This result highlights ILT's ability to resolve extended and diffuse emission. The current ILT observations lack the required depth for robust weak lensing measurements. To assess the potential of ILT, we use simulated data with increased observation hours. Our analysis indicates that with 3200 hours of ILT observations or deeper data, and assuming that statistical errors dominate over systematics, a shear correlation could be detected with moderate significance. To achieve this will require precise radio shear measurements and effective mitigation of point spread function (PSF) systematics.         |

|| C. Yang, et al. -- incl., <mark>M. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-06-27*|
|*Comments*| *17 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables. Accepted for publication in ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            We carry out deep imaging of the Milky Way satellite galaxies, Bootes III and Draco, with WFST as one pilot observing program to demonstrate the capability of WFST. Combining catalogs with PS1 DR2 and Gaia DR3, we derive proper motions for candidate member stars in these two satellite galaxies over a 12-year time baseline, yielding uncertainties of ~1.8 mas/yr at 21 mag and ~3.0 mas/yr at 22 mag in the r band. The proper motions derived from bright and faint stars are consistent, indicating no significant variation in proper motion across stellar luminosity as these galaxies undergo tidal interactions with the MW. Meanwhile, we suggest that Bootes III represents the bound remnant of the progenitor galaxy that gave rise to the Styx stream, as evidenced by its elongated density profile and overdensity in both spatial and kinematic space. This is the first paper to use WFST to measure the proper motions of faint stars in Milky Way satellite galaxies. More detailed analyses will be presented in forthcoming papers from the wide field survey (WFS) program.         |

|**Abstract**|            Star-forming galaxies in galaxy clusters play a crucial role in understanding the advanced stages of galaxy evolution within dense environments. We present a sample of 3.3$\mu$m PAH-bright galaxies in the Abell 2744 (A2744) galaxy cluster. Using F430M medium band images, we select PAH emitters in the galaxy cluster, which capture the 3.3$\mu$m PAH emission at the redshift of A2744. Our multi-wavelength study demonstrates consistent star formation rates (SFRs) derived from PAH emission and SED fitting, indicating the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH flux estimated from medium band image alone can reveal the entirety of star formation, immune to dust obscuration. We find that the PAH emitters are located in relatively low mass surface density regions of A2744, with SFRs aligning with the field star-forming main sequence at $z=0.3$. The PAH emission morphologies show more asymmetry than that of the F444W image when asymmetry index $> 0.4$. With these results, we suggest that these star-forming galaxies in A2744 are in the stage of falling into the cluster from the field, and have not been quenched yet. We further explore a potential link between these galaxies and cosmic filaments being accreted onto the cluster, which may channel gas inflows to fuel star formation. JWST medium-band imaging provides a powerful new tool for identifying heavily dust-obscured star-forming populations. Future HI and low-J CO observations should be prioritized to resolve the cold gas kinematics and star formation processes in these systems, which would directly test the role of environmental stripping versus filamentary gas supply.         |

|| C. Cheng, et al. -- incl., <mark>Y. Wang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-06-27*|
|*Comments*| *15 pages, 6 figures, AJ accepted*|
|**Abstract**|            We present first-light deep H$\alpha$ imaging taken with the Nanshan 1-meter wide-field telescope on the local galaxy NGC 4258, alongside archival data from Hubble Space telescope (HST), Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, and The Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. The H$\alpha$ image shows ongoing star formation not only inside the galaxy but also in an HI cloud in the eastern HI tail, which is roughly 16 kpc away from the main galaxy. The HST images reveal several ultra-blue compact objects ($\rm F555W - F814W <-0.5 mag,\, FWHM\sim 0.2''$) in the H$\alpha$ bright region, aligned with the HI tail, suggesting the presence of young open cluster candidate in the HI tail. Our results suggest that wide field H$\alpha$ imaging is a valuable tool for investigating recent star formation in the extended regions of NGC 4258. Furthermore, the star formation in diffuse HI tails could highlight an potential aspect of galaxy stellar halo formation, warranting further investigation of the impact of star formation in halos on galaxy evolution.         |
