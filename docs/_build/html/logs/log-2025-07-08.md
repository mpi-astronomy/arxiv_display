|**Abstract**|            We aim to deepen our understanding of the M-L transition on planetary-mass companions and isolated brown dwarfs, and search for evidence of possible differences between these two populations of objects. To this end, we present a set of 21 VLT/SINFONI K-band observations from five archival programs at a spectral resolution of 4000. We aim to measure atmospheric properties, such as temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity, to understand the similarities and differences between objects ranging from M5 to L5 in spectral type. We extracted the spectra of these targets with the TExTRIS code. Subsequently, we model them using ForMoSA, a Bayesian forward modeling tool for spectral analysis, exploring four families of self-consistent atmospheric models: ATMO, BT-Settl, Exo-REM, and Sonora. Here we present the spectra of our targets and the derived parameters from the atmospheric modeling. We observed a drop in effective temperature of more than 500 K as a function of spectral type at the M/L transition, likely related to limitations in the current atmospheric models. In addition, we report carbon-to-oxygen ratio measurements for three companions (2M 0103 AB b, AB Pic b, and CD-35 2722 b), which contribute to the growing list of exoplanets for which this value has been measured. In conclusion, the VLT/SINFONI Library highlights two key points. First, there is a critical need to further investigate the discrepancies among grids of spectra generated by self-consistent models, as these models yield varying results and do not uniformly explore the parameter space. Second, we do not observe apparent discrepancies in the K-band spectra between companions and isolated brown dwarfs, which potentially suggests that these super-Jupiter objects formed through a similar process; however, this warrants further investigation.         |

|**Abstract**|            Context. The dust and gas temperature in proto-planetary disks play critical roles in determining their chemical evolution and influencing planet formation processes. Aims. We attempted an accurate measurement of the dust and CO temperature profile in the edge-on disk of the Flying Saucer. Methods. We used the unique properties of the Flying Saucer, its edge-on geometry and its fortunate position in front of CO clouds with different brightness temperatures to provide independent constraints on the dust temperature. We compared it with the dust temperature derived using the radiative transfer code DiskFit and the CO gas temperature. Results. We find clear evidence for a substantial gas temperature vertical gradient, with a cold (10 K) disk mid-plane and a warmer CO layer where T(r) is 27 K at 100 au, dropping with exponent 0.3. Direct evidence for CO depletion in the mid-plane, below about 1 scale height, is also found. At this height, the gas temperature is 15-20 K, consistent with the expected CO freeze out temperature. The dust disk appears optically thin at 345 GHz, and exhibits moderate settling.         |

|**Abstract**|            The gravitational potential of the Milky Way encodes information about the distribution of all matter -- including dark matter -- throughout the Galaxy. Gaia data release 3 has revealed a complex structure that necessitates flexible models of the Galactic gravitational potential. We make use of a sample of 5.6 million upper-main-sequence stars to map the full 3D gravitational potential in a one-kiloparsec radius from the Sun using a data-driven approach called ``Deep Potential''. This method makes minimal assumptions about the dynamics of the Galaxy -- that the stars are a collisionless system that is statistically stationary in a rotating frame (with pattern speed to be determined). We model the distribution of stars in 6D phase space using a normalizing flow and the gravitational network using a neural network. We recover a local pattern speed of $\Omega_p = 28.2\pm0.1\mathrm{\,km/s/kpc}$, a local total matter density of $\rho=0.086\pm0.010\mathrm{\,M_\odot/pc^3}$ and local dark matter density of $\rho_\mathrm{DM}=0.007\pm0.011\mathrm{\,M_\odot/pc^3}$. The full 3D model exhibits spatial fluctuations, which may stem from the model architecture and non-stationarity in the Milky Way.         |

|**Abstract**|            Understanding how the dynamical state of the interstellar medium (ISM) changes across spatial scales can provide important insights into how the gas is organized and ultimately collapses to form stars. To this end, we present ALMA $^{12}\mathrm{CO}(2-1)$ observations at $7$ pc ($0.4''$) spatial resolution across a $1.4~\mathrm{kpc}\times5.6~\mathrm{kpc}$ ($1'.3\times1'.3$) region located in the disk of the nearby ($D = 3.5$ Mpc), massive, star-forming galaxy NGC 253. We decompose this emission with a hierarchical, multiscale dendrogram algorithm to identify 2463 structures with deconvolved sizes ranging from $\sim3$ to $300$ pc, complete to a limiting mass of $10^4~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. By comparing the virial parameter of these structures against physical properties including size, mass, surface density, velocity dispersion, and hierarchical position, we carry out a comprehensive search for a preferred scale at which gravitationally bound structures emerge. Ultimately, we do not identify any emergent scale for bound objects in our data, nor do we find a correlation between the virial parameter and structure sizes. These findings suggest that gravitational binding cannot be used to define molecular clouds and emphasize the need for multiscale approaches to characterize the ISM.         |

|**Abstract**|            The inner regions of the Milky Way are known to contain an enigmatic population of prominent molecular clouds characterised by extremely broad lines. The physical origin of these ''extended velocity features'' (EVFs) is still debated, although a connection with the ''dust lanes'' of the Galactic bar has been hypothesised. In this paper, we search for analogous features in the dust lanes of nearby barred galaxies using the PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) survey. We aim to confirm existence of EVFs in other galaxies and to take advantage of the external perspective to gain insight into their origin. We study a sample of 29 barred galaxies and find that 34% contain one or more EVFs, while the remaining lack obvious signs of EVFs. Upon analysing the physical properties of the EVFs, we find they possess large virial parameters, ranging from few hundreds to several thousand, indicating that they are strongly out-of-equilibrium. The most likely explanation for their origin is extreme cloud-cloud collisions with relative velocities in excess of 100km/s in highly non-circular flow driven by the bar. This interpretation is consistent with previous high-resolution observations in Milky Way. Further corroboration of this interpretation comes from the inspection of high-sensitivity infrared observations from the PHANGS-JWST Treasury Survey that reveals streams of gas that appear to be hitting the dust lanes at locations where EVFs are found. We argue that EVFs are the clearest examples of cloud-cloud collisions available in literature and represent a unique opportunity to study cloud collisions and their impact on star formation.         |

|*Comments*| *23 pages, 14 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            We examine scale and redshift dependence of mass-property relations (MPRs) for five hot gas properties of two large group- and cluster-scale halo samples realized by the IllustrisTNG, TNG-Cluster and FLAMINGO cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. For intrinsic properties of i) hot gas mass ($M_{\rm gas}$), ii) spectroscopic-like temperature ($T_{\rm sl}$), iii) soft-band X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$), and iv) X-ray ($Y_{\rm X}$) and v) Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ($Y_{\rm SZ}$) thermal energies, we use MPR parameters to infer mass proxy quality (MPQ) -- the implied scatter in total halo mass conditioned on a property -- for halos with $M_{\rm 500c} \geq 10^{13}{\, {\rm M}_\odot}$ at redshifts, $z \in \{0, 0.5, 1, 2\}$. We find: (1) in general, scaling relation slopes and covariance display moderate to strong dependence on halo mass, with redshift dependence secondary, (2) for halos with $M_{\rm 500c} > 10^{14}{\, {\rm M}_\odot}$, scalings of $M_{\rm gas}$ and $Y_{\rm SZ}$ simplify toward self-similar slope and constant intrinsic scatter (5 and 10%, respectively) nearly independent of scale, making both measures ideal for cluster finding and characterization to $z=2$, (3) halo mass-conditioned likelihoods of hot gas mass and thermal energy at fixed halo mass closely follow a log-normal form, (4) despite normalization differences ranging up to $0.4$ dex, there is good qualitative, and often quantitative, agreement between the scale-dependent slopes and property covariance of the two simulations. Slopes show appreciable redshift dependence at the group scale, while redshift dependence of the scatter is exhibited by low mass FLAMINGO halos only, (5) property correlations are largely consistent between the simulations, with values that mainly agree with existing empirical measurements. We close with a literature survey placing our MPR slopes and intrinsic scatter estimates into context.         |

|| Z. Lin, et al. -- incl., <mark>Y. Wang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-08*|
|*Comments*| *22 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, accepted by ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            We report unnoticed but intriguing features in the peculiar nuclear transient AT 2022fpx, and investigate its type. These features include the constantly red optical color of $g-r>0$, stable soft X-ray flare ($kT\sim100$ eV) in the past $\sim$550 days, prominent mid-infrared echo peaked at $\sim$$10^{43.3}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and the confirmation of a weak AGN by weak flares in pre-event WISE mid-infrared light curves with no contemporary optical, radio or X-ray counterparts. The combination of the optical red color and possible TDE origin of AT 2022fpx is particularly attractive, as it challenges the most widely accepted and adopted "blue color" criterion for optical TDE selection. Although we still cannot confirm whether the red color is intrinsic, we however find that the "blue color" criterion can filter out normal TDEs whose optical-UV spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are either severely contaminated by prominent emission lines (especially H$\alpha$) or heavily dust-reddened. Hence, its potential selection effect may have been imprinted on the whole optical TDE family. Blackbody fitting on the optical (rest-frame $\sim$$4000-7000$ Å) and optical-UV ($\sim$$2000-7000$ Å) SEDs of four TDEs with high-cadence UV observations shows that $T_\mathrm{bb}$ rise by $\sim$40$-$110 % when the UV bands are included. The power-law models ($f_{\lambda}\propto\lambda^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha=2-3$) can fit the rest-frame $\sim$$2000-7000$ Å SEDs more consistently, indicating that SEDs should peak at shorter wavelengths, but not simple blackbodies. Hence, the estimated released energy for the optical-UV bright but X-ray faint TDEs based on blackbody SED fitting should be significantly lower than the intrinsic energy.         |

|**Abstract**|            We analyze imaging from Data Preview 1 of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory to explore the performance of early LSST pipelines in the 47 Tucanae field. The coadd-\texttt{object} catalog demonstrates the depth and precision possible with Rubin, recovering well-defined color magnitude diagrams for 47 Tuc Small Magellanic Cloud. Unfortunately, the existing pipelines fail to recover sources within $\sim$28 pc of the cluster center, due to the extreme source density. Using Rubin's forced photometry on stars identified via Difference Imaging, we can recover sources down to $\sim$14 pc from the cluster center, and find 14744 potential cluster members with this extended dataset. While this forced photometry has significant systematics, our analysis showcases the potential for detailed structural studies of crowded fields with the Rubin Observatory.         |

|| R. Zhao, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-08*|
|*Comments*| *18 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) observations of the outbursting, Halley-type comet 12P/Pons-Brooks. Three NIR spectra were obtained during two outbursts in October and November 2023, with the 3-meter Infrared Telescope Facility and the Palomar 200-inch Telescope, respectively. The NIR spectra exhibited absorption features at 1.5 and 2.0 $\mu$m, consistent with the diagnostic absorption bands of water ice, superimposed on a red dust-scattering continuum. We find that the absorption bands and the red continuum can be well explained by micrometer-sized crystalline ice at 140--170 K, along with sub-micrometer-sized refractory grains (e.g., amorphous carbon). In addition, an optical spectrum was obtained with the Lijiang 2.4-meter Telescope during the November 2023 outburst, which exhibited the emission bands of gaseous CN, C$_3$, C$_2$ and NH$_2$. The C$_3$/CN and C$_2$/CN ratios suggest that 12P/Pons-Brooks was ''typical'' in C$_3$ abundance but somewhat depleted in C$_2$. The specific kinetic energy of the 2023 November outburst is estimated to be $\sim8\times10^3$ J kg$^{-1}$, suggesting a likely triggering mechanism similar to 332P/Ikeya--Murakami and 17P/Holmes, i.e., the crystallization of amorphous water ice. A refractory-to-ice ratio of $\sim$1.7--3.2 is derived from the total mass loss of dust and gas, aligning with the lower-end estimates for 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and 1P/Halley. This suggests either a less evolved nucleus or an outburst region enriched in icy materials relative to the bulk nucleus.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-08*|
|*Comments*| *34 pages*|
|**Abstract**|            As part of the SKYSURF Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Legacy Archival program we present galaxy number counts which yield measurements of the extragalactic background light (EBL) at 15 different wavelengths. We have processed 82,752 HST images across 23 filters into 16,686 mosaics using the same software and processing pipeline throughout. Using 17/23 filters that give reliable galaxy counts, we constrain the integrated galaxy light (IGL) with a 1.5-9\% error between 0.3 and 1.6 $\mu$m in combination with 8 bands from WAVES (Wide Area VISTA Extragalactic Survey) and DEVILS (Deep Extragalactic Visible Legacy Survey). While HST was never intended to undertake large area surveys, through extensive quality control and filtering, we were able to extract a reliable and representative sample of fields distributed across the sky. Our final catalogs cover a combined $\approx 19.6 °^2$, with individual filters covering areas ranging from $\approx 0.16-7.0 °^2$. The combination of numerous independent sight-lines and area coverage allows us to reduce cosmic variance uncertainties in deep number counts to 0.06\%-1.8\%. For the first time we are able to establish a measurement of the IGL, $\mathrm{9.07 \pm 0.35 nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}}$, at 0.59 $\mu$m using HST data. We obtain a cosmic optical background value of $ 24.45 \pm 0.50 \mathrm{nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}}$. Different techniques used to measure the COB, both directly and indirectly, have recently converged indicating that the COB arises almost exclusively from processes within galaxies. This in combination with the recent values reported from New Horizons and very high energy (VHE) constraints leaves very little room for any diffuse emission coming from outside the Milky Way.         |

|| G. Rodrigues, et al. -- incl., <mark>Y. Wang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-08*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            The large-scale structure survey J-PAS is taking data since October 2023. In this work, we present a forecast based on the Fisher matrix method to establish its sensitivity to the sum of the neutrino masses. We adapt the Fisher Galaxy Survey Code (FARO) to account for the neutrino mass under various configurations applied to galaxy clustering measurements. This approach allows us to test the sensitivity of J-PAS to the neutrino mass across different tracers, with and without non-linear corrections, and under varying sky coverage. We perform our forecast for two cosmological models: $\Lambda CDM + \sum m_\nu$ and $w_0w_a CDM + \sum m_\nu$. We combine our J-PAS forecast with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from the Planck Collaboration and Type Ia supernova (SN) data from Pantheon Plus. Our analysis shows that, for a sky coverage of 8,500 square degrees, J-PAS galaxy clustering data alone will constrain the sum of the neutrino masses to an upper limit of $\sum m_\nu < 0.32$\;eV for the $\Lambda CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model, and $\sum m_\nu < 0.36$\;eV for the $w_0w_a CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model. When combined with Planck data, the upper limit improves significantly. For J-PAS+Planck, we find $\sum m_\nu < 0.061$\;eV for the $\Lambda CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model, and for J-PAS+Planck+Pantheon Plus, we obtain $\sum m_\nu < 0.12$\;eV for the $w_0w_a CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model. These results demonstrate that J-PAS clustering measurements can play a crucial role in addressing challenges in the neutrino sector, including potential tensions between cosmological and terrestrial measurements of the neutrino mass, as well as in determining the mass ordering.         |

|| <mark>J. Shi</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-08*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            Planets in the liquid-water habitable zone of low-mass stars experience large tidal forces, $10^3$ to $10^4$ times those on Earth, due to the small distance between the habitable zone and the host stars. Therefore, interior solid tides, ocean tides and atmospheric tides on these planets could be much stronger than that on Earth, but rare work has been done to explicitly simulate the ocean tides. Here, for the first time, we perform global ocean tide simulations and show that ocean tides on asynchronously rotating planets with large eccentricities can reach $\mathcal{O}(1000)\,\mathrm{m}$ in height and $\mathcal{O}(10)\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}$ in flow speed. Interactions between tide and bottom topography can induce large energy dissipation, $\sim\mathcal{O}(100)\,\mathrm{W\,m^{-2}}$ in global mean. This tidal energy dissipation can strongly accelerate orbital evolution by 1-2 orders of magnitude. However, for planets with small eccentricities, the ocean tides are much weaker but still comparable to that on modern Earth. Our results suggest that ocean tides on eccentric planets orbiting low-mass stars are orders of magnitude more powerful than those on Earth and can dramatically influence surface geography and orbital evolution.         |

|| X. Chen, G. Liao, Q. Zheng, <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-08*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            In this manuscript, we propose, for the first time, an oversimplified but potentially effective gravitational acceleration model to interpret the double-peaked narrow emission lines (DPNELs) shifted in the same direction. We adopt the framework of a merging kpc-scale dual-core system in an elliptical orbit, which has an emission-line galaxy with clear narrow line regions (NLRs) merging with a companion galaxy lacking emission line features. Due to gravitational forces induced by both galaxies on the NLRs, the accelerations of the far-side and near-side NLR components may share the same vector direction when projected along the line-of-sight, leading the velocities of the observed DPNELs to shift in the same direction. Our simulations indicate that the probability of producing double-peaked features shifted in the same direction reaches 5.81% in merging kpc-scale dual core systems containing emission-line galaxies. Besides the expected results from our proposed model, we identify a unique galaxy SDSS J001050.52-103246.6, whose apparent DPNELs shifted in the same direction can be plausibly explained by the gravitational acceleration model. This proposed model provides a new path to explain DPNELs shifted in the same direction in the scenario that the two galaxies align along the line-of-sight in kpc-scale dual-core systems.         |

|**Abstract**|            The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) is a next-generation Stage-IV sky survey telescope, distinguished by its large field of view (FoV), high image quality, and multi-band observation capabilities. It can simultaneously conduct precise measurements of the Universe by performing multi-color photometric imaging and slitless spectroscopic surveys. The CSST is equipped with five scientific instruments, i.e. Multi-band Imaging and Slitless Spectroscopy Survey Camera (SC), Multi-Channel Imager (MCI), Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS), Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C), and THz Spectrometer (TS). Using these instruments, the CSST is expected to make significant contributions and discoveries across various astronomical fields, including cosmology, galaxy and active galactic nuclei (AGN), the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, stars, exoplanets, Solar System objects, astrometry, and transients and variable sources. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the CSST instruments, observational capabilities, data products, and scientific potential.         |
