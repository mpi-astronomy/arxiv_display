|**Abstract**| JWST is revealing a new population of dust-reddened broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) at redshifts $z\gtrsim5$. Here we present deep NIRSpec/Prism spectroscopy from the Cycle 1 Treasury program UNCOVER of 15 AGN candidates selected to be compact, with red continua in the rest-frame optical but with blue slopes in the UV. From NIRCam photometry alone, they could have been dominated by dusty star formation or AGN. Here we show that the majority of the compact red sources in UNCOVER are dust-reddened AGN: $60\%$ show definitive evidence for broad-line H$\alpha$ with FWHM$\, >2000$ km/s, for $20\%$ current data are inconclusive, and $20\%$ are brown dwarf stars. We propose an updated photometric criterion to select red $z>5$ AGN that excludes brown dwarfs and is expected to yield $>80\%$ AGN. Remarkably, among all $z_{\rm phot}>5$ galaxies with F277W$-$F444W$>1$ in UNCOVER at least $33\%$ are AGN regardless of compactness, climbing to at least $80\%$ AGN for sources with F277W$-$F444W$>1.6$. The confirmed AGN have black hole masses of $10^7-10^9$ M$_{\odot}$. While their UV-luminosities ($-16>M_{\rm UV}>-20$ AB mag) are low compared to UV-selected AGN at these epochs, consistent with percent-level scattered AGN light or low levels of unobscured star formation, the inferred bolometric luminosities are typical of $10^7-10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ black holes radiating at $\sim 10-40\%$ of Eddington. The number densities are surprisingly high at $\sim10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ mag$^{-1}$, 100 times more common than the faintest UV-selected quasars, while accounting for $\sim1\%$ of the UV-selected galaxies. While their UV-faintness suggest they may not contribute strongly to reionization, their ubiquity poses challenges to models of black hole growth. |

|**Abstract**| Deep MUSE observations have unveiled pervasive Ly$\alpha$ haloes (LAHs) surrounding high-redshift star-forming galaxies. However, the origin of the extended Ly$\alpha$ emission is still a subject of debate. We analyse the average spatial extent and spectral variation of the circumgalactic LAHs by stacking a sample of 155 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at redshift $3<z<4$ in the MUSE Extremely Deep Field (MXDF). With respect to the Ly$\alpha$ red peak of the target LAE, the Ly$\alpha$ line peak becomes increasingly more blueshifted out to a projected distance of at least 60 kpc, where the velocity offset is $\approx$ 250 km/s. This signal is observed in both the mean and median stacks, and is thus a generic property of the LAE sample with typical Ly$\alpha$ luminosity $\mathrm{\approx 10^{41.1} erg\,s^{-1}}$. We discuss multiple scenarios to explain the blueshift of the circumgalactic Ly$\alpha$ line. The most plausible one is a combination of outflows and inflows. In the inner region of the LAH, the Ly$\alpha$ photons are produced by the central star formation and then scattered within outflows. At larger radii, the infalling cool gas shapes the observed Ly$\alpha$ blueshift. |

|**Abstract**| We present MIRI/JWST medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS) and imaging (MIRIM) of the lensed galaxy MACS1149-JD1 at a redshift of $z$=9.1092$\pm$0.0002 (Universe age about 530 Myr). We detect, for the first time, spatially-resolved H$\alpha$ emission in a galaxy at redshift above 9. The structure of the H$\alpha$ emitting gas consists of two clumps, S and N. The total H$\alpha$ luminosity implies an instantaneous star formation rate of 5.3$\pm$0.4 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for solar metallicities. The ionizing photon production efficiency, $\log(\zeta_\mathrm{ion})$, shows a spatially-resolved structure with values of 25.55$\pm$0.03, 25.47$\pm$0.03, and 25.91$\pm$0.09 Hz erg$^{-1}$ for the integrated galaxy, and clumps S and N, respectively. The H$\alpha$ rest-frame equivalent width, EW$_{0}$(H$\alpha$), is 491$^{+334}_{-128}$ \'Angstrom for the integrated galaxy, but presents extreme values of 363$^{+187}_{-87}$ \'Angstrom and $\geq$1543 \'Angstrom for clumps S and N, respectively. The spatially-resolved ionizing photon production efficiency is within the range of values measured in galaxies at redshift above six, and well above the canonical value (25.2$\pm$0.1 Hz erg$^{-1}$). The extreme difference of EW$_{0}$(H$\alpha$) for Clumps S and N indicates the presence of a recent (few Myr old) burst in clump N and a star formation over a larger period of time (e.g. 100$-$200 Myr) in clump S. Finally, clump S and N show very different H$\alpha$ kinematics with velocity dispersions of 56$\pm$4 km s$^{-1}$ and 113$\pm$33 km s$^{-1}$, likely indicating the presence of outflows or increased turbulence in the clump N. The dynamical mass, $M_\mathrm{dyn}$= (2.4$\pm$0.5)$\times$10$^{9}$ $M_{\odot}$, is within the range previously measured with the spatially-resolved [OIII]88$\mu$m line. |

|**Abstract**| Operating since 2004, the Pierre Auger Observatory has led to major advances in our 8 understanding of the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The latest findings have revealed new insights 9 that led to the upgrade of the Observatory, with the primary goal of obtaining information on the 10 primary mass of the most energetic cosmic rays on a shower-by-shower basis. In the framework of the 11 upgrade, called AugerPrime, the 1660 water-Cherenkov detectors of the surface array are equipped 12 with plastic scintillators and radio antennas, allowing us to enhance the composition sensitivity. 13 To accommodate new detectors and to increase experimental capabilities, the electronics is also 14 upgraded. This includes better timing with up-to-date GPS receivers, higher sampling frequency, 15 increased dynamic range, and more powerful local processing of the data. In this paper, the design 16 characteristics of the new electronics and the enhanced dynamic range will be described. The 17 manufacturing and test processes will be outlined and the test results will be discussed. The 18 calibration of the SD detector and various performance parameters obtained from the analysis of 19 the first commissioning data will also be presented. |
