|**Abstract**|            We present spatially resolved ALMA observations of the water line at 183 GHz in the disk around the Herbig star HD 100546. The water vapor emission peaks at the inner edge of the warm dust cavity, located ~15 au from the central star. We attribute this to thermal desorption at the water snowline, shifted outward at the dust cavity wall directly heated by the intense radiation. This represents the first spatially resolved image of the water snowline using ALMA observations of the main water isotopologue in a protoplanetary disk. The water emission morphology peaking inside the first dust ring is consistent with previous ALMA detections of oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules in the disk, including thermally desorbed methanol. These findings signal that warm cavities of transition disks provide ideal targets to directly reconstruct the spatial distribution of water vapor and the snowline location with ALMA, and directly connect water vapor emission to ice desorption of complex organic species.         |

|**Abstract**|            Owing to hot and inflated envelopes that facilitate atmospheric studies, ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) have attracted much attention. Significant progress has been achieved, from enlarging the sample size to broadening the studies to encompass diverse stellar types and ages. Here, we present a transmission spectroscopy study of HAT-P-70b, an UHJ orbiting a young A-type star, through high-resolution observations with CARMENES at the 3.5m Calar Alto telescope. By using the line-by-line technique, we confirm the previous detections of Ha, Na I, and Ca II, report a new tentative detection of K I, and impose an upper limit on the He triplet absorption. Through cross-correlation analysis, we identify the Ca II and Fe I absorptions, both blue-shifted by approximately 5 km/s, indicating a day-to-night side atmospheric wind. Additionally, we find a new tentative detection of K I. We do not see any significant atmospheric molecular signal in the near-infrared data. Putting HAT-P-70b in the context of UHJs from the literature, it turns out that (1) Ha absorption is more common on gas giants orbiting stars younger than 1 Gyr, with a relative detection probability of $P_{\rm Age<1\,Gyr}({\rm Ha})/P_{\rm Age\geq1\,Gyr}({\rm Ha})\sim 3$; (2) any UHJ is likely to exhibit Fe I absorption if it has Ca II.         |

|**Abstract**|            A nascent magnetar, accompanying a gamma-ray burst (GRB) explosion, releases enormous rotational energy via magnetic dipole radiation. The energy loss rate of the magnetar is determined by the strength of the magnetic field at the pole. We investigated the effect of the magnetic inclination angle on the energy loss rate. The released energy is injected into the GRB jet and shapes the light curves of GRB afterglow. Different evolutionary approaches lead to different curves shapes.A shallow decay phase in GRB X-ray afterglow may result from energy injection from a magnetar with a fixed inclination angle. A two-plateau phase may result from a decreasing inclination angle scenario. In this study, we considered an increasing inclination angle scenario. The energy loss rate of the magnetar increases as the magnetic inclination angle grows. Our analysis reveals that as the lost rotational energy injected into the GRB jet increases, rebrightening phases occur in the GRB afterglows. The rebrightening features are slight and short-lived. The observed afterglow rebrightening of GRB 170822A and GRB 230414B can be well explained within our framework. Some GRB X-ray afterglows that exhibit slight and early rebrightenings may result from an increasing magnetic inclination angle of a nascent magnetar.         |

|| H. Zhou, et al. -- incl., <mark>Y. Wang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-12-09*|
|*Comments*| *26 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables*|
|**Abstract**|            EP241217a is an X-ray transient detected by the Einstein Probe (EP) lasting for about 100 seconds and without accompanying $\gamma$-ray detection. The optical spectroscopy reveals the redshift of EP241217a is 4.59. By combining the $\gamma$-ray upper limit provided by GECAM-C, there is a considerable possibility that EP241217a is a typical Type II gamma-ray burst (GRB), but it is fainter than the detection threshold of any available $\gamma$-ray monitors (i.e., $E_{\gamma,{\rm iso}}\lesssim10^{53}$ erg). The X-ray light curve exhibits a plateau lasting for $\sim5\times10^4$ seconds. However, the joint analysis with optical data suggests the presence of an achromatic bump peaking at $\sim3\times10^4$ s after the trigger, indicating the actual duration of the X-ray plateau may be significantly shorter than it appears. To interpret the achromatic bump, we adopt the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in a wind-like medium and encountering a rapid density enhancement of the circumburst medium, which is likely induced by the the interaction of the progenitor's stellar wind and the interstellar medium. However, this model cannot fully explain observed data, and some issues do exist, e.g., the observed spectrum is harder than the model prediction. Consequently, we conclude that the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in the wind-like medium cannot explain all observed features of EP241217a. In addition, some alternative models commonly invoked to explain X-ray plateaus are discussed, but there are more or less issues when they are applied to EP241217a. Therefore, further theoretical modeling is encouraged to explore the origin of EP241217a.         |

|| <mark>J. Li</mark>, C. Zhao |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-12-09*|
|*Comments*| *22 pages, 15 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            Topological analysis of galaxy distributions has gathered increasing attention in cosmology, as they are able to capture non-Gaussian features of large-scale structures (LSS) that are overlooked by conventional two-point clustering statistics. We utilize Betti curves, a summary statistic derived from persistent homology, to characterize the multiscale topological features of the LSS, including connected components, loops, and voids, as a complementary cosmological probe. Using halo catalogs from the \textsc{Quijote} suite, we construct Betti curves, assess their sensitivity to cosmological parameters, and train automated machine learning based emulators to model their dependence on cosmological parameters. Our Bayesian inference recovers unbiased estimation of cosmological parameters, notably $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, $\sigma_8$, and $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$, while validation on sub-box simulations confirms robustness against cosmic variance. We further investigate the impact of redshift-space distortions (RSD) on Betti curves and demonstrate that including RSD enhances sensitivity to growth-related parameters. By jointly analyzing Betti curves and the power spectrum, we achieve significantly tightened constraints than using power spectrum alone on parameters such as $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, $\sigma_8$, and $w$. These findings highlight Betti curves -- especially when combined with traditional two-point statistics -- as a promising, interpretable tool for future galaxy survey analyses.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Bustling Universe Radio Survey Telescope in Taiwan (BURSTT) is a new-generation wide-angle radio telescope specifically designed to survey Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), energetic millisecond-duration pulses of unknown extragalactic origin. To realize its scientific potential, which includes detecting approximately 50 FRBs per year and sub-arcsecond localization capability, the system is designed to perform real-time beamforming and pulse search over the \SI{60}{\degree} $\times$ \SI{120}{\degree} field of view. This paper provides a detailed account of the design, implementation, and performance validation of the BURSTT back-end System. The system employs an efficient multi-stage processing architecture: initial beamforming is executed on the Xilinx ZCU216 RF System-on-Chip (RFSoC) platform; data is then transferred to Intel Xeon servers, where AVX-512 and AMX instruction sets are utilized for the second stage of beamforming and channelization, achieving high computational efficiency to ensure real-time capability. A highly optimized \texttt{bonsai} de-dispersion algorithm performs a real-time pulse search and triggering across 256 beams, which, upon detection, issues commands to the distributed outrigger system to save voltage data for very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) precise localization. System performance has been validated through beamforming tests using bright radio sources and real-time detection of known pulsars, confirming the high fidelity of the signal processing pipeline.         |
