|**Abstract**| The launch of ${\it JWST}$ opens a new window for studying the connection between metal-line absorbers and galaxies at the end of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Previous studies have detected absorber-galaxy pairs in limited quantities through ground-based observations. To enhance our understanding of the relationship between absorbers and their host galaxies at $z>5$, we utilized the NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) to search for absorber-associated galaxies by detecting their rest-frame optical emission lines (e.g., [OIII] + H$\beta$). We report the discovery of a MgII-associated galaxy at $z=5.428$ using data from the ${\it JWST}$ ASPIRE program. The MgII absorber is detected on the spectrum of quasar J0305--3150 with a rest-frame equivalent width of 0.74$\mathring{A}$. The associated galaxy has an [OIII] luminosity of $10^{42.5}\ {\rm erg\ s^{-1}}$ with an impact parameter of 24.9 proper kiloparsecs (pkpc). The joint ${\it HST}$-${\it JWST}$ spectral energy distribution (SED) implies a stellar mass and star-formation rate of ${\rm M_* \approx 10^{8.8}}$ ${\rm M_{\odot}}$, ${\rm SFR}\approx 10\ {\rm M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}}$. Its [OIII] equivalent width and stellar mass are typical of [OIII] emitters at this redshift. Furthermore, connecting the outflow starting time to the SED-derived stellar age, the outflow velocity of this galaxy is $\sim300\ {\rm km\ s^{-1}}$, consistent with theoretical expectations. We identified six additional [OIII] emitters with impact parameters of up to $\sim300$ pkpc at similar redshifts ($|dv|<1000\ {\rm km\ s^{-1}}$). The observed number is consistent with that in cosmological simulations. This pilot study suggests that systematically investigating the absorber-galaxy connection within the ASPIRE program will provide insights into the metal-enrichment history in the early universe. |

|**Abstract**| We present a case study of HE 0040-1105, an unobscured radio-quiet AGN at a high accretion rate (Eddington ratio = 0.19+/-0.04). This particular AGN hosts an ionized gas outflow with the largest spatial offset from its nucleus compared to all other AGNs in the Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS). By combining multi-wavelength observations from VLT/MUSE, HST/WFC3, VLA, and EVN we probe the ionization conditions, gas kinematics, and radio emission from host galaxy scales to the central few pc. We detect four kinematically distinct components, one of which is a spatially unresolved AGN-driven outflow located within the central 500 pc, where it locally dominates the ISM conditions. Its velocity is too low to escape the host galaxy's gravitational potential, and maybe re-accreted onto the central black hole via chaotic cold accretion. We detect compact radio emission in HE 0040-1105,within the region covered by the outflow, varying on ~20 yr timescale. We show that neither AGN coronal emission nor star formation processes wholly explain the radio morphology/spectrum. The spatial alignment between the outflowing ionized gas and the radio continuum emission on 100 pc, scales is consistent with a weak jet morphology rather than diffuse radio emission produced by AGN winds. > 90% of the outflowing ionized gas emission originates from the central 100 pc, within which the ionizing luminosity of the outflow is comparable to the mechanical power of the radio jet. Although radio jets might primarily drive the outflow in HE 0040-1105,, radiation pressure from the AGN may contribute in this process. |

|**Abstract**| We present PopSED, a framework for population-level inference of galaxy properties from photometric data. Unlike the traditional approach of first analyzing individual galaxies and then combining the results to determine the physical properties of the entire galaxy population, we directly make the population distribution the inference objective. We train normalizing flows to approximate the population distribution by minimizing the Wasserstein distance between the synthetic photometry of the galaxy population and the observed data. We validate our method using mock observations and apply it to galaxies from the GAMA survey. PopSED reliably recovers the redshift and stellar mass distribution of $10^{5}$ galaxies using broadband photometry within $<1$ GPU-hour, being $10^{5-6}$ times faster than the traditional SED modeling method. From the population posterior we also recover the star-forming main sequence for GAMA galaxies at $z<0.1$. With the unprecedented number of galaxies in upcoming surveys, our method offers an efficient tool for studying galaxy evolution and deriving redshift distributions for cosmological analyses. |

|**Abstract**| HII region electron temperatures are a critical ingredient in metallicity determinations and recent observations reveal systematic variations in the temperatures measured using different ions. We present electron temperatures ($T_e$) measured using the optical auroral lines ([NII]$\lambda5756$, [OII]$\lambda\lambda7320,7330$, [SII]$\lambda\lambda4069,4076$, [OIII]$\lambda4363$, and [SIII]$\lambda6312$) for a sample of HII regions in seven nearby galaxies. We use observations from the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby Galaxies survey (PHANGS) obtained with integral field spectrographs on Keck (Keck Cosmic Web Imager; KCWI) and the Very Large Telescope (Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer; MUSE). We compare the different $T_e$ measurements with HII region and interstellar medium environmental properties such as electron density, ionization parameter, molecular gas velocity dispersion, and stellar association/cluster mass and age obtained from PHANGS. We find that the temperatures from [OII] and [SII] are likely over-estimated due to the presence of electron density inhomogeneities in HII regions. We observe that differences between [NII] and [SIII] temperatures are weakly correlated with stellar association mass and molecular gas velocity dispersion. We measure high [OIII] temperatures in a subset of regions with high molecular gas velocity dispersion and low ionization parameter, which may be explained by the presence of low-velocity shocks. Of all the temperatures considered, the $T_{\rm{e}}$--$T_{\rm{e}}$ between [NII] and [SIII] temperatures have the lowest observed scatter and generally follow predictions from photoionization modeling, which suggests that these tracers reflect HII region temperatures across the various ionization zones better than [OII], [SII], and [OIII]. |

|| M. Ballardini, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. Jahnke</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-10-02*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**| Primordial features, in particular oscillatory signals, imprinted in the primordial power spectrum of density perturbations represent a clear window of opportunity for detecting new physics at high-energy scales. Future spectroscopic and photometric measurements from the $Euclid$ space mission will provide unique constraints on the primordial power spectrum, thanks to the redshift coverage and high-accuracy measurement of nonlinear scales, thus allowing us to investigate deviations from the standard power-law primordial power spectrum. We consider two models with primordial undamped oscillations superimposed on the matter power spectrum, one linearly spaced in $k$-space the other logarithmically spaced in $k$-space. We forecast uncertainties applying a Fisher matrix method to spectroscopic galaxy clustering, weak lensing, photometric galaxy clustering, cross correlation between photometric probes, spectroscopic galaxy clustering bispectrum, CMB temperature and $E$-mode polarization, temperature-polarization cross correlation, and CMB weak lensing. We also study a nonlinear density reconstruction method to retrieve the oscillatory signals in the primordial power spectrum. We find the following percentage relative errors in the feature amplitude with $Euclid$ primary probes for the linear (logarithmic) feature model: 21% (22%) in the pessimistic settings and 18% (18%) in the optimistic settings at 68.3% confidence level (CL) using GC$_{\rm sp}$+WL+GC$_{\rm ph}$+XC. Combining all the sources of information explored expected from $Euclid$ in combination with future SO-like CMB experiment, we forecast ${\cal A}_{\rm lin} \simeq 0.010 \pm 0.001$ at 68.3% CL and ${\cal A}_{\rm log} \simeq 0.010 \pm 0.001$ for GC$_{\rm sp}$(PS rec + BS)+WL+GC$_{\rm ph}$+XC+SO-like both for the optimistic and pessimistic settings over the frequency range $(1,\,10^{2.1})$. |
