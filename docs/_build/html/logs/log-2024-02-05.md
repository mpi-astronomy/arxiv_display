|**Abstract**| We report the test results of several independent foreground-cleaning pipelines used in the Ali CMB Polarization Telescope experiment (AliCPT-1), a high-altitude CMB imager in the Northern hemisphere with thousands of detectors dedicated to the search for a primordial CMB polarization $B$-mode signature. Based on simulated data from 4 detector modules and a single season of observation, which we refer to as DC1 data, we employ different and independent pipelines to examine the robustness and effectiveness of the estimates on foreground parameters and the primordial $B$-mode detection. The foreground-cleaning strategies used in the pipelines include the parametric method of template fitting (TF) and the non-parametric methods of the constrained internal linear combination (cILC), the analytical blind separation (ABS), and the generalized least squares (GLS). We examine the impact of possible foreground residuals on the estimate of the CMB tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) for each pipeline by changing the contamination components in the simulated maps and varying the foreground models and sky patches for various tests. According to the DC1 data with the simulation input value $r_{\rm true}=0.023$, the foreground residual contamination levels in the TF/ABS/cILC/GLS pipelines are well within the corresponding statistical errors at the $2\sigma$ level. For a selected patch with relatively stronger foreground contamination, all of the proposed pipelines perform robustly in testing. Furthermore, by utilizing the tension estimator, which helps identify significant residual foreground contamination in the detection of the primordial $B$-mode signal by quantifying the discrepancy between various $r$ measurements, we conclude that the presence of small foreground residuals does not lead to any significant inconsistency in the estimation of $r$. |

|**Abstract**| Many quenched galaxies discovered in the early Universe by \textit{JWST} raise fundemental question s on when and how these galaxies became quiescent. Making use of the latest version of the semi-analytic model GAEA that provides good agreement with the observed quenched fractions up to $z\sim 3$, we make predictions for the expected fractions of quiescent galaxies up to $z\sim 7$ and analyze the main quenching mechanism. We find that in a simulated box of $685~{\rm Mpc}$ on a side, the first quenched massive ($M_{\star} \sim 10^{11} {\rm M}_{\odot}$), Milky Way mass, and low mass ($M_{\star} \sim 10^{9.5} {\rm M}_{\odot}$ ) galaxies appear at $z\sim 4.5$, $z\sim 6.2$, and before $z = 7$. Most quenched galaxies identified at early redshifts remain quenched for more than 1 Gyr. Independently of galaxy stellar mass, the dominant quenching mechanism at high redshift is accretion disk feedback (quasar winds) from a central massive black hole, which is triggered by mergers in massive and Milky Way mass galaxies, and by disk instabilities in low-mass galaxies. Environmental stripping become increasingly more important at lower redshift. |
