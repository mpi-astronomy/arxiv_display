|**Abstract**|            We aim to develop a new method to infer the sub-beam probability density function (PDF) of H2 column densities and the dense gas mass within molecular clouds using spatially unresolved observations of molecular emission lines in the 3 mm band. We model spatially unresolved line integrated intensity measurements as the average of an emission function weighted by the sub-beam column density PDF. The emission function, which expresses the line integrated intensity as a function of the gas column density, is an empirical fit to high resolution (< 0.05 pc) multi-line observations of the Orion B molecular cloud. The column density PDF is assumed to be parametric, composed of a lognormal distribution at moderate column densities and a power law distribution at higher column densities. To estimate the sub-beam column density PDF, the emission model is combined with a Bayesian inversion algorithm (the Beetroots code), which takes account of thermal noise and calibration errors. We validate our method by demonstrating that it recovers the true column density PDF of the Orion B cloud, reproducing the observed emission line integrated intensities. We apply the method to 12CO(J=1-0), 13CO(J=1-0), C18O(J=1-0), HCN(J=1-0), HCO+(J=1-0) and N2H+(J=1-0) observations of a 700 x 700 pc2 field of view (FoV) in the nearby galaxy M51. On average, the model reproduces the observed intensities within 30%. The column density PDFs obtained for the spiral arm region within our test FoV are dominated by a power-law tail at high column densities, with slopes that are consistent with gravitational collapse. Outside the spiral arm, the column density PDFs are predominantly lognormal, consistent with supersonic isothermal turbulence. We calculate the mass associated with the powerlaw tail of the column density PDFs and observe a strong, linear correlation between this mass and the 24$\mu$m surface brightness.         |

|**Abstract**|            This study evaluates the impact of Starlink satellites on low-frequency radio astronomy below 100 MHz, focusing on challenges on data processing and scientific goals. We conducted 40 hours of imaging observations using NenuFAR, in the 30.8-78.3 MHz range. Observations included both targeted tracking of specific satellites based on orbital predictions and untargeted searches focused on high-elevation regions of the sky. Images in total intensity and polarimetry were obtained, and full Stokes dynamic spectra were generated for several hundred directions within the Field of View. Detected signals were cross-matched with satellite orbital data to confirm satellite associations. Detailed analyses of the observed spectra, polarization, and temporal characteristics were performed to investigate the origin and properties of the detected emissions. We detected broadband emissions from Starlink satellites, predominantly between 54-66 MHz, with flux densities exceeding 500 Jy. These signals are highly polarized and unlikely to originate from ground-based RFI or reflected astronomical sources. Instead, they are likely intrinsic to the satellites, with distinct differences in emission properties observed between satellite generations. These findings highlight significant challenges to data processing and scientific discoveries at these low frequencies, emphasizing the need for effective mitigation strategies, particularly through collaboration between astronomers and satellite operators.         |
