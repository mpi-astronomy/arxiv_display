|**Abstract**|            NGC 253, the Sculptor galaxy, is the southern, massive, star-forming disk galaxy closest to the Milky Way. In this work, we present a new 103-pointing MUSE mosaic of this galaxy covering the majority of its star-forming disk up to 0.75xR25. With an area of ~20x5 arcmin2 (~20x5 kpc2, projected) and a physical resolution of ~15 pc, this mosaic constitutes one of the largest, highest physical resolution integral field spectroscopy surveys of any star-forming galaxy to date. Here, we exploit the mosaic to identify a sample of ~500 planetary nebulae (~20 times larger than in previous studies) to build the planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) and obtain a new estimate of the distance to NGC 253. The value obtained is 17% higher than estimates returned by other reliable measurements, mainly obtained via the top of the red giant branch method (TRGB). The PNLF also varies between the centre (r < 4 kpc) and the disk of the galaxy. The distance derived from the PNLF of the outer disk is comparable to that of the full sample, while the PNLF of the centre returns a distance ~0.9 Mpc larger. Our analysis suggests that extinction related to the dust-rich interstellar medium and edge-on view of the galaxy (the average E(B-V) across the disk is ~0.35 mag) plays a major role in explaining both the larger distance recovered from the full PNLF and the difference between the PNLFs in the centre and in the disk.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a kinematical study of the ionized and molecular gas in the central region (~7-14"~100-200pc) of the nearby radio galaxy Cen A. We used JWST/MIRI MRS 5-28$\mu$m observations taken as part of the MIR Characterization of Nearby Iconic galaxy Centers (MICONIC) of the MIRI EC. The two gas phases present contrasting morphologies and kinematics. The brightest emission from the ionized gas, traced with a range of IP lines ([Fe II] to [Ne VI]), is extended along the direction of the radio jet. We also detected emission from low IP emission lines and H$_2$ transitions in the galaxy disk. Both gas phases present rotational motions but also complex kinematics. The observations reveal several ionized gas kinematical features that are consistent with simulation predictions of a jet-driven bubble and outflow interacting with the galaxy ISM. These include broad components in the nuclear line profiles ($\sigma$~600km/s), high velocities (~ +1000, -1400km/s) confined within the nuclear region, velocities of hundreds of km/s in several directions in the central 2", and enhanced velocity dispersions perpendicular to the radio jet. Moreover, we find evidence of shock excitation in the nuclear region based on MIR line ratios. We compared the ionized gas mass outflow rate with Cen A's AGN luminosity and radio jet power and demonstrate that both mechanisms provide sufficient energy to launch the outflow. The noncircular motions observed in the H$_2$ lines can be reproduced with either a warped rotating disk model or a radial component. The latter might be to related to gas streamers detected in cold molecular gas. There is no clear indication of a fast nuclear H$_2$ outflow, only a weak blueshifted component. This could be due to a relatively low nuclear warm H$_2$ column density and/or the limited geometrical coupling of Cen A's inner radio jet with the circumnuclear disk of the galaxy.

|**Abstract**|            ASASSN-14ko is a periodically repeating nuclear transient. We conducted high-cadence, multiwavelength observations of this source, revealing several recurrent early bumps and rebrightenings in its UV/optical light curves. The energy released during these bumps and rebrightenings shows a diminishing trend in recent UV/optical outbursts, which we monitored through multiwavelength observations. These features can be ascribed to the interaction between stream debris and the expanded disk in the repeated partial tidal disruption event. The X-ray light curve exhibits an inverse pattern compared to the UV/optical bands, displaying sporadic outbursts. Furthermore, our observations demonstrate that the blackbody temperature and radius in each outburst increase with the UV/optical luminosity, and such evolution resembles that observed in X-ray quasiperiodic eruptions, whereas distinguishing it from typical tidal disruption events.         |

|| <mark>G. Rouill√©</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-06-19*|

|**Abstract**|            A recent study announced the detection of three bands in the ultraviolet emission spectra of more than a dozen comets, assigning two of them to pentacene (C$_{22}$H$_{14}$) and the third one to toluene (C$_7$H$_8$). The comparison of the spectra with the results of exploitable laboratorymeasurements on rare-gas-matrix-isolated pentacene and on jet-cooled toluene does not reveal elements that would justify the assignment, which is therefore unsubstantiated. The study also claimed the detection of an Fe II line in the gas of all but one comet. Yet, spectroscopic data on Fe II do not corroborate the attribution. Because spectroscopic measurements on the ultraviolet emission of pentacene in the gas phase are not available, this work also presents a synthetic spectrum of the S$_5$ $\rightarrow$ S$_0$ transition relevant to the wavelength range of the observations. Calculated using density functional theory and its time-dependent extension, the synthetic spectrum may facilitate the search for pentacene fluorescence in cometary spectra until laboratory measurements are accessible.         |
