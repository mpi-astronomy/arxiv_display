|**Abstract**| AF Lep A+b is a remarkable planetary system hosting a gas-giant planet that has the lowest dynamical mass among directly imaged exoplanets. We present an in-depth analysis of the atmospheric composition of the star and planet to probe the planet's formation pathway. Based on new high-resolution spectroscopy of AF Lep A, we measure a uniform set of stellar parameters and elemental abundances (e.g., [Fe/H] = $-0.27 \pm 0.31$ dex). The planet's dynamical mass ($2.8^{+0.6}_{-0.5}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$) and orbit are also refined using published radial velocities, relative astrometry, and absolute astrometry. We use petitRADTRANS to perform chemically-consistent atmospheric retrievals for AF Lep b. The radiative-convective equilibrium temperature profiles are incorporated as parameterized priors on the planet's thermal structure, leading to a robust characterization for cloudy self-luminous atmospheres. This novel approach is enabled by constraining the temperature-pressure profiles via the temperature gradient $(d\ln{T}/d\ln{P})$, a departure from previous studies that solely modeled the temperature. Through multiple retrievals performed on different portions of the $0.9-4.2$ $\mu$m spectrophotometry, along with different priors on the planet's mass and radius, we infer that AF Lep b likely possesses a metal-enriched atmosphere ([Fe/H] $> 1.0$ dex). AF Lep b's potential metal enrichment may be due to planetesimal accretion, giant impacts, and/or core erosion. The first process coincides with the debris disk in the system, which could be dynamically excited by AF Lep b and lead to planetesimal bombardment. Our analysis also determines $T_{\rm eff} \approx 800$ K, $\log{(g)} \approx 3.7$ dex, and the presence of silicate clouds and dis-equilibrium chemistry in the atmosphere. Straddling the L/T transition, AF Lep b is thus far the coldest exoplanet with suggested evidence of silicate clouds. |

|**Abstract**| We present results of dust continuum and [CII]$\,158\,{\rm \mu m}$ emission line observations of a remarkably UV-luminous ($M_{\rm UV}=-21.6$) galaxy at $z=10.603$: GN-z11. Using the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA), observations have been carried out over multiple observing cycles. We achieved a high sensitivity resulting in a $\lambda_{\rm rest}=160\,{\rm \mu m}$ continuum $1\,\sigma$ depth of $13.0\,\rm{\mu Jy/beam}$ and a [CII] emission line $1\,\sigma$ sensitivity of $31\,\rm{mJy/beam\,km/s}$ using $50\,\rm{km/s}$ binning with a $\sim 2\,{\rm arcsec}$ synthesized beam. Neither dust continuum nor [CII]$\,158\,{\rm \mu m}$ line emission are detected at the expected frequency of $\nu_{\rm [CII]} = 163.791\,\rm{GHz}$ and the sky location of GN-z11. The upper limits show that GN-z11 is neither luminous in $L_{\rm IR}$ nor $L_{\rm [CII]}$, with a dust mass $3\,\sigma$ limit of ${\rm log}(M_{\rm dust}/{\rm M_{\odot}}) < 6.5-6.9$ and with a [CII] based molecular gas mass $3\,\sigma$ limit of ${\rm log}(M_{\rm mol,[CII]}/{\rm M_{\odot}}) < 9.3$. Together with radiative transfer calculations, we also investigated the possible cause of the dust poor nature of the GN-z11 showed by the blue color in the UV continuum of GN-z11 ($\beta_{\rm UV}=-2.4$), and found that $\gtrsim3\times$ deeper observations are crucial to study dust production at very high-redshift. Nevertheless, our observations show the crucial role of deep mm/submm observations of very high redshift galaxies to constrain multiple phases in the interstellar medium. |

|**Abstract**| Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) is the most massive globular cluster of the Milky Way and has been the focus of many studies that reveal the complexity of its stellar populations and kinematics. However, most previous studies have used photometric and spectroscopic datasets with limited spatial or magnitude coverage, while we aim to investigate it having full spatial coverage out to its half-light radius and stars ranging from the main sequence to the tip of the red giant branch. This is the first paper in a new survey of $\omega$ Cen that combines uniform imaging and spectroscopic data out to its half-light radius to study its stellar populations, kinematics, and formation history. In this paper, we present an unprecedented MUSE spectroscopic dataset combining 87 new MUSE pointings with previous observations collected from guaranteed time observations. We extract spectra of more than 300,000 stars reaching more than two magnitudes below the main sequence turn-off. We use these spectra to derive metallicity and line-of-sight velocity measurements and determine robust uncertainties on these quantities using repeat measurements. Applying quality cuts we achieve signal-to-noise ratios of 16.47/73.51 and mean metallicity errors of 0.174/0.031 dex for the main sequence stars (18 mag $\rm < mag_{F625W}<$22 mag) and red giant branch stars (16 mag $<\rm mag_{F625W}<$10 mag), respectively. We correct the metallicities for atomic diffusion and identify foreground stars. This massive spectroscopic dataset will enable future studies that will transform our understanding of $\omega$ Cen, allowing us to investigate the stellar populations, ages, and kinematics in great detail. |

|**Abstract**| We present 5 deg^2 (~250 pc^2) HCN, HNC, HCO+, and CO J=1-0 maps of the Orion B GMC, complemented with existing wide-field [CI] 492 GHz maps, as well as new pointed observations of rotationally excited HCN, HNC, H13CN, and HN13C lines. We detect anomalous HCN J=1-0 hyperfine structure line emission almost everywhere in the cloud. About 70% of the total HCN J=1-0 luminosity arises from gas at A_V < 8 mag. The HCN/CO J=1-0 line intensity ratio shows a bimodal behavior with an inflection point at A_V < 3 mag typical of translucent gas and UV-illuminated cloud edges. We find that most of the HCN J=1-0 emission arises from extended gas with n(H2) < 10^4 cm^-3, even lower density gas if the ionization fraction is > 10^-5 and electron excitation dominates. This result explains the low-A_V branch of the HCN/CO J=1-0 intensity ratio distribution. Indeed, the highest HCN/CO ratios (~0.1) at A_V < 3 mag correspond to regions of high [CI] 492 GHz/CO J=1-0 intensity ratios (>1) characteristic of low-density PDRs. Enhanced FUV radiation favors the formation and excitation of HCN on large scales, not only in dense star-forming clumps. The low surface brightness HCN and HCO+ J=1-0 emission scale with I_FIR (a proxy of the stellar FUV radiation field) in a similar way. Together with CO J=1-0, these lines respond to increasing I_FIR up to G0~20. On the other hand, the bright HCN J=1-0 emission from dense gas in star-forming clumps weakly responds to I_FIR once the FUV radiation field becomes too intense (G0>1500). The different power law scalings (produced by different chemistries, densities, and line excitation regimes) in a single but spatially resolved GMC resemble the variety of Kennicutt-Schmidt law indexes found in galaxy averages. As a corollary for extragalactic studies, we conclude that high HCN/CO J=1-0 line intensity ratios do not always imply the presence of dense gas. |
