|**Abstract**| The legacy of NASA's K2 mission has provided hundreds of transiting exoplanets that can be revisited by new and future facilities for further characterization, with a particular focus on studying the atmospheres of these systems. However, the majority of K2-discovered exoplanets have typical uncertainties on future times of transit within the next decade of greater than four hours, making observations less practical for many upcoming facilities. Fortunately, NASA's Transiting exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission is reobserving most of the sky, providing the opportunity to update the ephemerides for $\sim$300 K2 systems. In the second paper of this series, we reanalyze 26 single-planet, K2-discovered systems that were observed in the TESS primary mission by globally fitting their K2 and TESS lightcurves (including extended mission data where available), along with any archival radial velocity measurements. As a result of the faintness of the K2 sample, 13 systems studied here do not have transits detectable by TESS. In those cases, we re-fit the K2 lightcurve and provide updated system parameters. For the 23 systems with $M_* \gtrsim 0.6 M_\odot$, we determine the host star parameters using a combination of Gaia parallaxes, Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fits, and MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST) stellar evolution models. Given the expectation of future TESS extended missions, efforts like the K2 & TESS Synergy project will ensure the accessibility of transiting planets for future characterization while leading to a self-consistent catalog of stellar and planetary parameters for future population efforts. |

|**Abstract**| Transition disks are protoplanetary disks with inner cavities possibly cleared by massive companions, which makes them prime targets to observe at high resolution to map their velocity structure. We present ALMA Band 6 dust and gas observations of the transition disk around RXJ1604.3-2130 A, known to feature nearly symmetric shadows in scattered light. We study the $^{12}$CO line channel maps and moment maps of the line of sight velocity and peak intensity. We fit a Keplerian model of the channel-by-channel emission to study line profile differences, and produce deprojected radial profiles for all velocity components. The $^{12}$CO emission shows a cavity inwards of $\sim$56 au and within the dust continuum ring at 81 au. The azimuthal brightness variations in the $^{12}$CO line and dust continuum are broadly aligned with the shadows detected in scattered light observations. We find a strong localized non-Keplerian feature towards the west within the continuum ring (at $R=41\pm 10$ au and $PA=280\pm 2 ^\circ$). A tightly wound spiral is also detected which extends over 300$^\circ$ in azimuth, possibly connected to the localized non-Keplerian feature. Finally, a bending of the iso-velocity contours within the gas cavity indicates a highly perturbed inner region, possibly related to the presence of a misaligned inner disk. While broadly aligned with the scattered light shadows, the localized non-Keplerian feature cannot be solely due to changes in temperature. Instead, we interpret the kinematical feature as tracing a massive companion located at the edge of the dust continuum ring. We speculate that the spiral is caused by buoyancy resonances driven by planet-disk-interactions. However, this potential planet at $\sim$41 au cannot explain the gas-depleted cavity, the low accretion rate and the misaligned inner disk, suggesting the presence of another companion closer-in. |

|**Abstract**| We use data from the 17th data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE 2) to contrast the chemical composition of the recently discovered Gaia Enceladus/Sausage system (GE/S) to those of ten Milky Way (MW) dwarf satellite galaxies: LMC, SMC, Bo\"otes I, Carina, Draco, Fornax, Sagittarius, Sculptor, Sextans and Ursa Minor. Our main focus is on the distributions of the stellar populations of those systems in the [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] and [Mg/Mn]-[Al/Fe] planes, which are commonly employed in the literature for chemical diagnosis and where dwarf galaxies can be distinguished from in situ populations. We show that, unlike MW satellites, a GE/S sample defined purely on the basis of orbital parameters falls almost entirely within the locus of "accreted" stellar populations in chemical space, which is likely caused by an early quenching of star formation in GE/S. Due to a more protracted history of star formation, stars in the metal-rich end of the MW satellite populations are characterized by lower [Mg/Mn] than those of their GE/S counterparts. The chemical compositions of GE/S stars are consistent with a higher early star formation rate than MW satellites of comparable and even higher mass, suggesting that star formation in the early universe was strongly influenced by other parameters in addition to mass. We find that the direction of the metallicity gradient in the [Mg/Mn]-[Al/Fe] plane of dwarf galaxies is an indicator of the early star formation rate of the system |

|| Tianhuan Lu, Zoltán Haiman, <mark>Xiangchong Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-01-05*|
|*Comments*| *22 pages, 14 figures*|
|**Abstract**| We present cosmological constraints from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) first-year weak lensing shear catalogue using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and conventional summary statistics. We crop 19 $3\times3\,\mathrm{{deg}^2}$ sub-fields from the first-year area, divide the galaxies with redshift $0.3\le z\le1.5$ into four equally-spaced redshift bins, and perform tomographic analyses. We develop a pipeline to generate simulated convergence maps from cosmological $N$-body simulations, where we account for effects such as intrinsic alignments (IAs), baryons, photometric redshift errors, and point spread function errors, to match characteristics of the real catalogue. We train CNNs that can predict the underlying parameters from the simulated maps, and we use them to construct likelihood functions for Bayesian analyses. In the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model with two free cosmological parameters $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and $\sigma_8$, we find $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.278_{-0.035}^{+0.037}$, $S_8\equiv(\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3)^{0.5}\sigma_8=0.793_{-0.018}^{+0.017}$, and the IA amplitude $A_\mathrm{IA}=0.20_{-0.58}^{+0.55}$. In a model with four additional free baryonic parameters, we find $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.268_{-0.036}^{+0.040}$, $S_8=0.819_{-0.024}^{+0.034}$, and $A_\mathrm{IA}=-0.16_{-0.58}^{+0.59}$, with the baryonic parameters not being well-constrained. We also find that statistical uncertainties of the parameters by the CNNs are smaller than those from the power spectrum (5--24 percent smaller for $S_8$ and a factor of 2.5--3.0 smaller for $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$), showing the effectiveness of CNNs for uncovering additional cosmological information from the HSC data. With baryons, the $S_8$ discrepancy between HSC first-year data and Planck 2018 is reduced from $\sim2.2\,\sigma$ to $0.3\text{--}0.5\,\sigma$. |

|**Abstract**| Which galaxies in the general population turn into active galactic nuclei (AGN) is a keystone of galaxy formation and evolution. Thanks to SRG/eROSITA's contiguous 140 square degrees pilot survey field, we constructed a large, complete, and unbiased soft X-ray flux-limited AGN sample at low redshift $0.05<z<0.55$. Two summary statistics, the clustering using spectra from SDSS-V and galaxy-galaxy lensing with imaging from HSC, are measured and interpreted with halo occupation distribution and abundance matching models. Both models successfully account for the observations. We obtain an exceptional complete view of the AGN halo occupation distribution. The population of AGN is broadly distributed among halos with a mean mass of $3.9 _{- 2.4 }^{+ 2.0 }\times10^{12}M_\odot$. This corresponds to a large-scale halo bias of $b(z=0.34)= 0.99 ^{+0.08}_{-0.10}$. The central occupation has a large transition parameter $\sigma_{\log_{10}(M)}=1.28\pm0.2$. The satellite occupation distribution is characterized by a shallow slope $\alpha_{{\rm sat}}=0.73\pm0.38$. We find that AGNs in satellites are rare, with $f_{{\rm sat}}<20\%$. Most soft X-ray-selected AGNs are hosted by central galaxies in their dark matter halo. A weak correlation between soft X-ray luminosity and large-scale halo bias is confirmed (3.3$\sigma$). We discuss the implications of environmental-dependent AGN triggering. This study paves the way towards fully charting, in the coming decade, the co-evolution of X-ray AGN, their host galaxies, and dark matter haloes by combining eROSITA with SDSS-V, 4MOST, DESI, LSST, and Euclid. |

|**Abstract**| Despite their importance in stellar evolution, little is known about magnetic fields in the interior of stars. The recent seismic detection of magnetic fields in the core of several red giant stars has given measurements of their strength and information on their topology. We revisit the puzzling case of hydrogen-shell burning giants that show deviations from the expected regular period spacing of gravity modes. These stars also tend to have a too low measured period spacing compared to their counterparts. We here show that these two features are well accounted for by strong magnetic fields in the cores of these stars. For 11 Kepler red giants showing these anomalies, we place lower limits on the core field strengths ranging from 40 to 610 kG. For one star, the measured field exceeds the critical field above which gravity waves no longer propagate in the core. We find that this star shows mixed mode suppression at low frequency, which further suggests that this phenomenon might be related to strong core magnetic fields. |

|**Abstract**| Owing to their quiet evolutionary histories, nearby dwarf galaxies (stellar masses $M_\star \lesssim 3 \times 10^9 M_\odot$) have the potential to teach us about the mechanism(s) that 'seeded' the growth of supermassive black holes, and also how the first stellar mass black holes formed and interacted with their environments. Here, we present high spatial-resolution observations of three dwarf galaxies in the X-ray (Chandra), the optical/near-infrared (Hubble Space Telescope), and the radio (Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array). These three galaxies were previously identified as hosting candidate active galactic nuclei on the basis of lower resolution X-ray imaging. With our new observations, we find that X-ray sources in two galaxies (SDSS J121326.01+543631.6 and SDSS J122111.29+173819.1) are off nuclear and lack corresponding radio emission, implying they are likely luminous X-ray binaries. The third galaxy (Mrk 1434) contains two X-ray sources (each with $L_{\rm X} \approx 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$) separated by 2".8, has a low metallicity (12 + log (O/H) = 7.8), and emits nebular \ion{He}{II} $\lambda$4686 line emission. The northern source has spatially coincident point-like radio emission at 9.0 GHz and extended radio emission at 5.5 GHz. We discuss X-ray binary interpretations (where an ultraluminous X-ray source blows a 'radio bubble') and active galactic nucleus interpretations (where a $\approx 4\times10^5 M_\odot$ black hole launches a jet). In either case, we find that the \ion{He}{II} emission cannot be photoionised by the X-ray source, unless the source was $\approx$30-90 times more luminous several hundred years ago. |

|**Abstract**| Context. Deep spectroscopic surveys with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) have revealed that some of the brightest infrared sources in the sky correspond to concentrations of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFG) at high redshift. Among these, the SPT2349-56 protocluster system at z = 4.304 is amongst the most extreme examples due to its high source density and integrated star formation rate. Aims. We conducted a deep Lyman-$\alpha$ line emission survey around SPT2349-56 using the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at Very Large Telescope (VLT) in order to characterize this uniquely dense environment. Methods. Taking advantage of the deep three-dimensional nature of this survey, we performed a sensitive search for Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) toward the core and northern extension of the protocluster, which correspond to the brightest infrared regions in this field. Using a smoothed narrowband image extracted from the MUSE datacube around the protocluster redshift, we searched for possible extended structures. Results. We identify only three LAEs at z = 4.3 in this field, in concordance with expectations for blank-fields, and an extended Lyman-$\alpha$ structure spatially associated with core of the protocluster. All the previously-identified DSFGs in this field are undetected in Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, consistent with the conspicuous dust obscuration in these systems. We find an extended Lyman-$\alpha$ structure, about $60 \times 60$ kpc$^{2}$ in size, and located 56 kpc west of the protocluster core. Three DSFGs coincide spatially with the location of this structure. We conclude that either the three co-spatial DSFGs or the protocluster core itself are feeding ionizing photons to the Lyman-$\alpha$ structure. |

|**Abstract**| We present a retrospective analysis of Earth-based mid-infrared observations of Jupiter capturing the aftermath of the impacts by Comet D/Shoemaker-Levy 9 (henceforth SL9) in July 1994 and the Wesley impactor in July 2009. While the atmospheric effects of both impacts have been reported previously, we were motivated to re-examine both events using consistent methods to enable robust, quantitative comparisons. We analyzed spectrophotometry and spectroscopy capturing both impacts using two independent analyses: 1) a least-squares search over a grid of candidate mineral species to determine the composition of impact residue and 2) a radiative transfer analysis to derive atmospheric information. We observe that the SL9 impact sites are enhanced in stratospheric CH4 emissions at 7.9 um, due to shock heating and adiabatic compression from plume re-entry, and from 8.5 - 11.5 um due to stratospheric NH3 emission and non-gaseous cometary material. We derive NH3 concentrations of 5.7 ppmv at 30 mbar. In new findings, we find that the SL9 impact sites also exhibit a non-gaseous emission feature at 18 - 19 um. The non-gaseous emission at 8.5 - 11.5 and 18 - 19 um emission is best reproduced by predominantly amorphous olivine and obsidian at similar abundances. The Wesley impact site exhibits enhanced emissions from 8.8 - 11.5 and 18 - 19 um. We found this could be reproduced by predominantly amorphous olivine and stratospheric NH3 at concentrations of 150 ppbv at 30 mbar. Stratospheric NH3 abundances are a factor of 40 higher in the SL9 impacts compared to the Wesley impact, which confirms the former reached deeper, NH3-richer altitudes of the atmosphere. The absence of silicas in the Wesley impact would place an upper limit of 10 km/s on the incident velocity and 9 degree on the entry angle of the impactor such that temperatures were insufficient to convert silicates. |

|**Abstract**| With data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we showcase improvements to the MIT Quick-Look Pipeline (QLP) through the discovery and validation of a multi-planet system around M-dwarf TOI 4342 ($T_{mag}=11.032$, $M_* = 0.63 M_\odot$, $R_* = 0.60 R_\odot$, $T_{eff} = 3900$ K, $d = 61.54$ pc). With updates to QLP, including a new multi-planet search, as well as faster cadence data from TESS' First Extended Mission, we discovered two sub-Neptunes ($R_b = 2.266_{-0.038}^{+0.038} R_\oplus$ and $R_c = 2.415_{-0.040}^{+0.043} R_\oplus$; $P_b$ = 5.538 days and $P_c$ = 10.689 days) and validated them with ground-based photometry, spectra, and speckle imaging. Both planets notably have high transmission spectroscopy metrics (TSMs) of 36 and 32, making TOI 4342 one of the best systems for comparative atmospheric studies. This system demonstrates how improvements to QLP, along with faster cadence Full-Frame Images (FFIs), can lead to the discovery of new multi-planet systems. |

|**Abstract**| The Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) is a polarization-sensitive telescope array located at an altitude of 5,200 m in the Chilean Atacama Desert and designed to measure the polarized Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) over large angular scales. The CLASS array is currently observing with three telescopes covering four frequency bands: one at 40 GHz (Q); one at 90 GHz (W1); and one dichroic system at 150/220 GHz (HF). During the austral winter of 2022, we upgraded the first 90 GHz telescope (W1) by replacing four of the seven focal plane modules. These new modules contain detector wafers with an updated design, aimed at improving the optical efficiency and detector stability. We present a description of the design changes and measurements of on-sky optical efficiencies derived from observations of Jupiter. |

|**Abstract**| Binary systems are a well-established subclass of gamma-ray sources. The high mass X-ray binary pulsar 1A~0535+262 has been considered to be a possible gamma-ray emitter for a long time, although former gamma-ray searches using \textit{Fermi}-LAT and VERITAS data resulted in upper limits only. We aim at a deep search for gamma-ray emission and pulsations from 1A~0535+262 using more than 13 years of \textit{Fermi}-LAT data. The analysis was performed for both the whole \textit{Fermi}-LAT data set, as well as for the X-ray outbursts that 1A~0535+262 has experienced since the launch of \textit{Fermi}. Various X-ray observations have been used to generate the ephemeris for the pulsation search. We also investigate the long-term gamma-ray flux variability and perform orbital phase-resolved analysis for the outbursts. We did not detect any steady or pulsed gamma-ray emission from 1A~0535+262 during the whole \textit{Fermi}-LAT mission span or its X-ray outbursts. We thus derived the deepest gamma-ray luminosity upper limits to date at the 95\% confidence level to be around (2.3$-$4.7)$\times 10^{32}\, \rm erg \, s^{-1}$ depending on different spectral indices assumed, which results in a ratio of $L_{\rm \gamma}$ to $L_{\rm X}$ (2$-$150 keV) being (1.9$-$3.9)$\times10^{-6}$. |

|**Abstract**| Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are highly dispersed millisecond-duration radio bursts, of which the physical origin is still not fully understood. FRB 20201124A is one of the most actively repeating FRBs. In this paper, we present the collection of 1863 burst dynamic spectra of FRB 20201124A measured with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The current collection, taken from the observation during the FRB active phase from April to June 2021, is the largest burst sample detected in any FRB so far. The standard PSRFITs format is adopted, including dynamic spectra of the burst, and the time information of the dynamic spectra, in addition, mask files help readers to identify the pulse positions are also provided. |

|**Abstract**| Core collapse supernovae are thought to be one of the main sources in the galaxy of elements heavier than iron. Understanding the origin of the elements is thus tightly linked to our understanding of the explosion mechanism of supernovae and supernova nucleosynthesis. X-ray and gamma-ray observations of young supernova remnants, combined with improved theoretical modeling, have resulted in enormous improvements in our knowledge of these events. The isotope ${}^{44}$Ti is one of the most sensitive probes of the innermost regions of the core collapse engine, and its spatial and velocity distribution are key observables. Hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) has provided new insights into the structure of the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A), establishing the convective nature of the supernova engine. However, many questions about the details of this engine remain. We present here the concept for a balloon-borne follow-up mission called ASCENT (A SuperConducting ENergetic x-ray Telescope). ASCENT uses transition edge sensor gamma-ray microcalorimeter detectors with a demonstrated 55 eV Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) energy resolution at 97 keV. This 8--16-fold improvement in energy resolution over NuSTAR will allow high resolution imaging and spectroscopy of the ${}^{44}$Ti emission. This will allow a detailed reconstruction of gamma-ray line redshifts, widths, and shapes, allowing us to address questions such as: What is the source of the neutron star "kicks"? What is the dominant production pathway for ${}^{44}$Ti? Is the engine of Cas A unique? |

|**Abstract**| The prediction of solar flares is of practical and scientific interest; however, many machine learning methods used for this prediction task do not provide the physical explanations behind a model's performance. We made use of two recently developed explainable artificial intelligence techniques called gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) and expected gradients (EG) to reveal the decision-making process behind a high-performance neural network that has been trained to distinguish between MgII spectra derived from flaring and nonflaring active regions, a fact that can be applied to the task of short timescale flare forecasting. The two techniques generate visual explanations (heatmaps) that can be projected back onto the spectra, allowing for the identification of features that are strongly associated with precursory flare activity. We automated the search for explainable interpretations on the level of individual wavelengths, and provide multiple examples of flare prediction using IRIS spectral data, finding that prediction scores in general increase before flare onset. Large IRIS rasters that cover a significant portion of the active region and coincide with small preflare brightenings both in IRIS and SDO/AIA images tend to lead to better forecasts. The models reveal that MgII triplet emission, flows, as well as broad and highly asymmetric spectra are all important for the task of flare prediction. Additionally, we find that intensity is only weakly correlated to a spectrum's prediction score, meaning that low intensity spectra can still be of great importance for the flare prediction task, and that $78$% of the time, the position of the model's maximum attention along the slit during the preflare phase is predictive of the location of the flare's maximum UV emission |

|**Abstract**| Context. Apertif is a multi-beam receiver system for the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope that operates at 1.1-1.5 GHz, which overlaps with various radio services, resulting in contamination of astronomical signals with radio-frequency interference (RFI). Aims. We analyze approaches to mitigate Apertif interference and design an automated detection procedure for its imaging mode. Using this approach, we present long-term RFI detection results of over 300 Apertif observations. Methods. Our approach is based on the AOFlagger detection approach. We introduce several new features, including ways to deal with ranges of invalid data (e.g. caused by shadowing) in both the SumThreshold and scale-invariant rank operator steps; pre-calibration bandpass calibration; auto-correlation flagging; and HI flagging avoidance. These methods are implemented in a new framework that uses the Lua language for scripting, which is new in AOFlagger version 3. Results. Our approach removes RFI fully automatically, and is robust and effective enough for further calibration and (continuum) imaging of these data. Analysis of 304 observations show an average of 11.1% of lost data due to RFI with a large spread. We observe 14.6% RFI in auto-correlations. Computationally, AOFlagger achieves a throughput of 370 MB/s on a single computing node. Compared to published machine learning results, the method is one to two orders of magnitude faster. |

|**Abstract**| ERIS (Enhanced Resolution Imager and Spectrograph) is a new adaptive optics instrument installed at the Cassegrain focus of the VLT-UT4 telescope at the Paranal Observatory in Chile. ERIS consists of two near-infrared instruments: SPIFFIER, an integral field unit (IFU) spectrograph covering J to K bands, and NIX, an imager covering J to M bands. ERIS has an adaptive optics system able to work with both LGS and NGS. The Assembly Integration Verification (AIV) phase of ERIS at the Paranal Observatory was carried out starting in December 2021, followed by several commissioning runs in 2022. This contribution will describe the first preliminary results of the on-sky performance of ERIS during its commissioning and the future perspectives based on the preliminary scientific results. |

|**Abstract**| The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) light curve repository (LCR) is a publicly available, continually updated library of gamma-ray light curves of variable Fermi-LAT sources generated over multiple timescales. The Fermi-LAT LCR aims to provide publication-quality light curves binned on timescales of 3 days, 7 days, and 30 days for 1525 sources deemed variable in the source catalog of the first 10 years of Fermi-LAT observations. The repository consists of light curves generated through full likelihood analyses that model the sources and the surrounding region, providing fluxes and photon indices for each time bin. The LCR is intended as a resource for the time-domain and multi-messenger communities by allowing users to quickly search LAT data to identify correlated variability and flaring emission episodes from gamma-ray sources. We describe the sample selection and analysis employed by the LCR and provide an overview of the associated data access portal. |

|**Abstract**| Birth environments of young stars have strong imprints on the star itself and their surroundings. We present a detailed analysis of the wealthy circumstellar environment around the young Herbig Ae/Be star TCrA. Our aim is to understand the nature of the stellar system and the extended circumstellar structures as seen in scattered light images. We conduct our analysis combining archival data, and new adaptive optics high-contrast and high-resolution images. The scattered light images reveal the presence of a complex environment composed of a bright forward scattering rim of the disk's surface that is seen at very high inclination, a dark lane of the disk midplane, bipolar outflows, and streamer features likely tracing infalling material from the surrounding birth cloud onto the disk. The analysis of the light curve suggests the star is a binary with a period of 29.6yrs. The comparison of the scattered light images with ALMA continuum and 12CO line emission shows the disk is in keplerian rotation, with the northern side of the outflowing material receding, while the southern side approaching the observer. The disk is itself seen edge-on. The direction of the outflows seen in scattered light is in agreement with the direction of the more distant molecular hydrogen emission-line objects (MHOs) associated to the star. Modeling of the SED using a radiative transfer scheme well agrees with the proposed configuration, as well as the hydrodynamical simulation performed using a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code. We find evidence of streamers of accreting material around TCrA. These streamers connect the filament along which TCrA is forming with the outer parts of the disk, suggesting that the strong misalignment between the inner and outer disk is due to a change in the direction of the angular momentum of the material accreting on the disk during the late phase of star formation. |

|*Appeared on*| *2023-01-05*|

|**Abstract**| The formation of silicates in circumstellar envelopes of stars evolving through the AGB is still debated given the uncertainties affecting stellar evolution modelling, the description of the dust formation process, and the capability of silicate grains to accelerate stellar outflows via radiation pressure. We study the formation of dust in the winds of intermediate mass (M $\geq 4 M_{\odot}$) stars of solar metallicity while evolving through the AGB phase. We tested the different treatments of the mass-loss mechanism by this class of stars, with the aim of assessing their contribution to the general enrichment of silicates of the interstellar medium of galaxies. We consider a sub-sample of AGB stars, whose SED is characterised by deep absorption features at $10$ and $18\mu$m, which can be regarded as the class of stars providing the most relevant contribution to the silicates' production across the Universe. Results from stellar evolution and dust formation modelling were used to fit the observed SED and to reproduce, at the same time, the detected pulsation periods and the derived surface chemical composition. This analysis leads to the derivation of tight constraints on the silicates' production rates experienced by these sources during the final AGB stages. Two out of the four sources investigated are interpreted as stars currently undergoing HBB, evolving through phases close to the stage when the mass-loss rate is largest. The remaining two stars are likely evolving through the very final AGB phases, after HBB was turned off by the gradual consumption of the convective mantle. Mass-loss rates of the order of $1-2\times 10^{-4} M_{\odot}/$yr are required when looking for consistency with the observational evidence. These results indicate the need for a revision of the silicate yields by intermediate mass stars, which are found to be $\sim 3$ times higher than previously determined. |

|**Abstract**| Observations of BlueWalker 3 (BW3) beginning on December 8 of this year indicate that its apparent brightness had decreased. We postulate that the orbital beta angle and resultant solar power considerations required an adjustment to the satellite attitude around that time. So, the nominally zenith facing side of the flat-panel shaped spacecraft, which supports the solar array, was tilted toward the Sun. Consequently, the nadir side, which is seen by observers on the ground, was mostly dark. Thus, BW3 has generally appeared faint and on some occasions was not seen at all. The amount of fading was up to 4 magnitudes. Numerical modeling indicates that the amount of tilt was in the range 13{\deg} to 16{\deg}. This situation indicates the improvement in the appearance of BW3 from the ground that can be achieved with small tilts of the spacecraft. Satellite operators and astronomers can jointly address the adverse impact of bright satellites on celestial observations based on this finding. |

|**Abstract**| This study is part of an effort to build a mid-infrared database (7-14micron) of spectra for MERTIS (Mercury Radiometer and Thermal Infrared Spectrometer), an instrument onboard of the ESA/JAXA BepiColombo space probe to be launched to Mercury in 2017. Mercury was exposed to abundant impacts throughout its history. This study of terrestrial impactites can provide estimates of the effects of shock metamorphism on the mid-infrared spectral properties of planetary materials. In this study, we focus on the Noerdlinger Ries crater in Southern Germany, a well preserved and easily accessible impact crater with abundant suevite impactites. Suevite and melt glass bulk samples from Otting and Aumuehle, as well as red suevite from Polsingen were characterized and their reflectance spectra in mid-infrared range obtained. In addition, in-situ mid-infrared spectra were made from glasses and matrix areas in thin sections. The results show similar, but distinguishable spectra for both bulk suevite and melt glass samples, as well as in-situ measurements. Impact melt glass from Aumuehle and Otting have spectra dominated by a Reststrahlen band at 9.3-9.6 micron. Bulk melt rock from Polsingen and bulk suevite and fine-grained matrix have their strongest band between 9.4 to 9.6 micron. There are also features between 8.5 and 9 micron, and 12.5 - 12.8 micron associated with crystalline phases. There is evidence of weathering products in the fine-grained matrix, such as smectites. Mercury endured many impacts with impactors of all sizes over its history. So spectral characteristics observed for impactites formed only in a single impact like in the Ries impact event can be expected to be very common on planetary bodies exposed to many more impacts in their past. We conclude that in mid-infrared remote sensing data the surface of Mercury can be expected to be dominated by features of amorphous materials. |
