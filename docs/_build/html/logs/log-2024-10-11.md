|**Abstract**|            We present a transmission spectrum of the misaligned hot Jupiter WASP-15b from 2.8--5.2 microns observed with JWST's NIRSpec/G395H grating. Our high signal to noise data, which has negligible red noise, reveals significant absorption by H$_2$O ($4.2\sigma$) and CO$_2$ ($8.9\sigma$). From independent data reduction and atmospheric retrieval approaches, we infer that WASP-15b's atmospheric metallicity is super-solar ($\gtrsim 15\times$ solar) and its C/O is consistent with solar, that together imply planetesimal accretion. Our GCM simulations for WASP-15b suggest that the C/O we measure at the limb is likely representative of the entire photosphere due to the mostly uniform spatial distribution of H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CO. We additionally see evidence for absorption by SO$_2$ and absorption at 4.9$\mu$m, for which the current leading candidate is OCS, albeit with several caveats. If confirmed, this would be the first detection of OCS in an exoplanet atmosphere and point towards complex photochemistry of sulphur-bearing species in the upper atmosphere. These are the first observations from the BOWIE-ALIGN survey which is using JWST's NIRSpec/G395H instrument to compare the atmospheric compositions of aligned/low-obliquity and misaligned/high-obliquity hot Jupiters around F stars above the Kraft break. The goal of our survey is to determine whether the atmospheric composition differs across two populations of planets that have likely undergone different migration histories (disc versus disc-free) as evidenced by their obliquities (aligned versus misaligned).         |

|**Abstract**|            Three-dimensional simulations usually fail to cover the entire dynamical common-envelope phase of gravitational wave progenitor systems due to the vast range of spatial and temporal scales involved. We investigated the common-envelope interactions of a $10\,M_\odot$ red supergiant primary star with a black hole and a neutron star companion, respectively, until full envelope ejection (${\gtrsim}\,97 \,\mathrm{\%}$ of the envelope mass). We find that the dynamical plunge-in of the systems determines largely the orbital separations of the core binary system, while the envelope ejection by recombination acts only at later stages of the evolution and fails to harden the core binaries down to orbital frequencies where they qualify as progenitors of gravitational-wave-emitting double-compact object mergers. As opposed to the conventional picture of a spherically symmetric envelope ejection, our simulations show a new mechanism: The rapid plunge-in of the companion transforms the spherical morphology of the giant primary star into a disk-like structure. During this process, magnetic fields are amplified, and the subsequent transport of material through the disk around the core binary system drives a fast jet-like outflow in the polar directions. While most of the envelope material is lost through a recombination-driven wind from the outer edge of the disk, about $7\,\mathrm{\%}$ of the envelope leaves the system via the magnetically driven outflows. We further explored the potential evolutionary pathways of the post-common-envelope systems given the expected remaining lifetime of the primary core ($2.97\,M_\odot$) until core collapse ($6{\times}10^{4}\,\mathrm{yr}$), most likely forming a neutron star. We find that the interaction of the core binary system with the circumbinary disk increases the likelihood of giving rise to a double-neutron star merger. (abridged)         |

|**Abstract**|            We report on a data-driven spectral model that we have developed for the identification of double-lined spectroscopic binary stars (SB2s) in the LAMOST low-resolution survey (R$\sim$1800). Employing simultaneous fitting with both single-star and binary-star models, we detected over 4800 SB2 candidates, where both components are detectably contributing to the spectrum, from an initial pool of 2.6 million objects. Tests show that our model favors FGK-type main-sequence binaries with high mass ratio ($q\geq$ 0.7) and large radial velocity separation ($\Delta \rm RV \geq$ 100~km$\,$s$^{-1}$). Almost all of these candidates are positioned above the main sequence in the color-magnitude diagram, indicating their binary nature. Additionally, we utilized various observational data, including spectroscopy, photometry, parallax, and extinction, to determine multiple physical parameters such as the effective temperature, age, metallicity, radial velocity, mass, mass ratio, stellar radius, along with their associated uncertainties for these SB2 candidates. For the 44 candidates with seven or more observational epochs, we provide complete orbital solutions. We make available catalogs containing various stellar parameters for identified SB2 systems.         |

|**Abstract**|            Meteors are important phenomenon reflecting many properties of interplanetary dust particles. The study of their origin, mass distribution, and orbit evolution all require large data volume, which can only be obtained using large meteor networks. After meteor networks in Europe and America, we present our designs and upgrades of a proposing network in China. The new designs are mainly aimed for facilitating data gathering process. Each of the newly designed meteor stations now can support up to 4 cameras to cover the full sky. Newer version of meteor station software now works as an integral system, which can streamline the process of detecting, measuring and uploading meteors. We have built a meteor data platform to store, process and display the meteor data automatically. The software and data platform are designed to be easy to learn and use, so it can attract more people to join and operate meteor stations. Four stations are installed as the first phase of the network, and during the operation in 10 months, the network detected 8,683 orbits, and we find that half of the orbits can be related to established meteoroid streams. The statistical analysis of sporadic meteoroids shows a bimodal distribution of the velocities, which coincides with previous studies. The distribution of Tisserand parameters, $T_j$, shows the two peaks at $T_j=0$ and 3, indicating the different orbits of parent bodies (isotropic and ecliptic), which are divided by $T_j=2$. The falling trajectory of a meteorite was also predicted using observational data of the network. We are currently expanding the network, and in the future we will carry out detailed analysis of the key parameters of the distribution of the meteoroids.         |
