|**Abstract**| Ultra-hot Jupiters are highly irradiated gas giant exoplanets on close-in orbits around their host stars. We analyzed high-resolution spectra from CARMENES, HARPS-N, and ESPaDOnS taken over eight observation nights to study the emission spectrum of WASP-33b and draw conclusions about its atmosphere. By applying the cross-correlation technique, we detected the spectral signatures of Ti I, V I, and a tentative signal of Ti II for the first time via emission spectroscopy. These detections are an important finding because of the fundamental role of Ti- and V-bearing species in the planetary energy balance. Moreover, we assessed and confirm the presence of OH, Fe I, and Si I from previous studies. The spectral lines are all detected in emission, which unambiguously proves the presence of an inverted temperature profile in the planetary atmosphere. By performing retrievals on the emission lines of all the detected species, we determined a relatively weak atmospheric thermal inversion extending from approximately 3400 K to 4000 K. We infer a supersolar metallicity close to 1.5 dex in the planetary atmosphere, and find that its emission signature undergoes significant line broadening with a Gaussian FWHM of about 4.5 km/s. Also, we find that the atmospheric temperature profile retrieved at orbital phases far from the secondary eclipse is about 300 K to 700 K cooler than that measured close to the secondary eclipse, which is consistent with different day- and nightside temperatures. Moreover, retrievals performed on the emission lines of the individual chemical species lead to consistent results, which gives additional confidence to our retrieval method. Increasing the number of species included in the retrieval and expanding the set of retrieved atmospheric parameters will further advance our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres. |

|**Abstract**| Context. Our knowledge of populations and occurrence of planets orbiting evolved intermediate-mass stars is still incomplete. In 2010 we started a planet-search program among 95 giant stars observed by the Kepler mission to increase the sample of giant stars with planets and with reliable estimates of stellar masses and radii. Aims. We present the two systems KIC 3526061 and HD 187878 from our planet-search program for which we could characterise their companions. Methods. We used precise stellar radial velocity measurements taken with four different echelle spectrographs to derive an orbital solution. We used Gaia astrometric measurements to obtain the inclination of the HD 187878 system and Kepler photometric observations to estimate the stellar mass and radius. Results. We report the discovery of a sub-stellar and a stellar companion around two intermediate-mass red giant branch stars. KIC 3526061 b is most likely a brown dwarf with a minimum mass of 18.15 Jupiter masses in a long-period eccentric orbit, with the orbital period 3552 d and orbital eccentricity 0.85. It is the most evolved system found having a sub-stellar companion with such a large eccentricity and wide separation. HD 187878 B has a minimum mass of 78.4 Jupiter masses. Combining the spectroscopic orbital parameters with the astrometric proper motion anomaly we derived an orbital inclination 9.8 deg, which corresponds to the companion's mass in the stellar regime of 0.51 Sun mass. Conclusions. A sub-stellar companion of KIC 3526061 extends the sample of known red giant branch stars with sub-stellar companions on very eccentric wide orbits and might provide a probe of the dynamical evolution of such systems over time. |

|**Abstract**| To improve Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) standardisability, the consistency of distance estimates to siblings -- SNe in the same host galaxy -- should be investigated. We present Young Supernova Experiment Pan-STARRS-1 $grizy$ photometry of SN 2021hpr, the third spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia in the high-stellar-mass Cepheid-calibrator galaxy NGC 3147. We analyse NGC 3147's trio of SN Ia siblings: SNe 1997bq, 2008fv and 2021hpr, using a new version of the BayeSN model of SN Ia spectral-energy distributions, retrained simultaneously using optical-NIR $BgVrizYJH$ (0.35--1.8 $\mu$m) data. The distance estimates to each sibling are consistent, with a sample standard deviation $\lesssim$0.01 mag, much smaller than the total intrinsic scatter in the training sample: $\sigma_0\approx0.09$ mag. Fitting normal SN Ia siblings in three additional galaxies, we estimate a $\approx$90% probability that the siblings' intrinsic scatter is smaller than $\sigma_0$. We build a new hierarchical model that fits light curves of siblings in a single galaxy simultaneously; this yields more precise estimates of the common distance and the dust parameters. Fitting the trio for a common dust law shape yields $R_V=2.69\pm0.52$. Our work motivates future hierarchical modelling of more siblings, to tightly constrain their intrinsic scatter, and better understand SN-host correlations. Finally, we estimate the Hubble constant, using a Cepheid distance to NGC 3147, the siblings trio, and 109 Hubble flow ($0.01 < z_{\rm{CMB}} < 0.08$) SNe Ia; marginalising over the siblings' and population's intrinsic scatters, and the peculiar velocity dispersion, yields $H_0=77.9\pm6.5 \text{ km s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-1}$. |

|**Abstract**| The cold dark matter (DM) model predicts that every galaxy contains thousands of DM subhalos; almost all other DM models include a physical process that smooths away the subhalos. The subhalos are invisible, but could be detected via strong gravitational lensing, if they lie on the line of sight to a multiply-imaged background source, and perturb its apparent shape. We present an automated strong lens analysis framework, and scan for DM subhalos in Hubble Space Telescope imaging of 54 strong lenses. We identify two compelling DM subhalo candidates (including one previously found in SLACS0946+1006), where a subhalo is favoured after every systematic test we perform. We find that the detectability of subhalos depends upon the assumed parametric form for the lens galaxy's mass distribution. Comparing fits which assume several more complex mass models reveals $5$ additional (generally lower mass) DM subhalo candidates worthy of further study, and the removal of 11 false positives. We identify 44 non-detections, which are vital to building up enough statistical power to test DM models. Future work will apply even more flexible models to the results of this study, to constrain different DM models. Our full analysis results are available at https://github.com/Jammy2211/autolens_subhalo. |

|**Abstract**| Microcalorimeters have demonstrated success in delivering high spectral resolution, and have paved the path to revolutionary new science possibilities in the coming decade of X-ray astronomy. There are several research areas in compact object science that can only be addressed with energy resolution Delta(E)<~5 eV at photon energies of a few keV, corresponding to velocity resolution of <~a few hundred km/s, to be ushered in by microcalorimeters. Here, we review some of these outstanding questions, focusing on how the research landscape is set to be transformed (i) at the interface between accreting supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, (ii) in unravelling the structures of accretion environments, (iii) in resolving long-standing issues on the origins of energy and matter feedback, and (iv) to test mass-scaled unification of accretion and feedback. The need to learn lessons from Hitomi and to make improvements in laboratory atomic data precision as well as plasma modeling are highlighted. |

|**Abstract**| Hot Jupiters on extremely short-period orbits are expected to be unstable to tidal dissipation and spiral toward their host stars. That is because they transfer the angular momentum of the orbital motion through tidal dissipation into the stellar interior. Although the magnitude of this phenomenon is related to the physical properties of a specific star-planet system, statistical studies show that tidal dissipation might shape the architecture of hot Jupiter systems during the stellar lifetime on the main sequence. The efficiency of tidal dissipation remains poorly constrained in star-planet systems. Stellar interior models show that the dissipation of dynamical tides in radiation zones could be the dominant mechanism driving planetary orbital decay. These theoretical predictions can be verified with the transit timing method. We acquired new precise transit mid-times for five planets. They were previously identified as the best candidates for which orbital decay might be detected. Analysis of the timing data allowed us to place tighter constraints on the orbital decay rate. No statistically significant changes in their orbital periods were detected for all five hot Jupiters in systems HAT-P-23, KELT-1, KELT-16, WASP-18, and WASP-103. For planets HAT-P-23 b, WASP-18 b, and WASP-103 b, observations show that the mechanism of the dynamical tides dissipation probably does not operate in their host stars, preventing them from rapid orbital decay. This finding aligns with the models of stellar interiors of F-type stars, in which dynamical tides are not fully damped due to convective cores. For KELT-16 b, the span of transit timing data was not long enough to verify the theoretical predictions. KELT-1 b was identified as a potential laboratory for studying the dissipative tidal interactions of inertial waves in a convective layer. |

|**Abstract**| Pulsating stars, such as Cepheids and RR Lyrae, offer us a window to measure and study changes due to stellar evolution. In this work, we study the former by calculating a set of evolutionary tracks of stars with an initial mass of 4 to 7 $M_\odot$, varying the initial rotation rate and metallicity, using the stellar evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). Using Radial Stellar Pulsations (RSP), a recently added functionality of MESA, we obtained theoretical instability strip (IS) edges and linear periods for the radial fundamental mode. Period-age, period-age-temperature, period-luminosity, and period-luminosity-temperature relationships were derived for three rotation rates and metallicities, showing a dependence on crossing number, position in the IS, rotation, and metallicity. We calculated period change rates (PCRs) based on the linear periods from RSP. We compared our models with literature results using the Geneva code, and found large differences, as expected due to the different implementations of rotation between codes. In addition, we compared our theoretical PCRs with those measured in our recent work for Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheids. We found good overall agreement, even though our models do not reach the short-period regime exhibited by the empirical data. Implementations of physical processes not yet included in our models, such as pulsation-driven mass loss, an improved treatment of convection that may lead to a better description of the instability strip edges, as well as consideration of a wider initial mass range, could all help improve the agreement with the observed PCRs. |

|**Abstract**| The sample of Solar system objects has dramatically increased over the last decade. The amount of measured properties (e.g., diameter, taxonomy, rotation period, thermal inertia) has grown even faster. However, this wealth of information is spread over a myriad of articles, under many different designations per object. We provide a solution to the identification of Solar system objects from any of their multiple names or designations. We also compile and rationalize their properties to provide an easy access to them. We aim to continuously update the database as new measurements become available. We built a Web Service, SsODNet, that offers four access points, each corresponding to an identified necessity in the community: name resolution (quaero), compilation of a large corpus of properties (datacloud), determination of the best estimate among compiled values (ssoCard), and statistical description of the population (ssoBFT). The SsODNet interfaces are fully operational and freely accessible to everyone. The name resolver quaero translates any of the ~5.3 million designations of objects into their current official designation. The datacloud compiles about 105 million parameters (osculating and proper elements, pair and family membership, diameter, albedo, mass, density, rotation period, spin coordinates, phase function parameters, colors, taxonomy, thermal inertia, and Yarkovsky drift) from over 3,000 articles (and growing). For each of the known asteroids and dwarf planets (~1.2 million), a ssoCard providing a single best-estimate for each parameter is available. The SsODNet service provides these resources in a fraction of second upon query. Finally, the large ssoBFT table compiles all the best-estimates in a single table for population-wide studies. |

|**Abstract**| Based on luminosity contributions, we develop a spectroscopic modelling method to derive atmospheric parameters of component stars in binary systems. The method is designed for those spectra of binaries which show double-lined features due to the radial velocities differences between the component stars. We first derive the orbital parameters and the stellar radii by solving the light and radial velocity curves. Then the luminosity contributions in different phases can be calculated. The synthesised double-lined spectra model is constructed by superposing theoretical single-star spectra according to the luminosity contributions. Finally, we derive the atmospheric parameters of each component star by the model fitting method. For multi-epoch double-lined spectra observed by the Large sky Area Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) Medium Resolution Survey ($R \sim 7500$), our method gives robust results for detached eclipsing binary systems observed in different orbital phases. Furthermore, this method can also be applied to other spectroscopic data with different resolutions as long as the systems are detached eclipsing binaries with nearly spherical stars. |

|**Abstract**| After in quiescence for 49 years, 4U~1730--22 became active and had two outbursts in 2021 \& 2022; ten thermonuclear X-ray bursts were detected with Insight-HXMT. Among them, the faintest burst showed a double-peaked profile, placing the source as the 5th accreting neutron star (NS) exhibiting double/triple-peaked type-I X-ray bursts; the other bursts showed photospheric radius expansion (PRE). The properties of double-peaked non-PRE burst indicate that it could be related to a stalled burning front. For the five bright PRE bursts, apart from the emission from the neutron star (NS) surface, we find the residuals both in the soft ($<$3 keV) and hard ($>$10 keV) X-ray band. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals that the excess can be attributed to an enhanced pre-burst/persistent emission or the Comptonization of the burst emission by the corona/boundary-layer. We find, the burst emission shows a rise until the photosphere touches down to the NS surface rather than the theoretical predicted constant Eddington luminosity. The shortage of the burst emission in the early rising phase is beyond the occlusion by the disk. We speculate that the findings above correspond to that the obscured part (not only the lower part) of the NS surface is exposed to the line of sight due to the evaporation of the obscured material by the burst emission, or the burst emission is anisotropic ($\xi>1$) in the burst early phase. In addition, based on the average flux of PRE bursts at their touch-down time, we derive a distance estimation as 10.4 kpc. |

|**Abstract**| Up to now, jet kinematic studies of radio quasars have barely reached beyond the redshift range at $z>3.5$. This significantly limits our knowledge of high-redshift jets, which can provide key information for understanding the jet nature and the growth of the black holes in the early Universe. In this paper, we selected 9 radio-loud quasars at $z>3.5$ which display milliarcsec-scale jet morphology. We provided evidence on the source nature by presenting high-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) images of the sample at 8.4~GHz frequency and making spectral index maps. We also consider Gaia optical positions that are available for 7 out of the 9 quasars, for a better identification of the jet components within the radio structures. We find that 6 sources can be classified as core--jet blazars. The remaining 3 objects are more likely young, jetted radio sources, compact symmetric objects. By including multi-epoch archival VLBI data, we also obtained jet component proper motions of the sample and estimated the jet kinematic and geometric parameters (Doppler factor, Lorentz factor, viewing angle). Our results show that at $z>3.5$, the jet apparent transverse speeds do not exceed 20 times the speed of light ($c$). This is consistent with earlier high-redshift quasar measurements in the literature and the tendency derived from low-redshift blazars that fast jet speeds ($>40\,c$) only occur at low redshifts. The results from this paper contribute to the understanding of the cosmological evolution of radio AGN. |

|**Abstract**| Magnetic fields in the ionized medium of the disk and halo of the Milky Way impose Faraday rotation on linearly polarized radio emission. We compare two surveys mapping the Galactic Faraday rotation, one showing the rotation measures of extragalactic sources seen through the Galaxy (from Hutschenreuter et al 2022), and one showing the Faraday depth of the diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission from the Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey. Comparing the two data sets in 5deg x 10deg bins shows good agreement at intermediate latitudes, 10 < |b| < 50 deg, and little correlation between them at lower and higher latitudes. Where they agree, both tracers show clear patterns as a function of Galactic longitude: in the Northern Hemisphere a strong sin(2 x longitude) pattern, and in the Southern hemisphere a sin(longitude + pi) pattern. Pulsars with height above or below the plane |z| > 300 pc show similar longitude dependence in their rotation measures. Nearby non-thermal structures show rotation measure shadows as does the Orion-Eridanus superbubble. We describe families of dynamo models that could explain the observed patterns in the two hemispheres. We suggest that a field reversal, known to cross the plane a few hundred pc inside the solar circle, could shift to positive z with increasing Galactic radius to explain the sin(2xlongitude) pattern in the Northern Hemisphere. Correlation shows that rotation measures from extragalactic sources are one to two times the corresponding rotation measure of the diffuse emission, implying Faraday complexity along some lines of sight, especially in the Southern hemisphere. |

|**Abstract**| GRB 220426A is a bright gamma-ray burst (GRB) dominated by the photospheric emission. We perform several tests to speculate the origin of this photospheric emission. The dimensionless entropy $\eta$ is large, which is not usual if we assume that it is a pure hot fireball launched by neutrino-antineutrino annihilation mechanism only. Moreover, the outflow has larger $\eta$ with lower luminosity $L$ in the first few seconds, so that the trend of time-resolved $\eta-L$ can not be described as a monotonically positive correlation between $\eta$ and $L$. A hybrid outflow with almost completely thermalized Poynting flux could account for the quasi-thermal spectrum as well as large $\eta$. More importantly, the existence of magnetic field could affect the proton density and neutron-proton coupling effect, so that it could account for the observed trend of time-resolved $\eta-L$. The other origins for the photospheric emission, such as non-dissipative hybrid outflow or magnetic reconnection, are not supported because their radiation efficiencies are low, which is not consistent with non-detection of the afterglow for GRB 220426A. Therefore, we think the hybrid outflow may be the most likely origin. |

|**Abstract**| NGC 5548 is one of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) selected for our long-term spectroscopic monitoring with the Lijiang 2.4~m telescope, aiming at investigating the origin and evolution of the broad-line regions (BLRs), accurately measuring the mass of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs), and understanding structure and evolution of the AGN. We have performed five-season observations for NGC~5548 with the median sampling interval ranging from 1.25 to 3 days. The light curves of the 5100~\AA\ continuum and broad emission lines are measured after subtracting contamination of the host galaxy starlight. The time lags of the broad He~{\sc ii}, He~{\sc i}, H$\gamma$, and H$\beta$ lines with respect to the 5100~\AA\ continuum are obtained for each season and their mean time lags over the five seasons are 0.69, 4.66, 4.60, 8.43 days, respectively. The H$\gamma$ and H$\beta$ velocity-resolved lag profiles in the seasons of 2015, 2018, 2019, and 2021 are constructed, from which an ``M-shaped'' structure is found in 2015 but disappears after 2018. Our five-season reverberation mapping (RM) yields an averaged virial SMBH mass of $M_\bullet/10^7M_\odot=14.22$, with a small standard deviation of $1.89$. By combining the previous 18 RM campaigns and our five-season campaign for NGC~5548, we find that there exists a time lag of 3.5~years between the changes in the BLR size and optical luminosity. In addition, we also construct the BLR radius$-$luminosity relation and the virial relation for NGC~5548. |

|**Abstract**| Recent developments in time domain astronomy, like the Zwicky Transient Facility, have made possible a daily scan of the entire visible sky, leading to the discovery of hundreds of new transients every night. Among them, 10 to 15 are supernovae (SNe), which have to be classified prior to cosmological use. The Spectral Energy Distribution machine (SEDm), a low resolution Integral Field Spectrograph, has been designed, built, and operated to spectroscopically classify targets detected by the ZTF main camera. The current Pysedm pipeline is limited by contamination when the transient is too close to its host galaxy core; this can lead to an incorrect typing and ultimately bias the cosmological analyses, and affect the SN sample homogeneity in terms of local environment properties. We present a new scene modeler to extract the transient spectrum from its structured background, aiming at improving the typing efficiency of the SEDm. HyperGal is a fully chromatic scene modeler, which uses pre-transient photometric images to generate a hyperspectral model of the host galaxy; it is based on the CIGALE SED fitter used as a physically-motivated spectral interpolator. The galaxy model, complemented by a point source and a diffuse background component, is projected onto the SEDm spectro-spatial observation space and adjusted to observations. The full procedure is validated on 5000 simulated cubes. We introduce the contrast as the transient-to-total flux ratio at SN location. From estimated contrast distribution of real SEDm observations, we show that HyperGal correctly classifies ~95% of SNe Ia. Compared to the standard extraction method, HyperGal correctly classifies 10% more SNe Ia. The false positive rate is less than 2%, half as much as the standard extraction method. Assuming a similar contrast distribution for core-collapse SNe, HyperGal classifies 14% (11%) additional SNe II (Ibc). |

|**Abstract**| Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs), which carry time features and plasma characteristics of flare emissions, are frequently observed in light curves of solar/stellar flares. In this paper, we investigated non-stationary QPPs associated with recurrent jets during an M1.2 flare on 2022 July 14. A quasi-period of about 45$\pm$10 s, determined by the wavelet transform technique, is simultaneously identified at wavelengths of soft/hard X-ray and microwave emissions, which are recorded by the Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor, Fermi, and the Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters, respectively. A group of recurrent jets with an intermittent cadence of about 45$\pm$10 s are found in Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) image series at 304 {\AA}, but they are 180-s earlier than the flare QPP. All observational facts suggest that the flare QPP could be excited by recurrent jets, and they should be associated with nonthermal electrons that are periodically accelerated by a repeated energy release process, like repetitive magnetic reconnection. Moreover, the same quasi-period is discovered at double footpoints connected by a hot flare loop in AIA 94 {\AA}, and the phase speed is measured to 1420 km/s. Based on the differential emission measure, the average temperatures, number densities, and magnetic field strengths at the loop top and footpoint are estimated to 7.7/6.7 MK, 7.5/3.6*10^{10} cm ^{-3}, and 143/99 G, respectively. Our measurements indicate that the 45-s QPP is probably modulated by the kink-mode wave of the flare loop. |

|**Abstract**| Thermal bombs are a widely used method to artificially trigger explosions of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) to determine their nucleosynthesis or ejecta and remnant properties. Recently, their use in spherically symmetric (1D) hydrodynamic simulations led to the result that {56,57}Ni and 44Ti are massively underproduced compared to observational estimates for Supernova 1987A, if the explosions are slow, i.e., if the explosion mechanism of CCSNe releases the explosion energy on long timescales. It was concluded that rapid explosions are required to match observed abundances, i.e., the explosion mechanism must provide the CCSN energy nearly instantaneously on timescales of some ten to order 100 ms. This result, if valid, would disfavor the neutrino-heating mechanism, which releases the CCSN energy on timescales of seconds. Here, we demonstrate by 1D hydrodynamic simulations and nucleosynthetic post-processing that these conclusions are a consequence of disregarding the initial collapse of the stellar core in the thermal-bomb modelling before the bomb releases the explosion energy. We demonstrate that the anti-correlation of 56Ni yield and energy-injection timescale vanishes when the initial collapse is included and that it can even be reversed, i.e., more 56Ni is made by slower explosions, when the collapse proceeds to small radii similar to those where neutrino heating takes place in CCSNe. We also show that the 56Ni production in thermal-bomb explosions is sensitive to the chosen mass cut and that a fixed mass layer or fixed volume for the energy deposition cause only secondary differences. Moreover, we propose a most appropriate setup for thermal bombs. |

|**Abstract**| Three tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates (AT2019dsg, AT2019fdr, AT2019aalc) have been found to be coincident with high energy astrophysical neutrinos in multi-messenger follow-ups. Recent studies suggest the presence of a quasi-spherical, optically thick envelope around the supermassive black holes in TDEs, resulted from stellar debris after the disruption. We study whether the neutrino signal can be explained by choked relativistic jets inside the envelope. While powerful jets, such as that in Swift J1644+57, can successfully break out the envelope, those with relatively weak power could be choked by the envelope. Choked jets can still accelerate cosmic rays through internal shocks or reverse shocks deep in the envelope, which further produce high-energy neutrinos via interaction with the thermal photons in the envelope. We explore the parameter space of the jets that can produce detectable neutrino flux while being choked. Under reasonable assumption about the envelope mass, we find that the cumulative neutrino numbers of three TDEs are consistent with the expected range imposed by observations. Compared with other proposed models, the relativistic bulk motion of the jets in our model can magnify the neutrino flux by Lorentz boosting. The neutrino time delay relative to the optical peak time of TDEs can be explained as the jet propagation time in the envelope before being choked. The discovery of TDE-associated neutrino events may suggest that jets might have been commonly formed in TDEs, as expected from super-Eddington accretion, but most of them are too weak to break out of the envelopes. |

|**Abstract**| The recurrent nova RS Oph underwent a new outburst on August 8, 2021, reaching a visible brightness of V = 4.8 mag. Observations of the 2021 outburst made with the high resolution UVES spectrograph at the Kueyen-UT2 telescope of ESO-VLT in Paranal enabled detection of the possible presence of 7Be freshly made in the thermonuclear runaway reactions. The 7Be yields can be estimated in N(Be)/N(H) = 5.7 x 10^(-6), which are close to the lowest yields measured in classical novae so far. 7Be is short-lived and decays only into 7Li. By means of a spectrum taken during the nebular phase we estimated an ejected mass of about 1.1 x 10^(-5) Msun, providing an amount of about 4.4x 10^(-10) Msun of 7Li created in the 2021 event. Recurrent novae of the kind of RS Oph may synthesize slightly lower amount of 7Li per event as classical novae, but occur 10^3 times more frequently. The recurrent novae fraction is in the range of 10-30% and they could have contributed to the making of 7Li we observe today. The detection of 7Be in RS Oph provides further support to the recent suggestion that novae are the most effective source of 7Li in the Galaxy. |

|**Abstract**| Blazars are active galactic nuclei whose ultra-relativistic jets are coaligned with the observer direction. They emit throughout the whole e.m. spectrum, from radio waves to VHE gamma rays. Not all blazars are discovered. In this work, we propose a catalog of 54 new candidates based on the association of HE gamma ray emission and radio, X-ray an optical signatures. The relevance of this work is also that it was performed by four high school students from the Liceo Scientifico Statale Ugo Morin in Venice, Italy using the open-source platform Open Universe, in collaboration with the University of Padova. The framework of the activity is the Italian MIUR PCTO programme. The success of this citizen-science experience and results are hereafter reported and discussed. |

|**Abstract**| Strong gravitational lensed quasars (QSOs) have emerged as powerful and novel cosmic probes as they can deliver crucial cosmological information, such as a measurement of the Hubble constant, independent of other probes. Although the upcoming LSST survey is expected to discover $10^3-10^4$ lensed QSOs, a large fraction will remain unresolved due to seeing. The stochastic nature of the quasar intrinsic flux makes it challenging to identify lensed ones and measure the time delays using unresolved light curve data only. In this regard, Bag et al (2022) introduced a data-driven technique based on the minimization of the fluctuation in the reconstructed image light curves. In this article, we delve deeper into the mathematical foundation of this approach. We show that the lensing signal in the fluctuation curve is dominated by the auto-correlation function (ACF) of the derivative of the joint light curve. This explains why the fluctuation curve enables the detection of the lensed QSOs only using the joint light curve, without making assumptions about QSO flux variability, nor requiring any additional information. We show that the ACF of the derivative of the joint light curve is more reliable than the ACF of the joint light curve itself because intrinsic quasar flux variability shows significant auto-correlation up to a few hundred days (as they follow a red power spectrum). In addition, we show that the minimization of fluctuation approach provides even better precision and recall as compared to the ACF of the derivative of the joint light curve when the data have significant observational noise. |

|**Abstract**| We present the results of the first Machine Learning Gravitational-Wave Search Mock Data Challenge (MLGWSC-1). For this challenge, participating groups had to identify gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole mergers of increasing complexity and duration embedded in progressively more realistic noise. The final of the 4 provided datasets contained real noise from the O3a observing run and signals up to a duration of 20 seconds with the inclusion of precession effects and higher order modes. We present the average sensitivity distance and runtime for the 6 entered algorithms derived from 1 month of test data unknown to the participants prior to submission. Of these, 4 are machine learning algorithms. We find that the best machine learning based algorithms are able to achieve up to 95% of the sensitive distance of matched-filtering based production analyses for simulated Gaussian noise at a false-alarm rate (FAR) of one per month. In contrast, for real noise, the leading machine learning search achieved 70%. For higher FARs the differences in sensitive distance shrink to the point where select machine learning submissions outperform traditional search algorithms at FARs $\geq 200$ per month on some datasets. Our results show that current machine learning search algorithms may already be sensitive enough in limited parameter regions to be useful for some production settings. To improve the state-of-the-art, machine learning algorithms need to reduce the false-alarm rates at which they are capable of detecting signals and extend their validity to regions of parameter space where modeled searches are computationally expensive to run. Based on our findings we compile a list of research areas that we believe are the most important to elevate machine learning searches to an invaluable tool in gravitational-wave signal detection. |

|**Abstract**| We present the discovery of TOI-5205b, a transiting Jovian planet orbiting a solar metallicity M4V star, which was discovered using TESS photometry and then confirmed using a combination of precise radial velocities, ground-based photometry, spectra and speckle imaging. The host star TOI-5205 sits near the eponymous `Jao gap', which is the transition region between partially and fully-convective M dwarfs. TOI-5205b has one of the highest mass ratio for M dwarf planets with a mass ratio of almost 0.3$\%$, as it orbits a host star that is just $0.392 \pm 0.015$ $M_{\odot}$. Its planetary radius is $1.03 \pm 0.03~R_J$, while the mass is $1.08 \pm 0.06~M_J$. Additionally, the large size of the planet orbiting a small star results in a transit depth of $\sim 7\%$, making it one of the deepest transits of a confirmed exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star. The large transit depth makes TOI-5205b a compelling target to probe its atmospheric properties, as a means of tracing the potential formation pathways. While there have been radial velocity-only discoveries of giant planets around mid M dwarfs, this is the first transiting Jupiter with a mass measurement discovered around such a low-mass host star. The high mass of TOI-5205b stretches conventional theories of planet formation and disk scaling relations that cannot easily recreate the conditions required to form such planets. |

|**Abstract**| The deuterium-to-hydrogen (D/H or 2H/1H) ratio of Martian atmospheric water (~6x standard mean ocean water, SMOW) is higher than that of known sources, requiring planetary enrichment. A recent measurement by NASA's Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity of >3 Gyr clays yields a D/H ratio ~3x SMOW, demonstrating that most enrichment occurs early in Mars's history. As on Venus, Mars's D/H enrichment is thought to reflect preferential loss to space of 1H (protium) relative to 2H (deuterium), but the global environmental context of large and early hydrogen losses remain to be determined. Here, we apply a recent model of primordial atmosphere evolution to Mars, link the magma ocean of the accretion epoch with a subsequent water-ocean epoch, and calculate the behavior of deuterium for comparison with the observed record. We find that a ~2-3x hydrospheric deuterium-enrichment is produced if the Martian magma ocean is chemically reducing at last equilibration with the primordial atmosphere, making H2-CO the initially dominant species, with minor abundances of H2O-CO2. Reducing gases - in particular H2 - can cause greenhouse warming and prevent a water ocean from freezing immediately after the magma ocean epoch. Moreover, the pressure-temperature conditions are high enough to produce ocean-atmosphere H2O-H2 isotopic equilibrium such that surface H2O strongly concentrates deuterium relative to H2, which preferentially takes up protium and escapes from the primordial atmosphere. The proposed scenario of primordial H2-rich outgassing and escape suggests significant durations (>Myr) of chemical conditions on the Martian surface conducive to prebiotic chemistry immediately following Martian accretion. |
