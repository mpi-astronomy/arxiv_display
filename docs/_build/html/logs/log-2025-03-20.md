|**Abstract**|            The first Euclid Quick Data Release, Q1, comprises 63.1 sq deg of the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs) to nominal wide-survey depth. It encompasses visible and near-infrared space-based imaging and spectroscopic data, ground-based photometry in the u, g, r, i and z bands, as well as corresponding masks. Overall, Q1 contains about 30 million objects in three areas near the ecliptic poles around the EDF-North and EDF-South, as well as the EDF-Fornax field in the constellation of the same name. The purpose of this data release -- and its associated technical papers -- is twofold. First, it is meant to inform the community of the enormous potential of the Euclid survey data, to describe what is contained in these data, and to help prepare expectations for the forthcoming first major data release DR1. Second, it enables a wide range of initial scientific projects with wide-survey Euclid data, ranging from the early Universe to the Solar System. The Q1 data were processed with early versions of the processing pipelines, which already demonstrate good performance, with numerous improvements in implementation compared to pre-launch development. In this paper, we describe the sky areas released in Q1, the observations, a top-level view of the data processing of Euclid and associated external data, the Q1 photometric masks, and how to access the data. We also give an overview of initial scientific results obtained using the Q1 data set by Euclid Consortium scientists, and conclude with important caveats when using the data. As a complementary product, Q1 also contains observations of a star-forming area in Lynd's Dark Nebula 1641 in the Orion~A Cloud, observed for technical purposes during Euclid's performance-verification phase. This is a unique target, of a type not commonly found in Euclid's nominal sky survey.         |

|**Abstract**|            This paper describes the VIS Processing Function (VIS PF) of the Euclid ground segment pipeline, which processes and calibrates raw data from the VIS camera. We present the algorithms used in each processing element, along with a description of the on-orbit performance of VIS PF, based on Performance Verification (PV) and Q1 data. We demonstrate that the principal performance metrics (image quality, astrometric accuracy, photometric calibration) are within pre-launch specifications. The image-to-image photometric scatter is less than $0.8\%$, and absolute astrometric accuracy compared to Gaia is $5$ mas Image quality is stable over all Q1 images with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $0.\!^{\prime\prime}16$. The stacked images (combining four nominal and two short exposures) reach $I_\mathrm{E} = 25.6$ ($10\sigma$, measured as the variance of $1.\!^{\prime\prime}3$ diameter apertures). We also describe quality control metrics provided with each image, and an appendix provides a detailed description of the provided data products. The excellent quality of these images demonstrates the immense potential of Euclid VIS data for weak lensing. VIS data, covering most of the extragalactic sky, will provide a lasting high-resolution atlas of the Universe.         |

|**Abstract**|            This paper describes the near-infrared processing function (NIR PF) that processes near-infrared images from the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) instrument onboard the Euclid satellite. NIR PF consists of three main components: (i) a common pre-processing stage for both photometric (NIR) and spectroscopic (SIR) data to remove instrumental effects; (ii) astrometric and photometric calibration of NIR data, along with catalogue extraction; and (iii) resampling and stacking. The necessary calibration products are generated using dedicated pipelines that process observations from both the early performance verification (PV) phase in 2023 and the nominal survey operations. After outlining the pipeline's structure and algorithms, we demonstrate its application to Euclid Q1 images. For Q1, we achieve an astrometric accuracy of 9-15 mas, a relative photometric accuracy of 5 mmag, and an absolute flux calibration limited by the 1% uncertainty of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) CALSPEC database. We characterise the point-spread function (PSF) that we find very stable across the focal plane, and we discuss current limitations of NIR PF that will be improved upon for future data releases.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the results of the single-component Sérsic profile fitting for the magnitude-limited sample of \IE$<23$ galaxies within the 63.1 deg$^2$ area of the Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). The associated morphological catalogue includes two sets of structural parameters fitted using \texttt{SourceXtractor++}: one for VIS \IE images and one for a combination of three NISP images in \YE, \JE and \HE bands. We compare the resulting Sérsic parameters to other morphological measurements provided in the Q1 data release, and to the equivalent parameters based on higher-resolution \HST imaging. These comparisons confirm the consistency and the reliability of the fits to Q1 data. Our analysis of colour gradients shows that NISP profiles have systematically smaller effective radii ($R_{\rm e}$) and larger Sérsic indices ($n$) than in VIS. In addition, we highlight trends in NISP-to-VIS parameter ratios with both magnitude and $n_{\rm VIS}$. From the 2D bimodality of the $(u-r)$ colour-$\log(n)$ plane, we define a $(u-r)_{\rm lim}(n)$ that separates early- and late-type galaxies (ETGs and LTGs). We use the two subpopulations to examine the variations of $n$ across well-known scaling relations at $z<1$. ETGs display a steeper size--stellar mass relation than LTGs, indicating a difference in the main drivers of their mass assembly. Similarly, LTGs and ETGs occupy different parts of the stellar mass--star-formation rate plane, with ETGs at higher masses than LTGs, and further down below the Main Sequence of star-forming galaxies. This clear separation highlights the link known between the shutdown of star formation and morphological transformations in the Euclid imaging data set. In conclusion, our analysis demonstrates both the robustness of the Sérsic fits available in the Q1 morphological catalogue and the wealth of information they provide for studies of galaxy evolution with Euclid.         |

|**Abstract**|            Modern astronomical surveys, such as the Euclid mission, produce high-dimensional, multi-modal data sets that include imaging and spectroscopic information for millions of galaxies. These data serve as an ideal benchmark for large, pre-trained multi-modal models, which can leverage vast amounts of unlabelled data. In this work, we present the first exploration of Euclid data with AstroPT, an autoregressive multi-modal foundation model trained on approximately 300 000 optical and infrared Euclid images and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the first Euclid Quick Data Release. We compare self-supervised pre-training with baseline fully supervised training across several tasks: galaxy morphology classification; redshift estimation; similarity searches; and outlier detection. Our results show that: (a) AstroPT embeddings are highly informative, correlating with morphology and effectively isolating outliers; (b) including infrared data helps to isolate stars, but degrades the identification of edge-on galaxies, which are better captured by optical images; (c) simple fine-tuning of these embeddings for photometric redshift and stellar mass estimation outperforms a fully supervised approach, even when using only 1% of the training labels; and (d) incorporating SED data into AstroPT via a straightforward multi-modal token-chaining method improves photo-z predictions, and allow us to identify potentially more interesting anomalies (such as ringed or interacting galaxies) compared to a model pre-trained solely on imaging data.         |

|**Abstract**|            The extent to which the environment affects galaxy evolution has been under scrutiny by researchers for decades. With the first data from Euclid, we can begin to study a wide range of environments and their effects as a function of redshift, using 63 sq deg of space-based data. In this paper, we present results from the Euclid Q1 Release, where we measure the passive-density and morphology-density relations at z=0.25--1. We determine if a galaxy is passive using the specific star-formation rate, and we classify the morphologies of galaxies using the Sérsic index n and the u-r colours. We measure the local environmental density of each galaxy using the Nth-nearest neighbour method. We find that at fixed stellar mass, the quenched fraction increases with increasing density up to z=0.75. This result shows the separability of the effects from the stellar mass and the environment, at least at z<0.75. At z>0.75, we observe weak environmental effects, with most high mass galaxies being quenched independently of environment. Up to z=0.75, the ETG fraction increases with density at fixed stellar mass, meaning the environment also transforms the morphology of the galaxy independently of stellar mass, at low mass. For high mass galaxies, almost all galaxies are early-types, with low impact from the environment. At z>0.75, the morphology depends mostly on stellar mass, with only low-mass galaxies being affected by the environment. Given that the morphology classifications use u-r colours, these are correlated to the star-formation rate, and as such our morphology results should be taken with caution; future morphology classifications should verify these results. To summarise, we identify the passive-density and morphology-density relations at z<0.75, but at z>0.75 the relations are less strong. At z>0.75, the uncertainties are large, and future Euclid data releases are key to confirm these trends.         |

|**Abstract**|            Investigating the drivers of the quenching of star formation in galaxies is key to understanding their evolution. The Euclid mission will provide rich spatial and spectral data from optical to infrared wavelengths for millions of galaxies, enabling precise measurements of their star formation histories. Using the first Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1), we developed a probabilistic classification framework, that combines the average specific star-formation rate ($\rm sSFR_\tau$) inferred over two timescales ($\tau={10^8,10^9}$ yr), to categorize galaxies as `Ageing' (secularly evolving), `Quenched' (recently halted star formation), or `Retired' (dominated by old stars). We validated this methodology using synthetic observations from the IllustrisTNG simulation. Two classification methods were employed: a probabilistic approach, integrating posterior distributions, and a model-driven method optimizing sample purity and completeness using IllustrisTNG. At $z<0.1$ and $M_\ast \gtrsim 3\times10^{8}\, M_\odot$, we obtain Euclid class fractions of 68-72%, 8-17%, and 14-19% for Ageing, Quenched, and Retired populations, respectively, consistent with previous studies. The evolution with redshift shows increasing/decreasing fraction of Ageing/Retired galaxies. The fraction of quenched systems shows a weaker dependence on stellar mass and redshift, varying between 5% and 15%. We analysed the mass-size-metallicity relation for each population. Ageing galaxies generally exhibit disc morphologies and low metallicities. Retired galaxies show compact structures and enhanced chemical enrichment, while Quenched galaxies form an intermediate population, more compact and chemically evolved than Ageing systems. This work demonstrates Euclid's great potential for elucidating the physical nature of the quenching mechanisms that govern galaxy evolution.         |

|**Abstract**|            To better understand the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxy evolution, it is crucial to achieve a complete and pure AGN census. X-ray surveys are key to this, but identifying their counterparts (CTPs) at other wavelengths remains challenging due to their larger positional uncertainties and limited availability of deeper, uniform ancillary data. Euclid is revolutionising this effort, offering extensive coverage of nearly the entire extragalactic sky, particularly in the near-infrared bands, where AGN are more easily detected. With the first Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1), we identifyed, classifyed, and determined the redshifts of Euclid CTPs to known point-like sources from major X-ray surveys, including XMM-Newton, Chandra, and eROSITA. Using Bayesian statistics, combined with machine learning (ML), we identify the CTPs to 11 286 X-ray sources from the three X-ray telescopes. For the large majority of 10 194 sources, the associations are unique, with the remaining $\sim$ 10% of multi-CTP cases equally split between XMM-Newton and eROSITA. ML is then used to distinguish between Galactic (8%) and extragalactic (92%) sources. We computed photo-zs using deep learning for the 8617 sources detected in the 10th data release of the DESI Legacy Survey, reaching an accuracy and a fraction of outliers of about 5%. Based on their X-ray luminosities, over 99% of CTPs identified as extragalactic are classified as AGN, most of which appear unobscured given their hardness ratios. With this paper, we release our catalogue, which includes identifiers, basic X-ray properties, the details of the associations, and additional features such as Galactic/extragalactic classifications and photometric/spectroscopic redshifts. We also provide probabilities for sub-selecting the sample based on purity and completeness, allowing users to tailor the sample according to their specific needs.         |

|**Abstract**|            Galaxy major mergers are a key pathway to trigger AGN. We present the first detection of major mergers in the Euclid Deep Fields and analyse their connection with AGN. We constructed a stellar-mass-complete ($M_*>10^{9.8}\,M_{\odot}$) sample of galaxies from the first quick data release (Q1), in the redshift range z=0.5-2. We selected AGN using X-ray data, optical spectroscopy, mid-infrared colours, and processing \IE observations with an image decomposition algorithm. We used CNNs trained on cosmological simulations to classify galaxies as mergers and non-mergers. We found a larger fraction of AGN in mergers compared to the non-merger controls for all AGN selections, with AGN excess factors ranging from 2 to 6. Likewise, a generally larger merger fraction ($f_{merg}$) is seen in active galaxies than in the non-active controls. We analysed $f_{merg}$ as a function of the AGN bolometric luminosity ($L_{bol}$) and the contribution of the point-source to the total galaxy light in the \IE-band ($f_{PSF}$) as a proxy for the relative AGN contribution fraction. We uncovered a rising $f_{merg}$, with increasing $f_{PSF}$ up to $f_{PSF}=0.55$, after which we observed a decreasing trend. We then derived the point-source luminosity ($L_{PSF}$) and showed that $f_{merg}$ monotonically increases as a function of $L_{PSF}$ at z<0.9, with $f_{merg}>$50% for $L_{PSF}>2\,10^{43}$ erg/s. At z>0.9, $f_{merg}$ rises as a function of $L_{PSF}$, though mergers do not dominate until $L_{PSF}=10^{45}$ erg/s. For X-ray and spectroscopic AGN, we computed $L_{bol}$, which has a positive correlation with $f_{merg}$ for X-ray AGN, while shows a less pronounced trend for spectroscopic AGN due to the smaller sample size. At $L_{bol}>10^{45}$ erg/s, AGN mostly reside in mergers. We concluded that mergers are strongly linked to the most powerful, dust-obscured AGN, associated with rapid supermassive black hole growth.         |

|**Abstract**|            Active galactic nuclei (AGN) play a key role in galaxy evolution but are challenging to identify due to their varied observational signatures. Furthermore, understanding their impact requires quantifying their strength relative to their host galaxies. We developed a deep learning (DL) model for identifying AGN in imaging data by deriving the contribution of the central point source. Trained on Euclidised mock galaxy images with injected AGN levels, in the form of varying contributions of the point-spread function (PSF), our model can precisely and accurately recover the injected AGN contribution fraction $f_{\rm PSF}$, with a mean difference between the predicted and true $f_{\rm PSF}$ of $-0.0078$ and an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.051. This method moves beyond binary AGN classification, enabling precise AGN contribution measurements. Applying our model to a stellar-mass-limited sample ($M_{\ast} \ge 10^{9.8} M_{\odot}$, $0.5 \le z \le 2.0$) from the first \Euclid quick data release (Q1), we identify $48,840 \pm 78$ AGN over 63.1 deg$^2$ ($7.8\pm0.1$%) using a threshold of $f_{\rm PSF} > 0.2$. We compare our DL-selected AGN with those identified in X-ray, mid-infrared (MIR), and optical spectroscopy and investigate their overlapping fractions depending on different thresholds on the PSF contribution. We find that the overlap increases with increasing X-ray or bolometric AGN luminosity. The AGN luminosity in the $I_{\rm E}$ filter correlates with host galaxy stellar mass, suggesting faster supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth in more massive galaxies. Moreover, the mean relative contribution of the AGN is higher in quiescent galaxies than in star-forming ones. Starburst galaxies and the most massive galaxies (across the star-formation main sequence) tend to host the most luminous AGN, indicating concomitant assembly of the SMBH and the host galaxy.         |

|**Abstract**|            Red quasars constitute an important but elusive phase in the evolution of supermassive black holes, where dust obscuration can significantly alter their observed properties. They have broad emission lines, like other quasars, but their optical continuum emission is significantly reddened, which is why they were traditionally identified based on near- and mid-infrared selection criteria. This work showcases the capability of the \Euclid space telescope to find a large sample of red quasars, using \Euclid near infrared (NIR) photometry. We first conduct a forecast analysis, comparing a synthetic catalogue of red QSOs with COSMOS2020. Using template fitting, we reconstruct \Euclid-like photometry for the COSMOS sources and identify a sample of candidates in a multidimensional colour-colour space achieving $98\%$ completeness for mock red QSOs with $30\%$ contaminants. To refine our selection function, we implement a probabilistic Random Forest classifier, and use UMAP visualisation to disentangle non-linear features in colour-space, reaching $98\%$ completeness and $88\%$ purity. A preliminary analysis of the candidates in the \Euclid Deep Field Fornax (EDF-F) shows that, compared to VISTA+DECAm-based colour selection criteria, \Euclid's superior depth, resolution and optical-to-NIR coverage improves the identification of the reddest, most obscured sources. Notably, the \Euclid exquisite resolution in the $I_E$ filter unveils the presence of a candidate dual quasar system, highlighting the potential for this mission to contribute to future studies on the population of dual AGN. The resulting catalogue of candidates, including more the 150 000 sources, provides a first census of red quasars in \Euclid Q1 and sets the groundwork for future studies in the Euclid Wide Survey (EWS), including spectral follow-up analyses and host morphology characterisation.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a catalogue of candidate active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the $Euclid$ Quick Release (Q1) fields. For each $Euclid$ source we collect multi-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy information from Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), $Gaia$, Dark Energy Survey (DES), Wise-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), $Spitzer$, Dark Energy Survey (DESI), and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), including spectroscopic redshift from public compilations. We investigate the AGN contents of the Q1 fields by applying selection criteria using $Euclid$ colours and WISE-AllWISE cuts finding respectively 292,222 and 65,131 candidates. We also create a high-purity QSO catalogue based on $Gaia$ DR3 information containing 1971 candidates. Furthermore, we utilise the collected spectroscopic information from DESI to perform broad-line and narrow-line AGN selections, leading to a total of 4392 AGN candidates in the Q1 field. We investigate and refine the Q1 probabilistic random forest QSO population, selecting a total of 180,666 candidates. Additionally, we perform SED fitting on a subset of sources with available $z_{\text{spec}}$, and by utilizing the derived AGN fraction, we identify a total of 7766 AGN candidates. We discuss purity and completeness of the selections and define two new colour selection criteria ($JH$_$I_{\text{E}}Y$ and $I_{\text{E}}H$_$gz$) to improve on purity, finding 313,714 and 267,513 candidates respectively in the Q1 data. We find a total of 229,779 AGN candidates equivalent to an AGN surface density of 3641 deg$^{-2}$ for $18<I_{\text{E}}\leq 24.5$, and a subsample of 30,422 candidates corresponding to an AGN surface density of 482 deg$^{-2}$ when limiting the depth to $18<I_{\text{E}}\leq 22$. The surface density of AGN recovered from this work is in line with predictions based on the AGN X-ray luminosity functions.         |

|**Abstract**|            Light emission from galaxies exhibit diverse brightness profiles, influenced by factors such as galaxy type, structural features and interactions with other galaxies. Elliptical galaxies feature more uniform light distributions, while spiral and irregular galaxies have complex, varied light profiles due to their structural heterogeneity and star-forming activity. In addition, galaxies with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) feature intense, concentrated emission from gas accretion around supermassive black holes, superimposed on regular galactic light, while quasi-stellar objects (QSO) are the extreme case of the AGN emission dominating the galaxy. The challenge of identifying AGN and QSO has been discussed many times in the literature, often requiring multi-wavelength observations. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify AGN and QSO from a single image. Diffusion models have been recently developed in the machine-learning literature to generate realistic-looking images of everyday objects. Utilising the spatial resolving power of the Euclid VIS images, we created a diffusion model trained on one million sources, without using any source pre-selection or labels. The model learns to reconstruct light distributions of normal galaxies, since the population is dominated by them. We condition the prediction of the central light distribution by masking the central few pixels of each source and reconstruct the light according to the diffusion model. We further use this prediction to identify sources that deviate from this profile by examining the reconstruction error of the few central pixels regenerated in each source's core. Our approach, solely using VIS imaging, features high completeness compared to traditional methods of AGN and QSO selection, including optical, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and X-rays.

|**Abstract**|            Our understanding of cosmic star-formation at $z>3$ used to largely rely on rest-frame UV observations. However, these observations overlook dusty and massive sources, resulting in an incomplete census of early star-forming galaxies. Recently, infrared data from Spitzer and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed a hidden population at $z\sim$3-6 with extreme red colours. Taking advantage of the overlap between imaging in the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs), covering $\sim$ 60 deg$^2$, and ancillary Spitzer observations, we identified 27000 extremely red objects with $H_E-$IRAC2>2.25 (dubbed HIEROs) down to a $10\sigma$ completeness magnitude limit of IRAC2 $=$ 22.5 AB. After a visual inspection to discard artefacts and objects with troubling photometry, we ended up with a final sample of 3900 candidates. We retrieved the physical parameter estimates for these objects from the SED-fitting tool CIGALE. Our results confirm that HIERO galaxies may populate the high-mass end of the stellar mass function at $z>3$, with some reaching extreme stellar masses ($M_*>10^{11}M_\odot$) and exhibiting high dust attenuation ($A_V>3$). However, we consider stellar mass estimates unreliable for $z>3.5$, favouring a lower-z solution. The challenges faced by SED-fitting tools in characterising these objects highlight the need for further studies, incorporating shorter-wavelength and spectroscopic data. Euclid spectra will help resolve degeneracies and better constrain the physical properties of the brightest galaxies. Given the extreme nature of this population, characterising these sources is crucial for understanding galaxy evolution. This work demonstrates Euclid's potential to provide statistical samples of rare, massive, dust-obscured galaxies at $z>3$, which will be prime targets for JWST, ALMA, and ELT.         |

|**Abstract**|            Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revealed a population of sources with a compact morphology and a `v-shaped' continuum, namely blue at rest-frame $\lambda<4000$A and red at longer wavelengths. The nature of these sources, called `little red dots' (LRDs), is still debated, since it is unclear if they host active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their number seems to drastically drop at z<4. We utilise the 63 $deg^2$ covered by the quick Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) to extend the search for LRDs to brighter magnitudes and to lower z than what has been possible with JWST to have a broader view of the evolution of this peculiar galaxy population. The selection is done by fitting the available photometric data (Euclid, Spitzer/IRAC, and ground-based griz data) with two power laws, to retrieve the rest-frame optical and UV slopes consistently over a large redshift range (i.e, z<7.6). We exclude extended objects and possible line emitters, and perform a visual inspection to remove imaging artefacts. The final selection includes 3341 LRD candidates from z=0.33 to z=3.6, with 29 detected in IRAC. Their rest-frame UV luminosity function, in contrast with previous JWST studies, shows that the number density of LRD candidates increases from high-z down to z=1.5-2.5 and decreases at even lower z. Less evolution is apparent focusing on the subsample of more robust LRD candidates having IRAC detections, which is affected by low statistics and limited by the IRAC resolution. The comparison with previous quasar UV luminosity functions shows that LRDs are not the dominant AGN population at z<4. Follow-up studies of these LRD candidates are key to confirm their nature, probe their physical properties and check for their compatibility with JWST sources, since the different spatial resolution and wavelength coverage of Euclid and JWST could select different samples of compact sources.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a catalogue of 497 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses in the Euclid Quick Release 1 data (63 deg$^2$). In the initial 0.45\% of Euclid's surveys, we double the total number of known lens candidates with space-based imaging. Our catalogue includes 250 grade A candidates, the vast majority of which (243) were previously unpublished. Euclid's resolution reveals rare lens configurations of scientific value including double-source-plane lenses, edge-on lenses, complete Einstein rings, and quadruply-imaged lenses. We resolve lenses with small Einstein radii ($\theta_{\rm E} < \ang{;;1}$) in large numbers for the first time. These lenses are found through an initial sweep by deep learning models, followed by Space Warps citizen scientist inspection, expert vetting, and system-by-system modelling. Our search approach scales straightforwardly to Euclid Data Release 1 and, without changes, would yield approximately 7000 high-confidence (grade A or B) lens candidates by late 2026. Further extrapolating to the complete Euclid Wide Survey implies a likely yield of over 100000 high-confidence candidates, transforming strong lensing science.         |

|**Abstract**|            Strong gravitational lensing has the potential to provide a powerful probe of astrophysics and cosmology, but fewer than 1000 strong lenses have been confirmed previously. With \ang{;;0.16} resolution covering a third of the sky, the \Euclid telescope will revolutionise strong lens finding, with \num{170000} lenses forecasted to be discovered amongst its 1.5 billion galaxies. We present an analysis of the performance of five machine-learning models at finding strong gravitational lenses in the quick release of \Euclid data (Q1), covering 63\,deg$^{2}$. The models are validated with citizen scientists and expert visual inspection. We focus on the best performing network: a fine-tuned version of the \texttt{Zoobot} pretrained model, originally trained to classify galaxy morphologies in heterogeneous astronomical imaging surveys. Of the one million Q1 objects that \texttt{Zoobot} was tasked to find strong lenses within, the top 1000 ranked objects contained 122 grade A lenses (almost certain lenses), and 41 grade B lenses (probable lenses). A deeper search with the five networks combined with visual inspection discovered 250 (247) grade A (B) lenses, of which 224 (182) are ranked in the top \num{20000} by \texttt{Zoobot}. When extrapolated to the full \Euclid survey, the highest ranked one million images will contain \num{75000} grade A or B strong gravitational lenses.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) is expected to identify of order $100\,000$ galaxy-galaxy strong lenses across $14\,000$deg$^2$. The Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) of $63.1$deg$^2$ Euclid images provides an excellent opportunity to test our lens-finding ability, and to verify the anticipated lens frequency in the EWS. Following the Q1 data release, eight machine learning networks from five teams were applied to approximately one million images. This was followed by a citizen science inspection of a subset of around $100\,000$ images, of which $65\%$ received high network scores, with the remainder randomly selected. The top scoring outputs were inspected by experts to establish confident (grade A), likely (grade B), possible (grade C), and unlikely lenses. In this paper we combine the citizen science and machine learning classifiers into an ensemble, demonstrating that a combined approach can produce a purer and more complete sample than the original individual classifiers. Using the expert-graded subset as ground truth, we find that this ensemble can provide a purity of $52\pm2\%$ (grade A/B lenses) with $50\%$ completeness (for context, due to the rarity of lenses a random classifier would have a purity of $0.05\%$). We discuss future lessons for the first major Euclid data release (DR1), where the big-data challenges will become more significant and will require analysing more than $\sim300$ million galaxies, and thus time investment of both experts and citizens must be carefully managed.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Euclid mission aims to survey around 14000 deg^{2} of extragalactic sky, providing around 10^{5} gravitational lens images. Modelling of gravitational lenses is fundamental to estimate the total mass of the lens galaxy, along with its dark matter content. Traditional modelling of gravitational lenses is computationally intensive and requires manual input. In this paper, we use a Bayesian neural network, LEns MOdelling with Neural networks (LEMON), for modelling Euclid gravitational lenses with a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass profile. Our method estimates key lens mass profile parameters, such as the Einstein radius, while also predicting the light parameters of foreground galaxies and their uncertainties. We validate LEMON's performance on both mock Euclid data sets, real Euclidised lenses observed with Hubble Space Telescope (hereafter HST), and real Euclid lenses found in the Perseus ERO field, demonstrating the ability of LEMON to predict parameters of both simulated and real lenses. Results show promising accuracy and reliability in predicting the Einstein radius, axis ratio, position angle, effective radius, Sérsic index, and lens magnitude for simulated lens galaxies. The application to real data, including the latest Quick Release 1 strong lens candidates, provides encouraging results, particularly for the Einstein radius. We also verified that LEMON has the potential to accelerate traditional modelling methods, by giving to the classical optimiser the LEMON predictions as starting points, resulting in a speed-up of up to 26 times the original time needed to model a sample of gravitational lenses, a result that would be impossible with randomly initialised guesses. This work represents a significant step towards efficient, automated gravitational lens modelling, which is crucial for handling the large data volumes expected from Euclid.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the first catalogue of strong lensing galaxy clusters identified in the Euclid Quick Release 1 observations (covering $63.1\,\mathrm{deg^2}$). This catalogue is the result of the visual inspection of 1260 cluster fields. Each galaxy cluster was ranked with a probability, $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{lens}}$, based on the number and plausibility of the identified strong lensing features. Specifically, we identified 83 gravitational lenses with $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{lens}}>0.5$, of which 14 have $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{lens}}=1$, and clearly exhibiting secure strong lensing features, such as giant tangential and radial arcs, and multiple images. Considering the measured number density of lensing galaxy clusters, approximately $0.3\,\mathrm{deg}^{-2}$ for $\mathcal{P}_{\mathrm{lens}}>0.9$, we predict that \Euclid\ will likely see more than 4500 strong lensing clusters over the course of the mission. Notably, only three of the identified cluster-scale lenses had been previously observed from space. Thus, \Euclid has provided the first high-resolution imaging for the remaining $80$ galaxy cluster lenses, including those with the highest probability. The identified strong lensing features will be used for training deep-learning models for identifying gravitational arcs and multiple images automatically in \Euclid observations. This study confirms the huge potential of \Euclid for finding new strong lensing clusters, enabling exciting new discoveries on the nature of dark matter and dark energy and the study of the high-redshift Universe.         |

|**Abstract**|            The matter distribution around galaxy clusters is distributed over several filaments, reflecting their positions as nodes in the large-scale cosmic web. The number of filaments connected to a cluster, namely its connectivity, is expected to affect the physical properties of clusters. Using the first Euclid galaxy catalogue from the Euclid Quick Release 1 (Q1), we investigate the connectivity of galaxy clusters and how it correlates with their physical and galaxy member properties. Around 220 clusters located within the three fields of Q1 (covering $\sim 63 \ \text{deg}^2$), are analysed in the redshift range $0.2 < z < 0.7$. Due to the photometric redshift uncertainty, we reconstruct the cosmic web skeleton, and measure cluster connectivity, in 2-D projected slices with a thickness of 170 comoving $h^{-1}.\text{Mpc}$ and centred on each cluster redshift, by using two different filament finder algorithms on the most massive galaxies ($M_*\ > 10^{10.3} \ M_\odot$). In agreement with previous measurements, we recover the mass-connectivity relation independently of the filament detection algorithm, showing that the most massive clusters are, on average, connected to a larger number of cosmic filaments, consistent with hierarchical structure formation models. Furthermore, we explore possible correlations between connectivities and two cluster properties: the fraction of early-type galaxies and the Sérsic index of galaxy members. Our result suggests that the clusters populated by early-type galaxies exhibit higher connectivity compared to clusters dominated by late-type galaxies. These preliminary investigations highlight our ability to quantify the impact of the cosmic web connectivity on cluster properties with Euclid.         |

|**Abstract**|            Galaxy morphologies and shape orientations are expected to correlate with their large-scale environment, since they grow by accreting matter from the cosmic web and are subject to interactions with other galaxies. Cosmic filaments are extracted in projection from the Euclid Quick Data Release 1 (covering 63.1 $\mathrm{deg}^2$) at $0.5<z<0.9$ in tomographic slices of 170 comoving $h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ using photometric redshifts. Galaxy morphologies are accurately retrieved thanks to the excellent resolution of VIS data. The distribution of massive galaxies ($M_* > 10^{10} M_\odot$) in the projected cosmic web is analysed as a function of morphology measured from VIS data. Specifically, the 2D alignment of galaxy shapes with large-scale filaments is quantified as a function of Sérsic indices and masses. We find the known trend that more massive galaxies are closer to filament spines. At fixed stellar masses, morphologies correlate both with densities and distances to large-scale filaments. In addition, the large volume of this data set allows us to detect a signal indicating that there is a preferential alignment of the major axis of massive early-type galaxies along projected cosmic filaments. Overall, these results demonstrate our capabilities to carry out detailed studies of galaxy environments with Euclid, which will be extended to higher redshift and lower stellar masses with the future Euclid Deep Survey.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report on serendipitous \Euclid observations of previously known transients, using the \Euclid Q1 data release. By cross-matching with the Transient Name Server (TNS) we identify 164 transients that coincide with the data release. Although the \Euclid Q1 release only includes single-epoch data, we are able to make \Euclid photometric measurements at the location of 161 of these transients. \Euclid obtained deep photometric measurements or upper limits of these transients in the \IE, \YE, \JE, and \HE bands at various phases of the transient light-curves, including before, during, and after the observations of ground-based transient surveys. Approximately 70\% of known transients reported in the six months before the \Euclid observation date and with discovery magnitude brighter than 24 were detected in \Euclid $\IE$ images. Our observations include one of the earliest near-infrared detections of a Type~Ia supernova (SN~2024pvw) 15~days prior to its peak brightness, and the late-phase (435.9~days post peak) observations of the enigmatic core-collapse SN~2023aew. \Euclid deep photometry provides valuable information on the nature of these transients such as their progenitor systems and power sources, with late time observations being a uniquely powerful contribution. In addition, \Euclid is able to detect the host galaxies of some transients that were previously classed as hostless. The Q1 data demonstrate the power of the \Euclid data even with only single-epoch observations available, as will be the case for much larger areas of sky in the Euclid Wide Survey.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Euclid Q1 fields were selected for calibration purposes in cosmology and are therefore relatively devoid of nearby galaxies. However, this is precisely what makes them interesting fields in which to search for dwarf galaxies in local density environments. We take advantage of the unprecedented depth, spatial resolution, and field of view of the Euclid Quick Release (Q1) to build a census of dwarf galaxies in these regions. We have identified dwarfs in a representative sample of 25 contiguous tiles in the Euclid Deep Field North (EDF-N), covering an area of 14.25 sq. deg. The dwarf candidates were identified using a semi-automatic detection method, based on properties measured by the Euclid pipeline and listed in the MER catalogue. A selection cut in surface brightness and magnitude was used to produce an initial dwarf candidate catalogue, followed by a cut in morphology and colour. This catalogue was visually classified to produce a final sample of dwarf candidates, including their morphology, number of nuclei, globular cluster (GC) richness, and presence of a blue compact centre. We identified 2674 dwarf candidates, corresponding to 188 dwarfs per sq. deg. The visual classification of the dwarfs reveals a slightly uneven morphological mix of 58% ellipticals and 42% irregulars, with very few potentially GC-rich (1.0%) and nucleated (4.0%) candidates but a noticeable fraction (6.9%) of dwarfs with blue compact centres. The distance distribution of 388 (15%) of the dwarfs with spectroscopic redshifts peaks at about 400 Mpc. Their stellar mass distribution confirms that our selection effectively identifies dwarfs while minimising contamination. The most prominent dwarf overdensities are dominated by dEs, while dIs are more evenly distributed. This work highlights Euclid's remarkable ability to detect and characterise dwarf galaxies across diverse masses, distances, and environments.         |

|**Abstract**|            The atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters are unique compared to other planets because of the presence of both refractory and volatile gaseous species, enabling a new lens to constrain a planet's composition, chemistry, and formation. WASP-178b is one such ultra-hot Jupiter that was recently found to exhibit enormous NUV absorption between 0.2 and 0.4 $\mu$m from some combination of Fe+, Mg, and SiO. Here, we present new infrared observations of WASP-178b with HST/WFC3 and JWST/NIRSpec/G395H, providing novel measurements of the volatile species H$_2$O and CO in WASP-178b's atmosphere. Atmospheric retrievals find a range of compositional interpretations depending on which dataset is retrieved, the type of chemistry assumed, and the temperature structure parametrization used due to the combined effects of thermal dissociation, the lack of volatile spectral features besides H$_2$O and CO, and the relative weakness of H$_2$O and CO themselves. Taken together with a new state-of-the-art characterization of the host star, our retrieval analyses suggests a solar to super-solar [O/H] and [Si/H], but sub-solar [C/H], perhaps suggesting rock-laden atmospheric enrichment near the H$_2$O iceline. To obtain meaningful abundance constraints for this planet, it was essential to combine the JWST IR data with short-wavelength HST observations, highlighting the ongoing synergy between the two facilities.         |

|**Abstract**|            Understanding what environmental conditions prevailed on early Earth during the Hadean eon, and how this set the stage for the origins of life, remains a challenge. Geologic processes such as serpentinization and bombardment by chondritic material during the late veneer might have been very active, shaping an atmospheric composition reducing enough to allow efficient photochemical synthesis of HCN, one of the key precursors of prebiotic molecules. HCN can rain out and accumulate in warm little ponds (WLPs), forming prebiotic molecules such as nucleobases and the sugar ribose. These molecules could condense to nucleotides, the building blocks of RNA molecules, one of the ingredients of life. Here, we perform a systematic study of potential sources of reducing gases on Hadean Earth and calculate the concentrations of prebiotic molecules in WLPs based on a comprehensive geophysical and atmospheric model. We find that in a reduced H$_2$-dominated atmosphere, carbonaceous bombardment can produce enough HCN to reach maximum WLP concentrations of $\sim 1-10\,\mathrm{mM}$ for nucleobases and, in the absence of seepage, $\sim 10-100\,\mathrm{\mu M}$ for ribose. If the Hadean atmosphere was initially oxidized and CO$_2$-rich ($90\,\%$), we find serpentinization alone can reduce the atmosphere, resulting in WLP concentrations of an order of magnitude lower than the reducing carbonaceous bombardment case. In both cases, concentrations are sufficient for nucleotide synthesis, as shown in experimental studies. RNA could have appeared on Earth immediately after it became habitable (about $100\,\mathrm{Myr}$ after the Moon-forming impact), or it could have (re)appeared later at any time up to the beginning of the Archean.         |

|**Abstract**|            The very wide binary asteroid (VWBA) population is a small subset of the population of known binary and multiple asteroids made of systems with very widely orbiting satellites and long orbital periods, on the order of tens to hundreds of days. The origin of these systems is debatable, and most members of this population are poorly characterized. We have compiled all available high-angular resolution imaging archival data of VWBA systems from large ground- and space-based telescopes. We measure the astrometric positions of the satellite relative to the primary and analyze the dynamics of the satellites using the Genoid genetic algorithm. Additionally, we use a NEATM thermal model to estimate the diameters of two systems, and we model the orbit of Litva's inner satellite using photometric lightcurve observations. We determine the effective diameters of binary systems Christophedumas and Alconrad to be 4.7 + 0.4km and 5.2 + 0.3km respectively. We determine new orbital solutions for five systems, Huenna, Litva, (3548) Eurybates, Pauling, and Alconrad. We find a significantly eccentric best-fit orbital solution for the outer satellite of Litva, a moderately eccentric solution for Alconrad, and a nearly circular solution for Pauling. We also confirm previously reported orbital solutions for (379) Huenna and Eurybates. It is unlikely that BYORP expansion could be solely responsible for the formation of VWBAs. It is possible that the satellites of these systems were formed through YORP spin-up and then later scattered onto very wide orbits. Additionally, we find that some members of the population are unlikely to have formed satellites through YORP spin-up, and a collisional formation history is favored. In particular, this applies to VWBAs within large dynamical families, or large VWBA systems such as Huenna and NASA's Lucy mission target Eurybates.         |

|**Abstract**|            The {\em B}-field Orion Protostellar Survey (BOPS) recently obtained polarimetric observations at 870 ${\rm \mu m}$ towards 61 protostars in the Orion molecular clouds with $\sim 1^{\prime\prime}$ spatial resolution using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. From the BOPS sample, we selected the 26 protostars with extended polarized emission within a radius of $\sim 6^{\prime\prime}$ (2400~au) around the protostar. This allows to have sufficient statistical polarization data to infer the magnetic field strength. The magnetic field strength is derived using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The underlying magnetic field strengths are approximately 2.0~mG for protostars with a standard hourglass magnetic field morphology, which is higher than the values derived for protostars with rotated hourglass, spiral, and complex magnetic field configurations ($\lesssim1.0$~mG). This suggests that the magnetic field plays a more significant role in envelopes exhibiting a standard hourglass field morphology, and a value of $\gtrsim2.0$ mG would be required to maintain such a structure at these scales. Furthermore, most protostars in the sample are slightly supercritical, with mass-to-flux ratios $\lesssim3.0$. In particular, the mass-to-flux ratios for all protostars with a standard hourglass magnetic field morphology are lower than 3.0. However, these ratios do not account for the contribution of the protostellar mass, which means they are likely significantly underestimated.         |

|**Abstract**|            The study of radio emission in starburst dwarf galaxies provides a unique opportunity to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the amplification and transport of magnetic fields. Local dwarfs are often considered proxies for early-Universe galaxies, so this study may provide insights into the role of non-thermal components in the formation and evolution of larger galaxies. By investigating the radio continuum spectra and maps of the starburst dwarf galaxies, we aim to draw conclusions on their magnetic field strengths and configurations, as well as the dynamics of cosmic ray (CR) transport. We perform a radio continuum polarimetry study of two of the brightest starburst IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample (RBGS) dwarf galaxies, NGC 3125 and IC 4662. By combining data of the Australian Telescope Compact Array (2.1 GHz) and MeerKAT (1.28 GHz), we analyse the underlying emission mechanism and the CR transport in these systems. We find flat spectra in those dwarf galaxies over the entire investigated frequency range, which sharply contrasts with observations of massive spiral galaxies. Because the expected cooling time of CR electrons is much shorter than their escape time, we would expect a steepened steady-state CR electron spectrum. The flat observed spectra suggest a substantial contribution from free-free emission at high frequencies and absorption at low frequencies, which may solve this puzzle. For NGC 3125, we measure a degree of polarisation between 0.75% and 2.6%, implying a turbulent field and supporting the picture of a comparably large thermal emission component that could be sourced by stellar radiation feedback and supernovae.         |

|**Abstract**|            The ESA Euclid mission will measure the photometric redshifts of billions of galaxies in order to provide an accurate 3D view of the Universe at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Photometric redshifts are determined by the PHZ processing function on the basis of the multi-wavelength photometry of Euclid and ground-based observations. In this paper, we describe the PHZ processing used for the Euclid Quick Data Release, the output products, and their validation. The PHZ pipeline is responsible for the following main tasks: source classification into star, galaxy, and QSO classes based on photometric colours; determination of photometric redshifts and of physical properties of galaxies. The classification is able to provide a star sample with a high level of purity, a highly complete galaxy sample, and reliable probabilities of belonging to those classes. The identification of QSOs is more problematic: photometric information seems to be insufficient to accurately separate QSOs from galaxies. The performance of the pipeline in the determination of photometric redshifts has been tested using the COSMOS2020 catalogue and a large sample of spectroscopic redshifts. The results are in line with expectations: the precision of the estimates are compatible with Euclid requirements, while, as expected, a bias correction is needed to achieve the accuracy level required for the cosmological probes. Finally, the pipeline provides reliable estimates of the physical properties of galaxies, in good agreement with findings from the COSMOS2020 catalogue, except for an unrealistically large fraction of very young galaxies with very high specific star-formation rates. The application of appropriate priors is, however, sufficient to obtain reliable physical properties for those problematic objects. We present several areas for improvement for future Euclid data releases.         |
