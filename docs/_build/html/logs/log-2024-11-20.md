|**Abstract**|            The interaction between radio-jets and quasar host galaxies plays a paramount role in quasar/galaxy co-evolution. However, very little has been known so far about this interaction at very high-z. Here, we present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations in Band 7 and Band 3 of six radio-loud quasars' host galaxies at $z > 5$. We recover [CII] 158 $\mu$m line and underlying dust continuum emission at $>2\sigma$ for five sources, while we obtain upper limits for the CO(6-5) emission line and continuum for the remaining source. At the spatial resolution of our observations ($\sim$1.0"-1.4"), we do not recover perturbed/extended morphologies or kinematics, signatures of potential mergers. These galaxies already host large quantities of gas, with [CII]-based star formation rates of $30-400 M_{\odot} $yr$^{-1}$. Building their radio/sub-mm spectral energy distributions (SEDs), we find that in at least four cases the 1mm continuum intensity arises from a combination of synchrotron and dust emission, with an initial estimation of synchrotron contribution at 300 GHz of $\gtrsim$10%. We compare the properties of the sources inspected here with a large collection of radio-quiet sources from the literature, as well as a sample of radio-loud quasars from previous studies, at comparable redshift. We recover a potential mild decrease in $L_{\rm [CII]}$ for the radio-loud sources, which might be due to a suppression of the cool gas emission due to the radio-jets. We do not find any [CII]-emitting companion galaxy candidate around the five radio-loud quasars observed in Band 7: given the depth of our dataset, this result is still consistent with that observed around radio-quiet quasars. Further higher-spatial resolution observations, over a larger frequency range, of high-z radio-loud quasars hosts will allow for a better understanding of the physics of such sources.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a reconstruction of the line-of-sight motions of the local interstellar medium (ISM) based on the combination of a state-of-the-art model of the three-dimensional dust density distribution within 1.25 kpc from the Sun and the HI and CO line emission within Galactic latitudes $|b| < 5^{\circ}$. We use the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) method to match the plane-of-the-sky 3D dust distribution across distances with the atomic and molecular line emission. We identify a significant correlation between the 3D dust model and the line emission. We employ this correlation to assign line-of-sight velocities to the dust across density channels and produce a face-on map of the local ISM radial motions with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR). We find that most of the material in the 3D dust model follows the large-scale pattern of Galactic rotation; however, we also report local departures from the rotation pattern with standard deviations of 12.1 and 6.1 km/s for the HI and CO line emission, respectively. The mean kinetic energy densities of these streaming motions are around 0.68 and 0.18 eV/cm$^{3}$ from either gas tracer. Assuming homogeneity and isotropy in the velocity field, these values are within a factor of a few of the total kinetic energy density. These kinetic energy values are roughly comparable to other energy densities, thus confirming the near-equipartition introduced by the feedback loops connecting the physical processes in the local ISM. Yet, we find energy and momentum overdensities of around a factor of ten concentrated in the Radcliffe Wave, the Split, and other local density structures. Although we do not find evidence of the Local Spiral Arm impact in these overdensities, their distribution suggests the influence of other large-scale effects that, in addition to supernova feedback, shape the energy distribution in the Solar neighborhood.         |

|**Abstract**|            Galaxies grow and evolve in dark matter halos. Because dark matter is not visible, galaxies' halo masses ($\rm{M}_{\rm{halo}}$) must be inferred indirectly. We present a graph neural network (GNN) model for predicting $\rm{M}_{\rm{halo}}$ from stellar mass ($\rm{M}_{*}$) in simulated galaxy clusters using data from the IllustrisTNG simulation suite. Unlike traditional machine learning models like random forests, our GNN captures the information-rich substructure of galaxy clusters by using spatial and kinematic relationships between galaxy neighbour. A GNN model trained on the TNG-Cluster dataset and independently tested on the TNG300 simulation achieves superior predictive performance compared to other baseline models we tested. Future work will extend this approach to different simulations and real observational datasets to further validate the GNN model's ability to generalise.         |

|**Abstract**|            It is widely assumed that dust opacities in molecular clouds follow a power-law profile with an index, $\beta$. Recent studies of the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC) 2/3 complex, however, show a flattening in the spectral energy distribution (SED) at $ \lambda > 2$ mm implying non-constant indices on scales $\gtrsim$ 0.08 pc. The origin of this flattening is not yet known but it may be due to the intrinsic properties of the dust grains or contamination from other sources of emission. We investigate the SED slopes in OMC 2/3 further using observations of six protostellar cores with NOEMA from 2.9 mm to 3.6 mm and ALMA-ACA in Band 4 (1.9 -- 2.1 mm) and Band 5 (1.6 -- 1.8 mm) on core and envelope scales of $\sim 0.02 - 0.08$ pc. We confirm flattened opacity indices between 2.9 mm and 3.6 mm for the six cores with $\beta \approx -0.16 - 1.45$, which are notably lower than the $\beta$ values of $> 1.3$ measured for these sources on $0.08$ pc scales from single-dish data. Four sources have consistent SED slopes between the ALMA data and the NOEMA data. We propose that these sources may have a significant fraction of emission coming from large dust grains in embedded disks, which biases the emission more at longer wavelengths. Two sources, however, had inconsistent slopes between the ALMA and NOEMA data, indicating different origins of emission. These results highlight how care is needed when combining multi-scale observations or extrapolating single-band observations to other wavelengths.         |

|| <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-20*|
|*Comments*| *5 pages, 3 figures, accepted to be published in A&A Letters*|
|**Abstract**|            In this manuscript, an oversimplified model is proposed for the first time to explain the different variability trends in the observed broad H$\alpha$ emission line luminosity $L_{H\alpha}(t)$ and in the TDE model determined bolometric luminosity $L_{bol}(t)$ in the known TDE ASASSN-14li. Considering broad emission line regions (BLRs) lying into central accretion disk related to accreted materials onto central black hole in TDEs, mass evolution $M_{BLRs}(t)$ of central BLRs can be determined by the maximum mass $M_{BLRs,0}$ of central BLRs minus the corresponding accreted mass in a TDE. Meanwhile, through the simple linear dependence of Broad Balmer emission line luminosity on mass of BLRs, the mass evolution $M_{BLRs}(t)$ of central BLRs can be applied to describe the observed $L_{H\alpha}(t)$. Although the proposed model is oversimplified with only one free model parameter $M_{BLRs,0}$, the model with $M_{BLRs,0}\sim0.02{\rm M_\odot}$ can be applied to well describe the observed $L_{H\alpha}(t)$ in the TDE ASASSN-14li. Meanwhile, the oversimplified model can also be applied to roughly describe the observed $L_{H\alpha}(t)$ in the TDE ASASSN-14ae. The reasonable descriptions to the observed $L_{H\alpha}(t)$ in ASASSN-14li and ASASSN-14ae indicate the oversimplified model with only one free model parameter is probably efficient enough to describe mass evolutions of $M_{BLRs}$ related to central accreted debris in TDEs.         |
