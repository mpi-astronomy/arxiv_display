|**Abstract**| We report precise radial velocity (RV) observations of HD 212657 (= K2-167), a star shown by K2 to host a transiting sub-Neptune-sized planet in a 10 day orbit. Using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry, we refined the planet parameters, especially the orbital period. We collected 74 precise RVs with the HARPS-N spectrograph between August 2015 and October 2016. Although this planet was first found to transit in 2015 and validated in 2018, excess RV scatter originally limited mass measurements. Here, we measure a mass by taking advantage of reductions in scatter from updates to the HARPS-N Data Reduction System (2.3.5) and our new activity mitigation method called CCF Activity Linear Model (CALM), which uses activity-induced line shape changes in the spectra without requiring timing information. Using the CALM framework, we performed a joint fit with RVs and transits using EXOFASTv2 and find $M_p = 6.3_{-1.4}^{+1.4}$ $M_{\oplus}$ and $R_p = 2.33^{+0.17}_{-0.15}$ $R_{\oplus}$, which places K2-167 b at the upper edge of the radius valley. We also find hints of a secondary companion at a $\sim$ 22 day period, but confirmation requires additional RVs. Although characterizing lower-mass planets like K2-167 b is often impeded by stellar variability, these systems especially help probe the formation physics (i.e. photoevaporation, core-powered mass loss) of the radius valley. In the future, CALM or similar techniques could be widely applied to FGK-type stars, help characterize a population of exoplanets surrounding the radius valley, and further our understanding of their formation. |

|**Abstract**| From Nov. 2019 to May 2020, the red supergiant star Betelgeuse experienced an unprecedented drop of brightness in the visible domain called the great dimming event. Large atmospheric dust clouds and large photospheric convective features are suspected to be responsible for it. To better understand the dimming event, we used mid-infrared long-baseline spectro-interferometric measurements of Betelgeuse taken with the VLTI/MATISSE instrument before (Dec. 2018), during (Feb. 2020), and after (Dec. 2020) the GDE. We present data in the 3.98 to 4.15\,$\mu$m range to cover SiO spectral features molecules as well as adjacent continuum. We have employed geometrical models, image reconstruction, as well as radiative transfer models to monitor the spatial distribution of SiO over the stellar surface. We find a strongly in-homogeneous spatial distribution of SiO that appears to be looking very different between our observing epochs, indicative of a vigorous activity in the stellar atmosphere. The contrast of our images is small in the pseudo-continuum for all epochs, implying that our MATISSE observations support both cold spot and dust cloud model. |

|**Abstract**| The hot subdwarf O/B stars (sdO/Bs) are known as extreme horizontal branch stars, which is of great importance in stellar evolution theory. The sdO/Bs are generally thought to have a helium-burning core and a thin hydrogen envelope $(M_{\rm env }<0.02M_\odot)$. In the canonical binary evolution scenario, sdO/Bs are considered to be the stripped cores of red giants. However, such a scenario cannot explain the recently discovered sdO/B binary, SMSS J1920, where the strong Ca H$\&$K lines in the spectrum are found. It suggests that this binary is likely originated from the recent ejection of common envelope (CE). In this {work}, we proposed a new formation channel of massive sdO/Bs, namely sdO/Bs produced from a CE ejection process with an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star (hereafter AGB CE channel). We constructed the evolutionary model of sdO/Bs and successfully explained most of the important observed parameters of the sdO/B star in SMSS J1920, including the evolutionary age, sdO/B mass, effective temperature, surface gravity and surface helium abundance. The minimum sdO/B mass produced from the AGB CE channel is about $0.48M_\odot$. The evolutionary tracks in $\log T_{\rm eff}-\log g$ plane {may explain a fraction of the observational samples} with high-$\log T_{\rm eff}$ and low-$\log g$. Considering wind mass-loss of sdO/Bs, the model could produce helium-rich hot subdwarfs with $\log (n_{\rm He}/n_{\rm H})\gtrsim-1$. |

|**Abstract**| Recent stellar occultations allowed accurate instantaneous size and apparent shape determinations of the large Kuiper belt object (50000) Quaoar and detected two rings with spatially variable optical depth. In this paper we present new visible range light curve data of Quaoar from the Kepler/K2 mission, and thermal light curves at 100 and 160\,$\mu$m obtained with Herschel/PACS. K2 data provide a single-peaked period of 8.88 h, very close to the previously determined 8.84 h, and it favours an asymmetric double-peaked light curve with 17.76 h period. We clearly detected a thermal light curve with relative amplitudes of $\sim$10% both at 100 and 160 $\mu$m. A detailed thermophysical modeling of the system shows that the measurements can be best fitted with a triaxial ellipsoid shape, with a volume-equivalent diameter of 1090 km, and axis ratios of a/b = 1.19, and b/c = 1.16. This shape matches the published occultation shape, as well as visual and thermal light curve data. The radiometric size uncertainty remains relatively large ($\pm$40 km) as the ring and satellite contributions to the system-integrated flux densities are unknown. In the less likely case of negligible ring/satellite contributions, Quaoar would have a size above 1100 km and a thermal inertia $\leq$ 10 Jm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$s$^{-1/2}$. A large and dark Weywot in combination with a possible ring contribution would lead to a size below 1080 km in combination with a thermal inertia $\gtrsim$ 10 Jm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$s$^{-1/2}$, notably higher than that of smaller Kuiper belt objects with similar albedo and colours. We find that Quaoar's density is in the range 1.67-1.77 g/cm$^3$ significantly lower than previous estimates. This density value fits very well to the relationship observed between the size and density of the largest Kuiper belt objects. |

|**Abstract**| Faint, star-forming galaxies likely play a dominant role in cosmic reionisation. Strides have been made in recent years to characterise these populations at high redshifts ($z>3$). Now for the first time, with JWST photometry beyond 1$\,\mu m$ in the rest frame, we can derive accurate stellar masses and position these galaxies on the galaxy main sequence. We seek to assess the place of 96 individual Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) selected behind the A2744 lensing cluster with MUSE spectroscopy on the galaxy main sequence. We also compare derived stellar masses to Lyman-alpha luminosities and equivalent widths to better quantify the relationship between the Lyman-alpha emission and the host galaxy. These 96 LAEs lie in the redshift range $2.9<z<6.7$, and their range of masses extends down to $10^6\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ (over half with $\mathrm{M_{\star}}<10^8\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$). We use the JWST/NIRCam and HST photometric catalogs from the UNCOVER project, giving us excellent wavelength coverage from $450\,\mathrm{nm}$ to $4.5\,\mu m$. We find a main sequence relation for these low mass LAEs of the form: $\mathrm{log\,SFR}=(0.88\pm0.07 - 0.030\pm0.027\times t)\,\mathrm{log\,M_{\star}} - ( 6.31\pm0.41 - 0.08\pm0.37\times t)$. This is in approximate agreement with best-fits of previous collated studies, however, with a steeper slope and a higher normalisation. This indicates that low-mass LAEs towards the epoch of reionisation lie above typical literature main sequence relations derived at lower redshift and higher masses. Additionally, comparing our results to UV-selected samples, we see that while low-mass LAEs lie above these typical main sequence relations, they are likely not singular in this respect at these masses and redshifts. While low-mass galaxies have been shown to play a significant role in cosmic reionisation, our results point to no special position for LAEs in this regard. |
