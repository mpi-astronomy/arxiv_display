|**Abstract**| The astronomical transient AT2018cow is the closest example of the new class of luminous, fast blue optical transients (FBOTs). Liverpool Telescope RINGO3 observations of AT2018cow are reported here, which constitute the earliest polarimetric observations of an FBOT. At 5.7 days post-explosion, the optical emission of AT2018cow exhibited a chromatic polarization spike that reached ~7% at red wavelengths. This is the highest intrinsic polarization recorded for a non-relativistic explosive transient, and is observed in multiple bands and at multiple epochs over the first night of observations, before rapidly declining. The apparent wavelength dependence of the polarization may arise through depolarization or dilution of the polarized flux, due to conditions in AT~2018cow at early times. A second ``bump" in the polarization is observed at blue wavelengths at ~12 days. Such a high polarization requires an extremely aspherical geometry that is only apparent for a brief period (<1 day), such as shock breakout through an optically thick disk. For a disk-like configuration, the ratio of the thickness to radial extent must be ~10%. |

|**Abstract**| The brightest Gamma-ray burst, GRB 221009A, has spurred numerous theoretical investigations, with particular attention paid to the origins of ultra-high energy TeV photons during the prompt phase. However, analyzing the mechanism of radiation of photons in the $\sim$MeV range has been difficult because the high flux causes pile-up and saturation effects in most GRB detectors. In this letter, we present systematic modeling of the time-resolved spectra of the GRB using unsaturated data obtained from Fermi/GBM (precursor) and SATech-01/GECAM-C (main emission and flare). Our approach incorporates the synchrotron radiation model, which assumes an expanding emission region with relativistic speed and a global magnetic field that decays with radius, and successfully fits such a model to the observational data. Our results indicate that the spectra of the burst are fully in accordance with a synchrotron origin from relativistic electrons accelerated at a large emission radius. The lack of thermal emission in the prompt emission spectra supports a Poynting-flux-dominated jet composition. |

|**Abstract**| Because of its proximity and the large size of its black hole, M87 is one of the best targets for studying the launching mechanism of active galactic nucleus jets. Currently, magnetic fields are considered to be an essential factor in the launching and accelerating of the jet. However, current observational estimates of the magnetic field strength of the M87 jet are limited to the innermost part of the jet or to HST-1. No attempt has yet been made to measure the magnetic field strength in between. We aim to infer the magnetic field strength of the M87 jet out to a distance of several thousand $r_s$ by tracking the distance-dependent changes in the synchrotron spectrum of the jet from high-resolution very long baseline interferometry observations. In order to obtain high-quality spectral index maps, quasi-simultaneous observations at 22 and 43 GHz were conducted using the KVN and VERA Array (KaVA) and the VLBA. We compared the spectral index distributions obtained from the observations with a model and placed limits on the magnetic field strengths as a function of distance. The overall spectral morphology is broadly consistent over the course of these observations. The observed synchrotron spectrum rapidly steepens from $\alpha_{22-43 GHz}$ ~ -0.7 at ~ 2 mas to $\alpha_{22-43 GHz}$ ~ -2.5 at ~ 6 mas. A spectral index model in which nonthermal electron injections inside the jet decrease with distance can adequately reproduce the observed trend. This suggests the magnetic field strength of the jet at a distance of 2 - 10 mas (~ 900 $r_s$ - ~ 4500 $r_s$ in the deprojected distance) has a range of $B=(0.3 - 1.0 G)(z/2 mas)^{-0.73}$. Extrapolating to the EHT scale yields consistent results, suggesting that the majority of the magnetic flux of the jet near the black hole is preserved out to ~ 4500 $r_s$ without significant dissipation. |

|**Abstract**| Scientific Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (sCMOS) sensors are finding increasingly more applications in astronomical observations, thanks to their advantages over charge-coupled devices (CCDs) such as a higher readout frame rate, higher radiation tolerance, and higher working temperature. In this work, we investigate the performance at the individual pixel level of a large-format sCMOS sensor, GSENSE1516BSI, which has 4096 * 4096 pixels, each of 15 {\mu}m in size. To achieve this, three areas on the sCMOS sensor, each consisting of 99 * 99 pixels, are chosen for the experiment. The readout noise, conversion gain and energy resolutions of the individual pixels in these areas are measured from a large number (more than 25,000) of X-ray events accumulated for each of the pixels through long time exposures. The energy resolution of these pixels can reach 140 eV at 6.4 keV at room temperature and shows a significant positive correlation with the readout noise. The accurate gain can also be derived individually for each of the pixels from its X-ray spectrum obtained. Variations of the gain values are found at a level of 0.56% statistically among the 30 thousand pixels in the areas studied. With the gain of each pixel determined accurately, a precise gain correction is performed pixel by pixel in these areas, in contrast to the standardized ensemble gain used in the conventional method. In this way, we could almost completely eliminate the degradation of energy resolutions caused by gain variations among pixels. As a result, the energy resolution at room temperature can be significantly improved to 124.6 eV at 4.5 keV and 140.7 eV at 6.4 keV. This pixel-by-pixel gain correction method can be applied to all kinds of CMOS sensors, and is expected to find interesting applications in X-ray spectroscopic observations in the future. |

|**Abstract**| Obtaining high-resolution images at centimeter-or-longer wavelengths is vital for understanding the physics of jets. We reconstructed images from the M87 22 GHz data observed with the East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN) by using the regularized maximum likelihood (RML) method, which is different from the conventional imaging method CLEAN. Consequently, a bright core and jet extending about 30 mas to the northwest were detected with a higher resolution than in the CLEAN image. The width of the jet was 0.5 mas at 0.3 mas from the core, consistent with the width measured in the 86 GHz image in the previous study. In addition, three ridges were able to be detected at around 8 mas from the core, even though the peak-to-peak separation was only 1.0 mas. This indicates that the RML image's spatial resolution is at least 30% higher than that of the CLEAN image. This study is an important step for future multi-frequency and high-cadence observations of the EAVN to discuss the more detailed structure of the jet and its time variability. |

|**Abstract**| I present a catalog of distances to 63 molecular clouds located within ~2.5 kpc of the Sun. The cloud distances are derived based on utilizing the Gaia DR3 parallaxes of the young stellar objects (YSOs). By identifying AllWISE YSO candidates (YSOCs) with infrared excesses and combining them with published YSOC catalogs, I compile an all-sky YSOC sample that is devoid of a significant proportion of contaminants. Using Gaia DR3 astrometric measurements, I associate over 3000 YSOCs with 63 local clouds and obtain the average distance to each cloud by fitting the YSOC parallax distribution within the cloud. I find good agreements with typical scatter of <10% between my new cloud distances and previous distance estimates. Unlike cloud distances obtained using stellar extinction, my catalog provides distances to the relatively dense areas of local clouds, which makes them more appropriate references for investigating the physical properties of nearby dense regions. |

|**Abstract**| How black holes consume and eject matter has been the subject of intense studies for more than 60 years. The luminosity of these systems are often compared to the Eddington limit, the border at which the spherical accretion is inhibited by the radiation pressure of photons it produces. The discovery of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) showed that accretion can proceed even when the apparent luminosity exceeds the Eddington limit (Kaaret et al. 2017). High apparent luminosity might be produced by the beaming of the incident radiation by a thick collimated outflow or by a truly super-Eddington accretion flow. However, possibilities to study these outflows in detail are limited, as ULXs are typically found in distant galaxies. Using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE, Weisskopf et al. 2022), we made the first measurement of X-ray polarization in Galactic X-ray binary Cyg X-3. The detection of high, $\approx$25\%, nearly energy-independent linear polarization, orthogonal to the direction of the radio ejections, unambiguously indicates the primary source is obscured and the observer on Earth only sees reflected and scattered light. Modelling shows there is an optically thick envelope with a narrow funnel around the primary X-ray source in the system. We derive an upper limit on the opening angle of the funnel that implies a lower limit on the beamed luminosity exceeding the Eddington value. We show that Cyg X-3 is viewed as a ULX to an extragalactic observer located along the axis of the funnel. Our findings reveal this unique persistent source as an ideal laboratory for the study of the inner workings of ULX central engines. |

|**Abstract**| Measurements of the growth rate of structures at $z < 0.1$ with peculiar velocity surveys have the potential of testing the validity of general relativity on cosmic scales. In this work, we present growth-rate measurements from realistic simulated sets of type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We describe our simulation methodology, the light-curve fitting and peculiar velocity estimation. Using the maximum likelihood method, we derive constraints on $f\sigma_8$ using only ZTF SN Ia peculiar velocities. We carefully tested the method and we quantified biases due to selection effects (photometric detection, spectroscopic follow-up for typing) on several independent realizations. We simulated the equivalent of 6 years of ZTF data, and considering an unbiased spectroscopically typed sample at $z < 0.06$, we obtained unbiased estimates of $f\sigma_8$ with an average uncertainty of 19% precision. We also investigated the information gain in applying bias correction methods. Our results validate our framework which can be used on real ZTF data. |

|**Abstract**| GRB 221009A is the brightest gamma-ray burst ever detected since the discovery of this kind of energetic explosions. However, an accurate measurement of the prompt emission properties of this burst is very challenging due to its exceptional brightness. With joint observations of \textit{Insight}-HXMT and GECAM-C, we made an unprecedentedly accurate measurement of the emission during the first $\sim$1800 s of GRB 221009A, including its precursor, main emission (ME, which dominates the burst in flux), flaring emission and early afterglow, in the hard X-ray to soft gamma-ray band from $\sim$ 10 keV to $\sim$ 6 MeV. Based on the GECAM-C unsaturated data of the ME, we measure a record-breaking isotropic equivalent energy ($E_{\rm iso}$) of $\bf \sim 1.5 \times 10^{55}$ erg, which is about eight times the total rest-mass energy of the Sun. The early afterglow data require a significant jet break between 650 s and 1100 s, most likely at $\sim950$ s from the afterglow starting time $T_{AG}$, which corresponds to a jet opening angle of $\sim {0.7^\circ} \ (\eta_\gamma n)^{1/8}$, where $n$ is the ambient medium density in units of $\rm cm^{-3}$ and $\eta_\gamma$ is the ratio between $\gamma$-ray energy and afterglow kinetic energy. The beaming-corrected total $\gamma$-ray energy $E_{\gamma}$ is $\sim 1.15 \times10^{51} \ (\eta_\gamma n)^{1/4}$ erg, which is typical for long GRBs. These results suggest that this GRB may have a special central engine, which could launch and collimate a very narrowly beamed jet with an ordinary energy budget, leading to exceptionally luminous gamma-ray radiation per unit solid angle. Alternatively, more GRBs might have such a narrow and bright beam, which are missed by an unfavorable viewing angle or have been detected without distance measurement. |

|**Abstract**| In this work we present an application of the Goertzel Filter for the channelization of multi-tonal signals, typically used for the read-out of cryogenic sensors which are multiplexed in the frequency domain (FDM), by means of Microwave Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) Multiplexer ($\mu$MUX). We demonstrate how implementing a bank of many of these filters, can be used to perform a channelization of the multi-tonal input signal to retrieve the data added by the sensors. We show how this approach can be implemented in a resource-efficient manner in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) within the state-of-the-art, which allows great scalability for reading thousands of sensors; as is required by Radio Telescopes in Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) surveys using cryogenic bolometers, particles detection like Neutrino mass estimation using cryogenic calorimeters or Quantum Computing. |

|**Abstract**| Although almost all of the models proposed to resolve several long-standing problems making $\Lambda$CDM imperfect assume that dark matter is pressureless, the probability that dark matter is non-cold is still not excluded by current observations. Therefore, in this article, we treat the equation of state for dark matter as a free parameter, and apply observational data to investigate the non-coldness of dark matter. Impressing by the simplicity of the phenomenological emergent dark energy (PEDE) and its ability to relieve the Hubble tension, we propose the PEDE+$w$DM model based on PEDE and non-cold dark matter. We then place constraints on this model in light of the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillation(BAO) measurements and the Pantheon compilation of Type Ia supernovae. The results indicate a preference for a negative dark matter equation of state at $95\%$ CL for all data sets except CMB alone, which suggests that the non-coldness assumption of dark matter worth to be investigated further in order to understand the nature of dark matter. |
