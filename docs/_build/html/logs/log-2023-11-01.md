|**Abstract**| Measuring the mass-radius relation of individual white dwarfs is an empirically challenging task that has been performed for only a few dozen stars. We measure the white dwarf mass-radius relation using gravitational redshifts and radii of 137 white dwarfs in wide binaries with main sequence companions. We obtain the space velocities to these systems using the main sequence companion, and subtract these Doppler redshifts from the white dwarfs' apparent motions, isolating their gravitational redshifts. We use Gaia data to calculate the surface temperatures and radii of these white dwarfs, thereby deriving an empirical gravitational redshift-radius relation. This work demonstrates the utility of low-resolution Galactic surveys to measure the white dwarf equation of state. Our results are consistent with theoretical models, and represent the largest sample of individual white dwarf gravitational redshift measurements to date. |

|**Abstract**| Modern cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy simulations provide tens of thousands of reasonably realistic synthetic galaxies across cosmic time. However, quantitatively assessing the level of realism of simulated universes in comparison to the real one is difficult. In this paper of the ERGO-ML series (Extracting Reality from Galaxy Observables with Machine Learning), we utilize contrastive learning to directly compare a large sample of simulated and observed galaxies based on their stellar-light images. This eliminates the need to specify summary statistics and allows to exploit the whole information content of the observations. We produce survey-realistic galaxy mock datasets resembling real Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) observations using the cosmological simulations TNG50 and TNG100. Our focus is on galaxies with stellar masses between $10^9$ and $10^{12} M_\odot$ at $z=0.1-0.4$. This allows us to evaluate the realism of the simulated TNG galaxies in comparison to actual HSC observations. We apply the self-supervised contrastive learning method NNCLR to the images from both simulated and observed datasets (g, r, i - bands). This results in a 256-dimensional representation space, encoding all relevant observable galaxy properties. Firstly, this allows us to identify simulated galaxies that closely resemble real ones by seeking similar images in this multi-dimensional space. Even more powerful, we quantify the alignment between the representations of these two image sets, finding that the majority ($\gtrsim 70$ per cent) of the TNG galaxies align well with observed HSC images. However, a subset of simulated galaxies with larger sizes, steeper Sersic profiles, smaller Sersic ellipticities, and larger asymmetries appears unrealistic. We also demonstrate the utility of our derived image representations by inferring properties of real HSC galaxies using simulated TNG galaxies as the ground truth. |

|**Abstract**| The first year of JWST has revealed a surprisingly large number of luminous galaxy candidates beyond $z>10$. While some galaxies are already spectroscopically confirmed, there is mounting evidence that a subsample of the candidates with particularly red inferred UV colors are in fact lower redshift contaminants.These interlopers are often found to be `HST-dark' or `optically-faint' galaxies at $z\sim2-6$, a population key to understanding dust-obscured star formation throughout cosmic time. This paper demonstrates the complementarity of ground-based mm-interferometry and JWST infrared imaging to unveil the true nature of red 1.5-2.0 $\mu$m dropouts that have been selected as ultra-high-redshift galaxy candidates. We present NOEMA Polyfix follow-up observations of four JWST red 1.5-2.0 $\mu$m dropouts selected by Yan et al. 2023 as ultra-high-redshift candidates in the PEARLS field. The new NOEMA observations constrain the rest-frame far-infrared continuum emission and efficiently discriminate between intermediate- and high-redshift solutions. We report $>10\sigma$ NOEMA continuum detections of all our target galaxies at observed frequencies of $\nu$=236 and 252 GHz, with FIR slopes indicating a redshift $z<5$. We model their optical-to-FIR spectral energy distribution (SED) with multiple SED codes, and find that they are not $z>10$ galaxies but instead dust-obscured, massive star-forming galaxies at $z\sim 2-4$. The contribution to the cosmic star-formation rate density of such sources is not negligible at $z\simeq 3.5$ ($\phi\gtrsim(1.9-4.4)\times10^{-3}\ \rm{cMpc}^{-3}$), in line with previous studies of optically-faint/sub-millimeter galaxies. This work showcases a new way to select intermediate- to high-redshift dust-obscured galaxies in JWST fields with minimal wavelength coverage to open a new window on obscured star-formation at intermediate redshifts .[abridged] |

|| P. A. Collaboration, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-11-01*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted to Phys. Rev. Lett*|
|**Abstract**| We show, for the first time, radio measurements of the depth of shower maximum ($X_\text{max}$) of air showers induced by cosmic rays that are compared to measurements of the established fluorescence method at the same location. Using measurements at the Pierre Auger Observatory we show full compatibility between our radio and the previously published fluorescence data set, and between a subset of air showers observed simultaneously with both radio and fluorescence techniques, a measurement setup unique to the Pierre Auger Observatory. Furthermore, we show radio $X_\text{max}$ resolution as a function of energy and demonstrate the ability to make competitive high-resolution $X_\text{max}$ measurements with even a sparse radio array. With this, we show that the radio technique is capable of cosmic-ray mass composition studies, both at Auger and at other experiments. |

|**Abstract**| The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA), part of the Pierre Auger Observatory, is currently the largest array of radio antenna stations deployed for the detection of cosmic rays, spanning an area of $17$ km$^2$ with 153 radio stations. It detects the radio emission of extensive air showers produced by cosmic rays in the $30-80$ MHz band. Here, we report the AERA measurements of the depth of the shower maximum ($X_\text{max}$), a probe for mass composition, at cosmic-ray energies between $10^{17.5}$ to $10^{18.8}$ eV, which show agreement with earlier measurements with the fluorescence technique at the Pierre Auger Observatory. We show advancements in the method for radio $X_\text{max}$ reconstruction by comparison to dedicated sets of CORSIKA/CoREAS air-shower simulations, including steps of reconstruction-bias identification and correction, which is of particular importance for irregular or sparse radio arrays. Using the largest set of radio air-shower measurements to date, we show the radio $X_\text{max}$ resolution as a function of energy, reaching a resolution better than $15$ g cm$^{-2}$ at the highest energies, demonstrating that radio $X_\text{max}$ measurements are competitive with the established high-precision fluorescence technique. In addition, we developed a procedure for performing an extensive data-driven study of systematic uncertainties, including the effects of acceptance bias, reconstruction bias, and the investigation of possible residual biases. These results have been cross-checked with air showers measured independently with both the radio and fluorescence techniques, a setup unique to the Pierre Auger Observatory. |

|**Abstract**| The isotopic ratios are good tools for probing the stellar nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution. We performed high-sensitivity mapping observations of the J=7-6 rotational transitions of OCS, OC34S, O13CS, and OC33S toward the Galactic Center giant molecular cloud, Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2) with IRAM 30m telescope. Positions with optically thin and uncontaminated lines are chosen to determine the sulfur isotope ratios. A 32S/34S ratio of 17.1\pm0.9 was derived with OCS and OC34S lines, while 34S/33S ratio of 6.8\pm1.9 was derived directly from integrated intensity ratio of OC34S and OC33S. With independent and accurate measurements of 32S/34S ratio, our results confirm the termination of the decreasing trend of 32S/34S ratios toward the Galactic Center, suggesting a drop in the production of massive stars at the Galactic centre. |
