|**Abstract**|            We report near-infrared spectral model fits to seven distant L- and T-type dwarfs observed with the JWST Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) as part of the Red Unknowns: Bright Infrared Extragalactic Survey (RUBIES). Comparison of 0.9-2.5 $\mu$m near-infrared spectra of these sources to spectral standards indicates spectral types spanning L1 to T8, and spectrophotometric distances spanning 800-3,000 pc. Fits to three grids of spectral models yield atmosphere parameters and spectrophotometric distances largely consistent with our classifications, although fits to L dwarf spectra indicate missing components to the models. Three of our sources have vertical displacements from the Galactic plane exceeding 1 kpc, and have high probabilities of membership in the Galactic thick disk population. Of these, the L dwarf RUBIES-BD-3 (RUBIES-EGS-3081) is well-matched to subdwarf standards, while the early T dwarf RUBIES-BD-5 (RUBIES-UDS-170428) is best fit by metal-poor atmosphere models; both many be a thick disk or halo brown dwarfs. We critically examine the 1-5 $\mu$m spectra of the current sample of 1-2 kpc mid- and late-T dwarfs, finding that temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and vertical mixing efficiency can all contribute to observed variations in near-infrared spectral structure and the strength of the 4.2 $\mu$m CO band. This work aims to guide ongoing JWST, Euclid, and other space-based spectral surveys that are expected to uncover thousands of low-temperature stars and brown dwarfs throughout the Milky Way.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present an analysis of the QUARKS survey sample, focusing on protoclusters where Hot Molecular Cores (HMCs, traced by CH3CN(12--11)) and UC HII regions (traced by H30\alpha/H40\alpha) coexist. Using the high-resolution, high-sensitivity 1.3 mm data from the QUARKS survey, we identify 125 Hot Molecular Fragments (HMFs), which represent the substructures of HMCs at higher resolution. From line integrated intensity maps of CH3CN(12--11) and H30\alpha, we resolve the spatial distribution of HMFs and UC HII regions. By combining with observations of CO outflows and 1.3 mm continuum, we classify HMFs into four types: HMFs associated with jet-like outflow, with wide-angle outflow, with non-detectable outflow, and shell-like HMFs near UC HII regions. This diversity possibly indicates that the hot core could be polymorphic and long-standing phenomenon in the evolution of massive protostars. The separation between HMFs and H30\alpha/H40\alpha emission suggests that sequential high-mass star formation within young protoclusters is not likely related to feedback mechanisms.         |

|| M. Rybak, et al. -- incl., <mark>F. Walter</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-11-04*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted to A&A. First version 14th August 2025; revised 4th November 2025*|
|**Abstract**|            Characterising the relationship between dense gas and star formation is critical for understanding the assembly of galaxies throughout cosmic history. However, due to the faintness of standard dense-gas tracers - HCN, HCO+, and HNC - dense gas in high-redshift galaxies remains largely unexplored. We present ALMA and NOEMA observations targeting HCN/HCO+/HNC (3-2) and (4-3) emission lines in eleven (mostly) gravitationally lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at redshift z = 1.6--3.2. We detect at least one line in 10 out of 11 galaxies. Altogether, we detect 34 dense-gas transitions, more than quadrupling the number of extant high-redshift detections. Additionally, in two targets, we detect lower-abundance CO isotopologues 13^CO and C^18O, as well as CN emission. We derive excitation coefficients for HCN, HCO+ and HNC in DSFGs, finding them to be systematically higher than those in nearby luminous infrared galaxies. Assuming a canonical dense-mass conversion factor (alpha_HCN = 10), we find that DSFGs have shorter dense- gas depletion times (median 23 Myr) than nearby galaxies (~60 Myr), with a star-forming efficiency per free-fall time of 1-2%, a factor of a few higher than in local galaxies. We find a wide range of dense-gas fractions, with HCN/CO ratios ranging between 0.01 and 0.15. Finally, we put the first constraints on the redshift evolution of the cosmic dense-gas density, which increases by a factor of 7+/-4 between z = 0 and z = 2.5, consistent with the evolution of the cosmic molecular-gas density.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present near-infrared scattered-light observations of the disks around two stars of the Corona Australis star-forming region, V721 CrA, and BN CrA, obtained with VLT/SPHERE, in the H band, as part of the DESTINYS large programme. Our objective is to analyse the morphology of these disks, and highlight their main properties. We adopt an analytical axisymmetric disk model to fit the observations and perform a regression on key disk parameters, namely the dust mass, the height profile, and the inclination. We use RADMC-3D code to produce synthetic observations of the analytical models, with full polarised scattering treatment. Both stars show resolved and extended disks with substructures in the near-IR. The disk of V721 CrA is vertically thicker, radially smaller (120 au), and brighter than BN CrA (190 au). It also shows spiral arms in the inner regions. The disk of BN CrA shows a dark circular lane, which could be either an intrinsic dust gap or a self-cast shadow, and a brightness enhancement along the disk minor axis. Both disks are compatible with the evolutionary stage of their parent subgroup within the CrA region: V721 CrA belongs to the "on-cloud" part of CrA, which is dustier, denser and younger, whereas BN CrA is found on the outskirts of the older "off-cloud" group.         |

|| <mark>J. Li</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-11-04*|
|*Comments*| *9 pages, submitted to ApJL*|
|**Abstract**|            The abundance of satellite galaxies provides a direct test of $\Lambda$CDM on small scales. While satellites of Milky Way-mass galaxies are well studied, those of dwarf galaxies remain largely unexplored. We present a systematic search for satellites around the isolated dwarf galaxy DDO 161 ($M_\star \approx 10^{8.4}\, M_\odot$) at a distance of 6 Mpc. We identify eight satellite candidates within the projected virial radius and confirm four satellites through surface brightness fluctuation distance measurements from deep Magellan imaging data. With four confirmed satellites above $M_{\star}^{\rm sat} > 10^{5.4}\, M_\odot$, DDO 161 is the most satellite-rich dwarf galaxy known to date. We compare this system with predictions from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, combined with currently established galaxy-halo connection models calibrated on Milky Way satellites, and find that DDO 161 has a satellite abundance far exceeding all current expectations. The rich satellite system of DDO 161 offers new insight into how low-mass galaxies occupy dark matter halos in low-density environments and may provide new constraints on the nature of dark matter.         |

|**Abstract**|            Accretion of metal-poor gas is expected to be an important channel of gas replenishment in galaxy evolution studies. However, observational evidence of this process is still relatively scarce. The unusual polar disk galaxy VGS 12 was found in the Void Galaxy Survey. It appears to be isolated and resides in the cosmological wall between two large voids. The suggested formation scenario for this peculiar system is accretion of metal-poor gas from the void interior. We present the data on the gas-phase chemical abundance of VGS 12 obtained with the Russian 6m telescope BTA. We complement our analysis with HI data obtained with VLA and the data on the kinematics of the ionized gas. VGS 12 appears to be a strong outlier from the "metallicity - luminosity" relation, with gas oxygen abundance ~0.7dex lower than expected for its luminosity. The nitrogen abundance, on the other hand, is higher than what is typically observed in galaxies with similar metallicity, but is consistent with the metallicity expected given its luminosity. Such behavior is what is expected in the case of metal-poor gas accretion. The HI reveals clear morphological and kinematical asymmetry between the northern and southern parts of the disk, which are likely related to its unsettled state due to the recent accretion event. The kinematics of the ionized gas seen in Halpha reveal prolate rotation and follow closely the rotation of the HI disk, so we suggest this is accreted HI gas ionized by the stars in the central region of the galaxy. Together, our findings provide strong, multiwavelength evidence of ongoing cold gas accretion in a galaxy caught in the act of growing from the cosmic web. This is one of the very few individual galaxies where a convincing case can be made for such a process, and demonstrates the potential for cold accretion to contribute to galaxy growth even in the low-redshift universe.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2025-11-04*|

|**Abstract**|            Planet formation may begin much earlier than previously expected, when the protoplanetary disk is still massive and gravitationally unstable. It has been proposed that solid grains can concentrate in the spiral arms of self-gravitating disks, leading to the formation of planetary embryos or cores that can greatly accelerate the process of planet formation. We perform hydrodynamic simulations of self-gravitating gas and even smaller dust grains than previously investigated in 3-dimensional shearing box simulations to explore the conditions necessary to form these planetary seeds. Focusing on small grains of dimensionless stopping time $\mathrm{St}=0.01$ and shorter, we find that disk metallicities $Z \gtrsim 0.02$ can overcome the disruptive effects of dust diffusion among these small dust grains. In the outer reaches of a gravitationally unstable disk, these models correspond to grains of approximately 1$\,mm$ and lead to planetary embryos between 0.1 and 1 Earth mass. The formation of these planetary embryos could therefore reduce the time needed for planet assembly, particularly in the outer regions of the disk where coagulation timescales are longer and solid growth is limited.         |
