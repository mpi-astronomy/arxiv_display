|**Abstract**|            Radial drift of icy pebbles can have a large impact on the chemistry of the inner regions of protoplanetary disks. Compact dust disks ($\lesssim$50 au) are suggested to have a higher (cold) H$_2$O flux than more extended disks, likely due to efficient radial drift bringing H$_2$O-rich material to the inner disk, where it can be observed with JWST. We present JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the disk CX Tau taken as a part of the Mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS) GTO program, a prime example of a drift-dominated disk. This compact disk seems peculiar: the source possesses a bright CO$_2$ feature instead of the bright H$_2$O expected based on its efficient radial drift. We aim to provide an explanation for this finding. We detect molecular emission from H$_2$O, $^{12}$CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, and OH in this disk, and even demonstrate a potential detection of CO$^{18}$O. Analysis of the $^{12}$CO$_2$ and $^{13}$CO$_2$ emission shows the former to be tracing a temperature of $\sim$450 K, whereas the $^{13}$CO$_2$ traces a significantly colder temperature ($\sim$200 K). H$_2$O is also securely detected both at shorter and longer wavelengths, tracing a similar temperature of $\sim$500-600 K as the CO$_2$ emission. We also find evidence for a colder, $\sim$200 K H$_2$O component at longer wavelengths, which is in line with this disk having strong radial drift. The cold $^{13}$CO$_2$ and H$_2$O emission indicate that radial drift of ices likely plays an important role in setting the chemistry of the inner disk of CX Tau. Potentially, the H$_2$O-rich gas has already advected onto the central star, which is now followed by an enhancement of comparatively CO$_2$-rich gas reaching the inner disk, explaining the enhancement of CO$_2$ emission in CX Tau. The comparatively weaker H$_2$O emission can be explained by the source's low accretion luminosity. (abridged)         |

|**Abstract**|            This paper presents a deep MIRI/JWST medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS) covering the rest-frame optical spectrum of the GN-z11 galaxy. The [OIII]5008 and H$\alpha$ emission lines are detected and spectroscopically resolved. The line profiles are well-modeled by a narrow Gaussian component with intrinsic FWHMs of 189$\pm$25 and 231$\pm$52 kms$^{-1}$, respectively. We do not find any evidence of a dominant broad H$\alpha$ emission line component tracing a Broad Line Region in a type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, a broad ($\sim$430-470 kms$^{-1}$) and weak ($<$ 20-30%) H$\alpha$ line component, tracing a minor AGN contribution in the optical, cannot be ruled out completely with the sensitivity of the present data. The physical and excitation properties of the ionized gas are consistent with a low-metallicity starburst forming stars at a rate of SFR(H$\alpha$)$=$24 $\pm$3$M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. The electron temperature of the ionized gas is $T_{\mathrm{e}}$(O$^{++}$)$=$14000$\pm$2100K, while the direct-$T_{\mathrm{e}}$ gas-phase metallicity is 12+$\log$(O/H)$=$7.91$\pm$0.07 (Z=0.17$\pm$0.03Z$_{\odot}$). The optical line ratios locate GN-z11 in the starburst or AGN region but more consistent with those of local low-metallicity starbursts and high-$z$ luminous galaxies detected at redshifts similar to GN-z11. We conclude that the MRS optical spectrum of GN-z11 is consistent with that of a massive, compact, and low-metallicity starburst galaxy. Due to its high SFR and stellar mass surface densities, close to that of the densest stellar clusters, we speculate that GN-z11 could be undergoing a feedback-free, highly efficient starburst phase. Additional JWST data are needed to validate this scenario, and other recently proposed alternatives, to explain the existence of bright compact galaxies in the early Universe.         |

|**Abstract**|            Spectroscopic observations of binary stars in globular clusters are essential to shed light on the poorly constrained period, eccentricity, and mass ratio distributions and to develop an understanding of the formation of peculiar stellar objects. 47 Tuc (NGC 104) is one of the most massive Galactic globular clusters, with a large population of blue stragglers and with many predicted but as-yet elusive stellar-mass black holes. This makes it an exciting candidate for binary searches. We present a multi-epoch spectroscopic survey of 47 Tuc with the VLT/MUSE integral field spectrograph to determine radial velocity variations for 21,699 stars. We find a total binary fraction in the cluster of $(2.4\pm1.0)\%$, consistent with previous photometric estimates, and an increased binary fraction among blue straggler stars, approximately three times higher than the cluster average. We find very few binaries with periods below three days, and none with massive dark companions. A comparison with predictions from state-of-the-art models shows that the absence of such short-period binaries and of binaries with massive companions is surprising, highlighting the need to improve our understanding of stellar and dynamical evolution in binary systems.         |

|| L.-t. Zhu, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            We develop a simple method to search for changing-look (CL) active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates, and conduct a test run. In this method, optical variations of AGNs are monitored and CL-AGNs may appear to have a pattern of being bluer when in brightening flare-like events. Applying this method, previously-classified type 2 AGNs that show the bluer-when-brighter (BWB) pattern are selected. Among more than ten thousands type 2 AGNs classified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we find 73 candidates with possibly the strongest BWB pattern. We note that 13 of them have previously been reported as CL-AGNs. We have observed nine candidates, and found that five among them showed the CL transition from type 2 to type 1. In addition, we also test extending the selection to previously-classified type 1 AGNs in the SDSS by finding sources with a possible redder-when-brighter pattern, but none of the three sources observed by us is found to show the transition from type 1 to type 2. We discuss the variation properties in both the success and failure cases, and plan to observe more candidates selected with the method. From the observational results, a detailed comparison between the CL-AGNs and none CL-AGNs will help quantitatively refine the selection criteria and in turn allow us to configure the general properties of CLAGNs.         |

|| J. Lin, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-12-18*|

|**Abstract**|            As the time-domain survey telescope of the highest survey power in the northern hemisphere currently, Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) is scheduled to hourly/daily/semi-weekly scan northern sky up to ~23 mag in four optical (ugri) bands. Unlike the observation cadences in the forthcoming regular survey missions, WFST performed "staring" observations toward Galactic plane in a cadence of $\approx$1 minute for a total on-source time of about 13 hours, during the commissioning and pilot observation phases. Such an observation cadence is well applied in producing densely sampling light curves and hunting for stars exhibiting fast stellar variabilities. Here we introduce the primary methodologies in detecting variability, periodicity, and stellar flares among a half million sources from the minute-cadence observations, and present the WFST g-/r-band light curves generated from periodic variable stars and flaring stars. Benefit from high photometric precisions and deep detection limits of WFST, the observations have captured several rare variable stars, such as a variable hot white dwarf (WD) and an ellipsoidal WD binary candidate. By surveying the almost unexplored parameter spaces for variables, WFST will lead to new opportunities in discovering unique variable stars in the northern sky.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2024-12-18*|
|*Comments*| *11 pages, 6 figures, in review (submitted on Dec 9th, 2024)*|
|**Abstract**|            Linkage between core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and their progenitors is not fully understood and ongoing effort of searching and identifying the progenitors is needed. $\mathrm{SN\,2024abfl}$ is a recent Type II supernova exploded in the nearby star-bursting galaxy $\mathrm{NGC\,2146}$, which is also the host galaxy of $\mathrm{SN\,2018zd}$. From archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, we have found a red source ($\mathrm{m_{F814W} \sim 25}$) near the location (angular distance $\leq 0.2"$) of $\mathrm{SN\,2024abfl}$ before its explosion. With F814W and F606W photometry, we found that the properties of this source matched a typical red supergiant (RSG) moderately reddened by interstellar dust at the distance of the host galaxy. We conclude that the $\mathrm{SN\,2024abfl}$ had an RSG progenitor with initial mass of $\mathrm{10M_{\odot}}$--$\mathrm{16\,M_{\odot}}$.         |
