|**Abstract**|            The combination of detection techniques enhances our ability to identify companions orbiting nearby stars. We employed high-contrast imaging to constrain mass and separation of possible companions responsible for the significant proper motion anomalies of the nearby stars HIP 11696, HIP 47110 and HIP 36277. These targets were observed using the LBT's high-contrast camera, SHARK-NIR, in H-band using a Gaussian coronagraph, and with the LMIRCam instrument in the L'-band and using a vAPP coronagraph. Both observations were conducted simultaneously. Additionally, constraints at short separations from the host star are derived analyzing the renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) values from the Gaia catalogue. We find that the companion responsible for the anomaly signal of HIP 11696 is likely positioned at a distance from 2.5 to 28 astronomical units from its host. Its mass is estimated to be between 4 and 16 Jupiter masses, with the greater mass possible only at the upper end of the separation range. Similar limits were obtained for HIP 47110 where the companion should reside between 3 and 30 au with a mass between 3 and 10 MJup. For HIP 36277, we identified a faint stellar companion at large separation, though it might be substellar depending on the assumed age for the star. Considering the older age, this object accounts for the absolute value of the PMa vector but not for its direction. Additionally, we found a substellar candidate companion at a closer separation that could explain the PMa signal, considering a younger age for the system.         |

|**Abstract**|            We explore the radio emission of spectroscopically confirmed, X-ray weak, Broad Line AGN (BLAGN, or type 1) selected with JWST in the GOODS-N field, one of the fields with the best combination of deep radio observations and statistics of JWST-selected BLAGN. We use deep radio data at different frequencies (144\,MHz, 1.5\,GHz, 3\,GHz, 5.5\,GHz, 10\,GHz), and we find that none of the 22 sources investigated is detected at any of the aforementioned frequencies. Similarly, the radio stacking analysis does not reveal any detection down to an rms of $\sim 0.2\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, corresponding to a $3\sigma$ upper limit at rest frame 5 GHz of $L_{5GHz}=2\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at the mean redshift of the sample $z\sim 5.2$. We compared this and individual sources upper limits with expected radio luminosities estimated assuming different AGN scaling relations. For most of the sources the radio luminosity upper limits are still compatible with expectations for radio-quiet (RQ) AGN; nevertheless, the more stringent stacking upper limits and the fact that no detection is found would suggest that JWST-selected BLAGN are weaker than standard AGN even at radio frequencies. We discuss some scenarios that could explain the possible radio weakness, such as free-free absorption from a dense medium, or the lack of either magnetic field or a corona, possibly as a consequence of super-Eddington accretion. These scenarios would also explain the observed X-ray weakness. We also conclude that $\sim$1 dex more sensitive radio observations are needed to better constrain the level of radio emission (or lack thereof) for the bulk of these sources. The Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) will likely play a crucial role in assessing the properties of this AGN population.         |

|**Abstract**|            The 2175Å bump is a prominent absorption feature at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths in dust extinction and attenuation curves. Understanding the relative strength of this feature is important for accurate dust corrections at both low- and high-redshift. This feature is postulated to arise from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dust grains; however, the carrier has not been definitively established. We present results on the correlation between the 2175Å feature and PAH abundances in a spatially-resolved manner for 15 local galaxies in the PHANGS-JWST survey that have NUV and mid-IR imaging data from Swift/UVOT and JWST/MIRI, respectively. We find a moderate positive correlation between the 2175Å feature strength and PAH abundance, albeit with large intrinsic scatter. However, most of this trend can be attributed to a stronger negative correlation of both quantities with SFR surface density and specific-SFR (proxies of ionising radiation). The latter trends are consistent with previous findings that both the 2175Å carrier and PAHs are small grains that are easily destroyed by UV photons, although the proxy for PAH abundance could also be influenced by dust heating. When controlling for SFR surface density, we find weaker correlations between the 2175Å feature and PAH abundances, disfavouring a direct link. However, analyses based on spectroscopic measurements of the 2175Å feature and PAH features are required to verify our findings. No significant trends with gas-phase metallicity are found for the 2175Å feature and PAHs, however the metallicity range of our sample is limited. We provide prescriptions for the strength of the 2175Å feature and PAHs in local massive (metal-rich) galaxies with SFR surface density and specific-SFR, however the former should be used with caution since bump strengths measured from Swift/UVOT are expected to be underestimated.         |

|| Q. Xie, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-12-06*|

|**Abstract**|            Swirl-shaped flow structures have been observed throughout the solar atmosphere, in both emission and absorption, at different altitudes and locations, and are believed to be associated with magnetic structures. However, the distribution patterns of such swirls, especially their spatial positions, remain unclear. Using the Automated Swirl Detection Algorithm (ASDA), we identified swirls from the high-resolution photospheric observations, centered on Fe I 630.25 nm, of a quiet region near the Sun's central meridian by the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. Through a detailed study of the locations of the detected small-scale swirls with an average radius of $\sim$300 km, we found that most of them are located in lanes between mesogranules (which have an average diameter of $\sim$5.4 Mm) instead of the commonly believed intergranular lanes. The squared rotation, expansion/contraction, vector speeds, and proxy kinetic energy are all found to follow Gaussian distributions. Their rotation speed, expansion/contraction speed, and circulation are positively correlated with their radius. These results suggest that photospheric swirls at different scales and locations across the observational 56.5" $\times$ 57.5" field-of-view (FOV) could share the same triggering mechanism at preferred spatial and energy scales. A comparison with previous work suggests that the number of photospheric swirls is positively correlated with the number of local magnetic concentrations, stressing the close relation between swirls and local magnetic concentrations:the number of swirls should positively correlate with the number and strength of local magnetic concentrations.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2024-12-06*|

|**Abstract**|            In this work, optical observations of the nova V5584 Sgr are presented. These observations cover different phases including pre-maximum, early decline, and nebular. The spectra are dominated by hydrogen Balmer, Fe II, and O I lines with P-Cygni profiles in the early phase, which are subsequently observed in complete emission. The presence of numerous Fe II lines and low ejecta velocity aligns with the Fe II type nova classification. From optical and NIR colors it is clear that this nova manifests dust formation in the ejecta. The dust temperature and mass were estimated from a spectral energy distribution (SED) fit to the JHK band magnitudes and the WISE data. Light curve analysis shows t$_2$ and t$_3$ values of $\sim$ 26 and $\sim$ 48 days, classifying the nova as moderately fast. The physical and chemical properties during early decline and later phases were evaluated using the photoionization code CLOUDY. The best-fit model parameters from two epochs of multiwavelength spectra are compatible with a hot white dwarf source with a roughly constant luminosity of $\sim$ (2.08 $\pm$ 0.10) $\times$ 10$^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We find an ejected mass of $\sim$ (1.59 $\pm$ 0.04) $\times$ 10$^{-4}$M$_{\odot}$. Abundance analysis indicates that the ejecta is significantly enriched relative to solar values, with O/H = 30.2, C/H = 10.8, He/H = 1.8, Mg/H = 1.68, Na/H = 1.55, and N/H = 45.5 in the early decline phase, and O/H = 4.5, Ne/H = 1.5, and N/H = 24.5 in the nebular phase.         |
