|**Abstract**|            The Doppler beaming effect, induced by the reflex motion of stars, introduces flux modulations and serves as an efficient method to photometrically determine mass functions for a large number of close binary systems, particularly those involving compact objects. In order to convert observed beaming-flux variations into a radial-velocity curve, precise determination of the beaming factor is essential. Previously, this factor was calculated as a constant, assuming a power-law profile for stellar spectra. In this study, we present a novel approach to directly compute this factor. Our new method not only simplifies the computation, especially for blue bands and cool stars, but also enables us to evaluate whether the relationship between beaming flux and radial velocity can be accurately described as linear. We develop a python code and compute a comprehensive beaming-factor table for commonly used filter systems covering main-sequence, subgiant, and giant stars, as well as hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars. Both the code and our table are archived and publicly available at this http URL.         |

|| Z. Lin, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-08-05*|
|*Comments*| *19 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables; accepted for publication in ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            We present a comprehensive study based on multi-wavelength observations from the NuSTAR, NICER, Swift, Fermi, NEOWISE, and ATCA telescopes during the 2022 outburst of the black hole X-ray binary IGR J17091-3624. Our investigation concentrates on the heartbeat-like variability in the X-ray emission, with the aim of using it as a tool to unravel the origin of the non-thermal emission during the heartbeat state. Through X-ray timing and spectral analysis, we observe that the heartbeat-like variability correlates with changes in the disk temperature, supporting the disk radiation pressure instability scenario. Moreover, in addition to a Comptonization component, our time-averaged and phase-resolved spectroscopy reveal the presence of a power-law component that varies independently from the disk component. Combined with the radio to X-ray spectral energy distribution fitting, our results suggest that the power-law component could originate from synchrotron self-Compton radiation in the jet, which requires a strong magnetic field of about $B = (0.3$-$3.5)\times10^6$ G. Additionally, assuming that IGR J17091-3624 and GRS 1915+105 share the same radio-X-ray correlation coefficient during both the hard and the heartbeat states, we obtain a distance of $13.7\pm2.3$ kpc for IGR J17091-3624.         |

|| D. Li, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-08-05*|
|*Comments*| *7 pages, accepted for publication in A&A*|
|**Abstract**|            We investigated the intermittent energy-releasing processes by analyzing the long-period pulsations during a C2.8 flare on 2023 June 03. The C2.8 flare shows three successive and repetitive pulsations in soft X-ray (SXR) and high-temperature extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emissions, which may imply three episodes of energy releases during the solar flare. The QPP period is estimated to be as long as about 7.5 minutes. EUV imaging observations suggest that these three pulsations come from the same flare area dominated by the hot loop system. Conversely, the flare radiation in wavelengths of radio/microwave, low-temperature EUV, ultraviolet (UV), and Ha only reveals the first pulsation, which may be associated with nonthermal electrons accelerated by magnetic reconnection. The other two pulsations in wavelengths of SXR and high-temperature EUV might be caused by the loop-loop interaction. Our observations indicate that the three episodes of energy releases during the C2.8 flare are triggered by different mechanisms, namely the accelerated electron via magnetic reconnection, and the loop-loop interaction in a complicated magnetic configuration.         |

|| S. Rojas-Ruiz, et al. -- incl., <mark>E. Ba√±ados</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-08-05*|
|*Comments*| *13 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables*|
|**Abstract**|            We present new results on the rest-frame UV luminosity function (UVLF) and stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratio of bright (M$_{\rm UV}\lesssim-20$ mag) spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at $z=7-9$ derived from the BoRG-$JWST$ survey, a unique data set of NIRSpec prism follow up of $HST$-selected sources from random-pointing imaging. By selecting galaxies from over 200 independent sight lines, the survey minimizes cosmic variance ensuring a statistically robust sample of the bright-galaxy population during the epoch of reionization. The data is used to constrain, for the first time, the bright end of the UVLF at $z=7-9$ from spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies over eight independent fields. We find that the bright end of the UVLF is higher than found using imaging over $JWST$ legacy fields, suggesting the latter may be significantly affected by cosmic variance, and thus reducing the tension with recent findings from $JWST$ at $z>10$ and comparable to models invoking little dust attenuation and bursty star formation. Additionally, we use the galaxies' $JWST$ spectra to infer their stellar masses and M/L ratios relative to other $HST$ and $JWST$ studies. We show that the stellar mass scales almost linearly with UV luminosity (M$_* \propto L_{\rm UV}^{0.85\pm0.12}$), albeit with large ($\sim0.5$ dex) intrinsic scatter, consistent with stochastic bursts of star formation in early galaxy formation.         |
