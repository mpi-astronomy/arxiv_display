|**Abstract**|            Improved observational technologies have enabled the resolution of substructures and the measurement of chemical abundances in protoplanetary discs. Understanding the chemical composition of the inner disc allows us to infer the building blocks available for planet formation. Recently, the depletion of water in the inner disc has been suggested to be linked to the presence of substructures like gaps and rings further out in the disc. We investigate this hypothesis further by running 1D semi-analytical models of a protoplanetary disc with a gap to understand the combined effects of disc viscosity, gap depth, gap location and gap formation time on the composition of the inner disc. Our results show that for a specific value of disc viscosity, the simulation outcome can be classified into three regimes: shallow gap, 'traffic jam', and deep gap. While deep gaps may already be distinguishable with moderate resolution, shallow gaps remains a challenge to resolve with current capabilities. On the other hand, discs with traffic jams have a higher chance of being resolved when observed with high resolution but may appear as an intensity enhancement or even featureless when observed with moderate to low angular resolution. In this regard, information on the inner disc composition is useful because it can help to infer the existence of traffic jams or distinguish them from deep gaps: Discs with deep gaps are expected to have a low water content and thus high C/O ratio in the inner disc due to the effective blocking of pebbles, discs with shallow gaps would show the opposite trend, and discs with traffic jam would have a constant -- albeit low -- inward flux of water-rich pebbles resulting in a moderate water content and sub-stellar C/O ratios. Finally, we find that the effectiveness of gaps as pebble barriers diminishes quickly when they form late, as most of the pebbles already drifted inwards.         |

|| <mark>J. Lian</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-06-11*|
|*Comments*| *30 pages, 4figures*|
|**Abstract**|            The size of a galaxy is one of the fundamental parameters that reflects its growth and assembly history. Traditionally, the size of the Milky Way has been characterized by the scale length of the disk, based on the assumption of an exponential density profile. Earlier scale length measurements suggest the Milky Way is an overly compact galaxy, compared to similar galaxies of its mass. These size measurements, however, ignore the presence of the bulge, and the assumption of a single-exponential disk profile faces growing challenges from the recent observations. The half-light radius is an alternative size measurement that is independent of the galaxy density profile and has been widely used to quantify the size of external galaxies. Here we report the half-light radius of the Milky Way, derived from a new measurement of the age-resolved Galactic surface brightness profile in an unprecedentedly wide radial range from ${\rm R=0}$ to 17~kpc. We find a broken surface brightness profile with a nearly flat distribution between 3.5 and 7.5 kpc, which results in a half-light radius of 5.75$\pm$0.38 kpc, significantly larger than the scale-length inferred from the canonical single-exponential disk profile but in good consistency with local disk galaxies of similar mass. Because our density profile can be decomposed by stellar age and extrapolated backwards in time, we can also confirm that the size history of the Milky Way is broadly consistent with high-redshift galaxies but with systematically smaller size at each look back time. Our results suggest that the Milky Way is a typical disk galaxy regarding its size and has likely experienced inefficient secular size growth.         |

|| <mark>J. Li</mark>, A. Boogert, A. G. G. M. Tielens |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-06-11*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in ApJS. 26 pages, 23 figures. Comments are more than welcome!*|
|**Abstract**|            Ro-vibrational absorption lines of H$_2$O in the 5-8 $\mu$m wavelength range selectively probe gas against the mid-infrared continuum emitting background of the inner regions of YSOs and AGN and deliver important information about these warm, dust-obscured environments. JWST/MIRI detects these lines in many lines of sight at a moderate spectral resolving power of $R\sim3500$ (FWHM of 85 km/s). Based on our analysis of high-resolution SOFIA/EXES observations, we find that the interpretation of JWST/MIRI absorption spectra can be severely hampered by the blending of individual transitions and the lost information on the intrinsic line width or the partial coverage of the background continuum source. In this paper, we point out problems such as degeneracy that arise in deriving physical properties from an insufficiently resolved spectrum. This can lead to differences in the column density by two orders of magnitude. We emphasize the importance of weighting optically thin and weak lines in spectral analyses and provide recipes for breaking down the coupled parameters. We also provide an online tool to generate the H$_2$O absorption line spectra that can be compared to observations.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present measurements of the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum $X_\mathrm{max}$, inferred for the first time on an event-by-event level using the Surface Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Using deep learning, we were able to extend measurements of the $X_\mathrm{max}$ distributions up to energies of 100 EeV ($10^{20}$ eV), not yet revealed by current measurements, providing new insights into the mass composition of cosmic rays at extreme energies. Gaining a 10-fold increase in statistics compared to the Fluorescence Detector data, we find evidence that the rate of change of the average $X_\mathrm{max}$ with the logarithm of energy features three breaks at $6.5\pm0.6~(\mathrm{stat})\pm1~(\mathrm{sys})$ EeV, $11\pm 2~(\mathrm{stat})\pm1~(\mathrm{sys})$ EeV, and $31\pm5~(\mathrm{stat})\pm3~(\mathrm{sys})$ EeV, in the vicinity to the three prominent features (ankle, instep, suppression) of the cosmic-ray flux. The energy evolution of the mean and standard deviation of the measured $X_\mathrm{max}$ distributions indicates that the mass composition becomes increasingly heavier and purer, thus being incompatible with a large fraction of light nuclei between 50 EeV and 100 EeV.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report an investigation of the mass composition of cosmic rays with energies from 3 to 100 EeV (1 EeV=$10^{18}$ eV) using the distributions of the depth of shower maximum $X_\mathrm{max}$. The analysis relies on ${\sim}50,000$ events recorded by the Surface Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory and a deep-learning-based reconstruction algorithm. Above energies of 5 EeV, the data set offers a 10-fold increase in statistics with respect to fluorescence measurements at the Observatory. After cross-calibration using the Fluorescence Detector, this enables the first measurement of the evolution of the mean and the standard deviation of the $X_\mathrm{max}$ distributions up to 100 EeV. Our findings are threefold: (1.) The evolution of the mean logarithmic mass towards a heavier composition with increasing energy can be confirmed and is extended to 100 EeV. (2.) The evolution of the fluctuations of $X_\mathrm{max}$ towards a heavier and purer composition with increasing energy can be confirmed with high statistics. We report a rather heavy composition and small fluctuations in $X_\mathrm{max}$ at the highest energies. (3.) We find indications for a characteristic structure beyond a constant change in the mean logarithmic mass, featuring three breaks that are observed in proximity to the ankle, instep, and suppression features in the energy spectrum.         |
