|**Abstract**|            We investigate the evolution of the bar fraction and length using an extended JWST NIRCam imaging dataset of galaxies in the $1 \leq z \leq 4$ redshift range. We assess the wavelength dependence of the bar fraction in disc galaxies and bar length evolution by selecting a nearly mass-complete CEERS disc sample and performing independent visual classifications on the short (F200W) and long (F356W+F444W) wavelength channels. A similar bar fraction is observed for both samples, and combined we find a declining trend in the bar fraction: $0.16^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ at $1 \leq z < 2$; $0.08^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ at $2 \leq z < 3$; $0.07^{+0.03}_{-0.01}$ at $3 \leq z \leq 4$. This corroborates our previous work and other recent studies, suggesting that dynamically cold and rotationally supported massive discs are present at Cosmic Noon. No evolution in the F356W+F444W bar length is measured from $z = 4$ to $z = 1$, which has a mean of 3.6\,kpc, but a slight increase of about 1\,kpc towards $z = 1$ is measured in the F200W sample, which has a mean of 2.9\,kpc. The bar sample is shorter in the short-wavelength channel due to the better physical spatial resolution; however, we also suggest that dust obscuration plays a role. We find that the correlation between bar length and galaxy mass for massive galaxies observed at $z < 1$ is not seen at $z > 1$. By adding samples of barred galaxies at $z<1$, we show that there is a modest increase in the bar length ($\approx 2$\,kpc) towards $z=0$, but bars longer than $\approx8$\,kpc are only found at $z<1$. We show that bars and discs grow in tandem, for the bar length normalised by disc size does not evolve from $z = 4$ to $z = 0$. Not only is a significant population of bars forming beyond $z = 1$, but our results also show that some of these bars are as long and strong as the average bar at $z\approx0$.         |

|**Abstract**|            Analyses of IFU data are typically performed on a per-spaxel basis, with each spectrum modelled independently. For low signal-to-noise (S/N) features such as weak emission lines, estimating properties is difficult and imprecise. Arbitrary binning schemes boost S/N at the cost of resolution, and risk introducing biases. We present a general forward-modelling approach that assumes spectra close on the sky are more similar than distant ones, and so can be modelled jointly. These "spectrospatial" models exploit spatial correlation to provide robust inferences, while simultaneously providing continuous predictions of line properties like strength and kinematics across the sky. Instrumental and calibration systematics are straightforward to include and infer. The model provides a natural trade-off between spatial resolution and S/N in a data-driven way. We apply this to Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) Local Volume Mapper (LVM) data of the Rosette Nebula, producing continuous maps of fluxes and kinematics for Balmer, nebular, and auroral lines, as well as weak C II and N II recombination lines, demonstrating the approach across three orders of magnitude in S/N, including in the very low-S/N regime. The method recovers identical morphologies across different lines tracing similar ionisation volumes, at varying resolutions set by the S/N. We additionally provide a general framework for building and fitting such models in JAX, suitable for many applications. The implementation is fast and memory efficient, scales to large data volumes as in LVM, and can be deployed on hardware accelerators.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the Algol-type binary \textit{Gaia} DR3 1892576067672499328. We identified the system as a spectroscopic binary based on medium-resolution LAMOST spectra. Combined with \textit{TESS} photometry, we determine an orbital period of \( P = 2.47757 (1) \) days, a low mass ratio of \( q = 0.098 \pm 0.002 \), and an orbital inclination of \( i = 46.934^{+2.613}_{-1.11} \) degrees. The orbit is consistent with being circular (\( e = 0 \)). The binary comprises a \( M_1 = 1.817 ^{ +0.106}_{-0.202} \,M_\odot \), \( R_1 = 1.265^{+0.121}_{-0.160}\,R_\odot \) A-type primary and a Roche-lobe-filling secondary of \( M_2 = 0.179 ^{ +0.011}_{-0.020} \,M_\odot \), \( R_2 = 1.994 ^{ +0.041}_{-0.077} \,R_\odot \). The double-peak H$\alpha$ emission line indicates the possible existence of a Keplerian accretion disc. We established a simple standard accretion disc model and modeled the geometric and dynamical properties of the accretion disc. The obtained outer disc radius $R_{\mathrm{out}} \approx 3.36 \pm 0.43\,R_\odot$ is consistent with the values inferred from the emission velocity of H$\alpha$. Systemic velocity variations observed over time suggest the possible presence of a tertiary companion, with a minimum mass of $M_3 > 0.369 \pm 0.024 \,M_\odot$. Given the low mass ratio, the secondary may evolve into a proto-helium white dwarf, forming an \text{EL CVn}-type system in the future. This system offers valuable insights into accretion dynamics and the formation of binaries.         |
