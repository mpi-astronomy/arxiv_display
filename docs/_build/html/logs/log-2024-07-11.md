|**Abstract**|            Relativistic jets are thought to play a crucial role in the formation of massive galaxies and supermassive black holes. Here we report multi-wavelength and multi-epoch observations of the quasar VLASSJ0410-0139 at redshift z=7, powered by a 7e8 solar-mass black hole. Its radio variability, X-ray properties, and compact radio emission on parsec scales reveal that J0410-0139 is a blazar with a relativistic jet aligned with our line of sight. This blazar's existence implies that many more similar (unaligned) jetted sources must exist at z=7. One scenario is that we observe an intrinsically low-power radio jet, but we see it at high luminosity due to relativistic beaming effects. In this case, a large fraction (>80%) of the UV bright quasars must have a similar jet to match the number density expected from the UV quasar luminosity function. These jets can enhance the growth of supermassive black holes and substantially affect their host galaxies. However, the implications would be even more severe if the quasar belongs to the top 10% radio luminous quasars, as measured if the beaming enhancement is less than a factor of 10-15. In this scenario, there should be hundreds to thousands of radio-quiet quasars at z=7 with intrinsic properties similar to J0410-0139 -- in strong tension with the number density of bright quasars derived from their UV luminosity function. To reconcile these results, most black hole growth at z=7 must happen in an obscured phase, as some models predict. The existence of supermassive black holes in the epoch of reionization is facilitated by significant jet-enhanced or obscured super-Eddington accretion.         |

|**Abstract**|            Resolved molecular line observations are essential for gaining insight into the physical and chemical structure of protoplanetary disks, particularly in cold, dense regions where planets form and acquire compositions. However, tracing these regions is challenging because most molecules freeze onto grain surfaces and are not observable in the gas phase. We investigated cold molecular chemistry in the triple stellar T Tauri disk GG Tau A, which harbours a massive gas and dust ring and an outer disk, using ALMA Band 7 observations. We present high angular resolution maps of N2H+ and DCO+ emission, with upper limits reported for H2D+, 13CS, and SO2. The radial intensity profile of N2H+ shows most emission near the ring outer edge, while DCO+ exhibits double peaks, one near the ring inner edge and the other in the outer disk. With complementary observations of lower-lying transitions, we constrained the molecular surface densities and rotation temperatures. We compared the derived quantities with model predictions across different cosmic ray ionization (CRI) rates, carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios, and stellar UV fluxes. Cold molecular chemistry, affecting N2H+, DCO+, and H2D+ abundances, is most sensitive to CRI rates, while stellar UV flux and C/O ratios have minimal impact on these three ions. Our best model requires a low cosmic ray ionization rate of 1e-18 s-1. However, it fails to match the low temperatures derived from N2H+ and DCO+, 12 to 16 K, which are much lower than the CO freezing temperature.         |

|**Abstract**|            Fast X-ray Transients (FXTs) are a new observational class of phenomena with no clear physical origin. This is at least partially a consequence of limited multi-wavelength follow up of this class of transients in real time. Here we present deep optical ($g-$ and $i-$ band) photometry with Keck, and prompt radio observations with the VLA of FXT 210423 obtained at ${\delta t \approx 14-36}$ days since the X-ray trigger. We use these multi-band observations, combined with publicly available data sets, to constrain the presence and physical properties of on-axis and off-axis relativistic jets such as those that can be launched by neutron-star mergers and tidal disruption events, which are among the proposed theoretical scenarios of FXTs. Considering a wide range of possible redshifts $z\le3.5$, circumstellar medium (CSM) density $n={10^{-6}-10^{-1}\,\rm{cm^{-3}}}$, isotropic-equivalent jet kinetic energy $E_{k,iso}={10^{48}-10^{55}\,\rm{erg}}$, we find that we can rule out wide jets with opening angle ${\theta_{j}=15^{\circ}}$ viewed within ${10^{\circ}}$ off-axis. For more collimated jets (${\theta_{j}=3^{\circ}}$) we can only rule out on-axis (${\theta_{j}=0^{\circ}}$) orientations. This study highlights the constraining power of prompt multi-wavelength observations of FXTs discovered in real time by current (e.g., Einstein Probe) and future facilities.         |

|**Abstract**|            Photometric redshifts are widely used in studies of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs), but catastrophic photo-$z$ failure can undermine all redshift-dependent results. Here we report the spectroscopic redshift confirmation of COSBO-7, a strongly lensed DSFG in the COSMOS-PRIMER field. Recently, using 10 bands of JWST NIRCam and MIRI imaging data on COSBO-7, Ling et al. (2024) reported a photometric redshift solution of $z\gtrsim7.0$, favored by four independent spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes, and therefore providing an appealing candidate of the most distant massive DSFG. This photo-$z$ solution was also supported by a single line detection in ALMA Band 3 consistent with CO(7-6) at $z=7.46$. However, our new ALMA observations robustly detect two lines in Band 6 identified as CO(7-6) and [CI](2-1) at $z_{\rm spec}=2.625$, and thus the Band 3 line as CO(3-2). The three robust line detections decidedly place COSBO-7 at $z=2.625$, refuting the photo-$z$ solution. We derive physical parameters by fitting NIR-to-mm photometry and lens modeling, revealing that COSBO-7 is a main-sequence galaxy. We examine possible reasons for this photo-$z$ failure and attribute it to (1) the likely underestimation of photometric uncertainty at 0.9$\mu$m, and (2) the lack of photometry at wavelengths beyond 20$\mu$m. Notably, we recover a bona-fide $z_{\rm phot}\sim 2.3$ by including the existing MIPS $24\mu$m photometry, demonstrating the critical importance of mid-infrared data for photo-$z$ robustness. This work highlights a common challenge in modeling SEDs of DSFGs, cautioning against the reliability of photometric redshifts, as well as pseudo-spectroscopic redshifts based on single line detection.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of TW Hya at 0.65 mm with 0.5 arcsecond angular resolution, together with high angular resolution archival observations at 0.87 mm, 1.3 mm, 2.1 mm and 3.1 mm. We constrain the outer disk emission with both image-plane retrieval, and visibility-plane modeling with non-parametric and parametric fitting tools. Our results confirm emission in the outer disk regions of TW Hya (60 au < R < 110 au) at 0.65 mm, 0.87 mm and 1.3 mm. With image-plane retrieval, we resolve the new continuum gap and ring, namely D79 and B86, at 0.87 mm and 1.3 mm. With visibility-plane modeling, we also detect this substructure at 0.65 mm, and it is consistent in location with the outer ring proposed by Ilee et al. 2022 at the 1-sigma level. Furthermore, it has a high spectral index of 3.7, which may indicate dust grain sizes << 1 mm. It may be a dust trap or a traffic jam, that has a flux density of 60 mJy and a mass (1.59 earth masses) that accounts for up to 2% of the dust disk at 0.65 mm. In conclusion, we confirm the existence of a faint ring in the outer regions of TW Hya at multiple millimeter wavelengths. With visibility-plane modeling, we are able to set constrains that are 3 times better than the resolution of our Band 8 observations.         |

|**Abstract**|            Young brown dwarfs exhibit atmospheric characteristics similar to those of super-Jupiters, providing a unique opportunity to study planetary atmospheres. The ESO SupJup Survey, utilizing CRIRES$^+$ on the Very Large Telescope, aims to assess the role of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C as a formation tracer. We present observations of three young brown dwarfs: 2MASS J12003792-7845082, TWA 28, and 2MASS J08561384-1342242, with the goal of constraining their chemical compositions, thermal profiles, surface gravities, spin rotations, and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C. Atmospheric retrievals of CRIRES$^+$ K-band spectra were conducted using the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS coupled with the Bayesian inference algorithm MultiNest, resulting in a detailed characterization of the atmospheres of these objects. We report the volume mixing ratios of main molecular and atomic species, including the novel detection of hydrogen fluoride (HF) in a brown dwarf's atmosphere, and determine $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C values of $81^{+28}_{-19}$ and $79^{+20}_{-14}$ in the atmospheres of TWA 28 and J0856, respectively, with strong significance ($>3\sigma$). Tentative evidence ($\sim 2\sigma$) of $^{13}$C in J1200 was found, with $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = $114^{+69}_{-33}$, along with $^{18}$O detected at moderate significance in J0856 (3.3$\sigma$) and TWA 28 (2.1$\sigma$). The retrieved thermal profiles indicate hot atmospheres (2300-2600 K) with low surface gravities and slow spins, consistent with young objects. The consistent carbon isotope ratios among the three objects, showing no significant deviation from the local ISM, suggest a fragmentation-based formation mechanism similar to star formation. The tentative detection of $^{18}$O in two objects highlights the potential of high-resolution spectroscopy to probe additional isotope ratios, such as $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O, in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and super-Jupiters.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a comprehensive test of the cosmic distance duality relation (DDR) using a combination of strong gravitational lensing (SGL) time delay measurements and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data. We investigate three different parameterizations of potential DDR violations. To bridge the gap between SGL and SNe Ia datasets, we implement an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to reconstruct the distance modulus of SNe Ia. Our analysis uniquely considers both scenarios where the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia ($M_B$) is treated as a free parameter and where it is fixed to a Cepheid-calibrated value. Using a sample of six SGL systems and the Pantheon+ SNe Ia dataset, we find no statistically significant evidence for DDR violations across all parameterizations. The consistency of our findings across different parameterizations not only reinforces confidence in the standard DDR but also demonstrates the robustness of our analytical approach.         |

|**Abstract**|            Stars in the Galactic disk are born on cold, nearly circular orbits with small vertical excursions. After their birth, their orbits evolve, driven by small- or large-scale perturbations in the Galactic disk's gravitational potential. Here, we study the vertical motions of young stars over their first few orbital periods, using a sample of OBA stars from \textit{Gaia} E/DR3, which includes radial velocities and ages $\tau$ from LAMOST. We constructed a parametric model for the time evolution of the stellar orbits' mean vertical actions $J_z$ as a function of Galactocentric radius, $R_{\mathrm{GC}}$. Accounting for data uncertainties, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis in annuli of Galactocentric radius to constrain the model parameters. Our best-fit model shows a remarkably linear increase of vertical actions with age across all Galactocentric radii examined. Orbital \textit{heating} by random scattering could offer a straightforward interpretation for this trend. However, various other dynamical aspects of the Galactic disk, such as stars being born in a warped disk, might offer alternative explanations that could be tested in the future.         |
