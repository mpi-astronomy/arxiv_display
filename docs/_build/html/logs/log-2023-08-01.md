|**Abstract**| X-shaped Radio Galaxies (XRGs) develop when certain extra-galactic jets deviate from their propagation path. An asymmetric ambient medium (Back-flow model) or complex Active Galactic Nuclei activity (Jet-reorientation model) enforcing the jet direction to deviate may cause such structures. In this context, the present investigation focuses on the modeling of XRGs by performing 3D relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. We implement different jet propagation models applying an initially identical jet-ambient medium configuration to understand distinctive features. This study, the first of its kind, demonstrates that all adopted models produce XRGs with notable properties, thereby challenging the notion of a universal model. Jet reorientation naturally explains several contentious properties of XRGs, including wing alignment along the ambient medium's primary axis, development of collimated lobes, and the formation of noticeably longer wings than active lobes. Such XRGs disrupt the cluster medium by generating isotropic shocks and channeling more energy than the Back-flow scenario. Our synthetic thermal X-ray maps of the cluster medium reveal four `clear' elongated cavities associated with the wing-lobe alignment, regardless of projection effects, though affecting their age estimation. We show depth and geometric alignment of the evolved cavities may qualify as promising characteristics of XRGs, which may be used to disentangle different formation scenarios. |

|**Abstract**| Among more than 800 known fast radio bursts (FRBs), only two, namely FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B, are confirmed to be associated with a persistent radio sources (PRS). Here we report evidence of apparent temporal variability in the PRS associated with the bursting FRB 20190520B based on the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations taken in 2020 and 2021. Based on the analysis of epoch-to-epoch variability of the PRS at L, S, C, and X band in 1-12 GHz, we detected not only overall marginal variability but also a likely radio flux decrease between the observations taken in 2020 and 2021 at 3 GHz. Assuming no spectral variation in the PRS during these observations, we found the evidence for an overall broadband radio flux decrease by about 20 percent between the 2020 and the 2021 observations, suggesting that the PRS probably evolves on the yearly time scale. If we attribute the marginal variability at 3 GHz as intrinsic or due to scintillation, the size of potential variable component of the PRS is constrained to be sub-parsec. On the other hand, the size of the PRS can be also constrained to be larger than about 0.22 parsec from the averaged radio spectrum and the integrated radio luminosity in the 1-12 GHz band based on equipartition and self-absorption arguments. We discuss potential origins of the PRS and suggest that a scenario of accreting compact objects might be able to explain the temporal and spectral properties of the PRS. Confirmation of variability or flux decline of the PRS would be critical to our understanding of the PRS and its relation to the bursting source. |

|**Abstract**| We report the discovery of ZTF J2020+5033, a high-mass brown dwarf (BD) transiting a low-mass star with an orbital period of 1.90 hours. Phase-resolved spectroscopy, optical and infrared light curves, and precise astrometry from Gaia allow us to constrain the masses, radii, and temperatures of both components with few-percent precision. We infer a BD mass of $M_{\rm BD} = 80.1\pm 1.6\,M_{\rm J}$, almost exactly at the stellar/substellar boundary, and a moderately inflated radius, $R_{\rm BD} = 1.05\pm 0.02\,R_{\rm J}$. The transiting object's temperature, $T_{\rm eff}\approx 1700\,\rm K$, is well-constrained by the depth of the infrared secondary eclipse and strongly suggests it is a BD. The system's high tangential velocity ($v_\perp = 98\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$) and thick disk-like Galactic orbit imply the binary is old; its close distance ($d\approx 140$ pc) suggests that BDs in short-period orbits are relatively common. ZTF J2020+5033 is the shortest-period known transiting BD by more than a factor of 7. Today, the entire binary would comfortably fit inside the Sun. However, both components must have been considerably larger in youth, implying that the orbit has shrunk by at least a factor of $\sim 5$ since formation. The simplest explanation is that magnetic braking continues to operate efficiently in at least some low-mass stars and BDs. |

|**Abstract**| The understanding of planet formation has changed recently, embracing the new idea of pebble accretion. This means that the influx of pebbles from the outer regions of planet-forming disks to their inner zones could determine the composition of planets and their atmospheres. The solid and molecular components delivered to the planet-forming region can be best characterized by mid-infrared spectroscopy. With Spitzer low-resolution (R=100, 600) spectroscopy, this approach was limited to the detection of abundant molecules such as H2O, C2H2, HCN and CO2. This contribution will present first results of the MINDS (MIRI mid-IR Disk Survey, PI: Th. Henning) project. Due do the sensitivity and spectral resolution (R~1500-3500) provided by JWST we now have a unique tool to obtain the full inventory of chemistry in the inner disks of solar-types stars and brown dwarfs, including also less abundant hydrocarbons and isotopologues. The Integral Field Unit (IFU) capabilities enable at the same time spatial studies of the continuum and line emission in extended sources such as debris disks, the flying saucer and also the search for mid-IR signatures of forming planets in systems such as PDS70. These JWST observations are complementary to ALMA and NOEMA observations of the outer disk chemistry; together these datasets provide an integral view of the processes occurring during the planet formation phase. |
