|**Abstract**|            High-resolution spectroscopic characterization of young super-Jovian planets enables precise constraints on elemental and isotopic abundances of their atmospheres. As part of the ESO SupJup Survey, we present high-resolution spectral observations of two wide-orbit super-Jupiters in YSES 1 (or TYC 8998-760-1) using the upgraded VLT/CRIRES+ (R~100,000) in K-band. We carry out free atmospheric retrieval analyses to constrain chemical and isotopic abundances, temperature structures, rotation velocities, and radial velocities. We confirm the previous detection of 13CO in YSES 1 b at a higher significance of 12.6{\sigma}, but point to a higher 12CO/13CO ratio of 88+/-13 (1{\sigma} confidence interval), consistent with the primary's isotope ratio 66+/-5. We retrieve a solar-like composition in YSES 1 b with a C/O=0.57+/-0.01, indicating a formation via gravitational instability or core accretion beyond the CO iceline. Additionally, the observations lead to detections of H2O and CO in the outer planet YSES 1 c at 7.3{\sigma} and 5.7{\sigma}, respectively. We constrain the atmospheric C/O ratio of YSES 1 c to be either solar or subsolar (C/O=0.36+/-0.15), indicating the accretion of oxygen-rich solids. The two companions have distinct vsini, 5.34+/-0.14 km/s for YSES 1 b and 11.3+/-2.1 km/s for YSES 1 c, despite their similar natal environments. This may indicate different spin axis inclinations or effective magnetic braking by the long-lived circumplanetary disk around YSES 1 b. YSES 1 represents an intriguing system for comparative studies of super-Jovian companions and linking present atmospheres to formation histories.         |

|**Abstract**|            Around half of the heavy elements in the universe are formed through the slow neutron capture (s-) process, which takes place in thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with masses $1-6\;M_{\odot}$. The nucleosynthetic imprint of the s-process can be studied by observing the material on the surface of binary barium, carbon, CH, and CEMP stars. We study the s-process by observing the luminous components of binary systems polluted by a previous AGB companion. Our radial velocity (RV) monitoring program establishes a collection of binary stars exhibiting enrichment in s-process material for the study of elemental abundances, production of s-process material, and binary mass transfer. From high resolution optical spectra, we measure RVs for 350 stars and derive stellar parameters for 150 stars using ATHOS. For a sub-sample of 24 stars we refine our atmospheric parameters using the Xiru program. We use the MOOG code to compute 1D-LTE abundances of C, Mg, s-process elements Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Pb, and Eu to investigate neutron capture events and stellar chemical composition. We estimate dynamical masses by optimising orbits with MCMC techniques in the ELC program, and we compare our results with low-mass AGB models in the FRUITY database. We find enhancements in s-process material in spectroscopic binaries, a signature of AGB mass transfer. We add Mo to the abundance patterns, and for 12 stars we add Pb detections or upper limits. Computed abundances are in general agreement with the literature. Comparing our abundances to the FRUITY yields, we find correlations in s-process enrichment and AGB mass, and agreements in theoretical and dynamically modelled masses. From our high-resolution observations we expand heavy element abundance patterns and highlight binarity in our chemically interesting systems. We investigate evolutionary stages for a small sub-set of our stars.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2024-09-26*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted for publication in MNRAS. 32 pages (21 of main body and 11 of appendices). Comments welcome!*|
|**Abstract**|            We present a comprehensive study of the star formation histories of massive-quenched galaxies at $z=3$ in 3 semi-analytic models (SHARK, GAEA, GALFORM) and 3 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (EAGLE, Illustris-TNG, Simba). We study the predicted number density and stellar mass function of massive-quenched galaxies, their formation and quenching timescales and star-formation properties of their progenitors. Predictions are disparate in all these diagnostics, for instance: (i) some simulations reproduce the observed number density of very massive-quenched galaxies ($>10^{11}\rm M_{\odot}$) but underpredict the high density of intermediate-mass ones, while others fit well the lower masses but underpredict the higher ones; (ii) In most simulations, except for GAEA and EAGLE, most massive-quenched galaxies had starburst periods, with the most intense ones happening at $4<z<5$; however, only in SHARK and Illustris-TNG we do find a large number of progenitors with star formation rates $>300\rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$; (iii) quenching timescales are in the range $\approx 20-150$~Myr depending on the simulation; among other differences. These disparate predictions can be tied to the adopted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback model. For instance, the explicit black-hole (BH) mass dependence to trigger the "radio mode" in Illustris-TNG and Simba makes it difficult to produce quenched galaxies with intermediate stellar masses, also leading to higher baryon collapse efficiencies ($\approx 15-30$%); while the strong bolometric luminosity dependence of the AGN outflow rate in GAEA leads to BHs of modest mass quenching galaxies. Current observations are unable to distinguish between these different predictions due to the small sample sizes. However, these predictions are testable with current facilities and upcoming observations, allowing a "true physics experiment" to be carried out.         |

|**Abstract**|            Dual Active Galactic Nuclei (dual AGNs), a phase in some galaxy mergers during which both central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are active, are expected to be a key observable stage leading up to SMBH mergers. Constraining the population of dual AGNs in both the nearby and high-z universe has proven to be elusive until very recently. We present a multi-wavelength follow-up campaign to confirm the nature of a sample of 20 candidate dual AGNs at cosmic noon (z~2) from the VODKA sample. Through a combination of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Very Large Array (VLA) imaging, we refute the possibility of gravitational lensing in all but one target. We find evidence of dual AGNs in four systems, while seven exhibit single AGN in galaxy pairs, either through strong radio emission or ancillary emission line data. The remaining systems are either confirmed as quasar-star superpositions (six) or non-lensed pairs (two) that require further investigations to establish AGN activity. Among the systems with radio detections, we find a variety of radio spectral slopes and UV/optical colors suggesting that our sample contains a range of AGN properties, from obscured radio-quiet objects to those with powerful synchrotron-emitting jets. This study presents one of the largest dedicated multi-wavelength follow-up campaigns to date searching for dual AGNs at high redshift. We confirm several of the highest-z systems at small physical separations, thus representing some of the most evolved dual AGN systems at the epoch of peak quasar activity known to date.         |

|| A. Reguitti, et al. -- incl., <mark>M. Ramirez</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-09-26*|

|**Abstract**|            We present an analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic dataset of the Type II supernova (SN) 2018ivc in the nearby (10 Mpc) galaxy Messier 77. Thanks to the high cadence of the CHASE survey, we observed the SN rising very rapidly by nearly three magnitudes in five hours (or 18 mag d$^{-1}$). The $r$-band light curve presents four distinct phases: the maximum light is reached in just one day, then a first, rapid linear decline precedes a short-duration plateau. Finally, a long, slower linear decline lasted for one year. Following a radio rebrightening, we detected SN 2018ivc four years after the explosion. The early spectra show a blue, nearly featureless continuum, but the spectra evolve rapidly: after about 10 days a prominent H$\alpha$ line starts to emerge, with a peculiar profile, but the spectra are heavily contaminated by emission lines from the host galaxy. He I lines, namely $\lambda\lambda$5876,7065, are also strong. On top of the former, a strong absorption from the Na I doublet is visible, indicative of a non-negligible internal reddening. From its equivalent width, we derive a lower limit on the host reddening of $A_V\simeq1.5$ mag, while from the Balmer decrement and a match of the $B-V$ colour curve of SN 2018ivc to that of the comparison objects, a host reddening of $A_V\simeq3.0$ mag is obtained. The spectra are similar to those of SNe II, but with strong He lines. Given the peculiar light curve and spectral features, we suggest SN 2018ivc could be a transitional object between the Type IIL and Type IIb SNe classes. In addition, we found signs of interaction with circumstellar medium in the light curve, making SN 2018ivc also an interacting event. Finally, we modelled the early multi-band light curves and photospheric velocity of SN 2018ivc to estimate the explosion and CSM physical parameters.         |
