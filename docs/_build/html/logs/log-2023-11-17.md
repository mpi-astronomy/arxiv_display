|**Abstract**| Semi-detached binaries are in the stage of mass transfer and play a crucial role in studying mass transfer physics between interacting binaries. Large-scale time-domain surveys provide massive light curves of binary systems, while Gaia offers high-precision astrometric data. In this paper, we develop, validate, and apply a pipeline that combines the MCMC method with a forward model and DBSCAN clustering to search for semi-detached binary and estimate its inclination, relative radius, mass ratio, and temperature ratio using light curve. We train our model on the mock light curves from PHOEBE, which provides broad coverage of light curve simulations for semi-detached binaries. Applying our pipeline to TESS sectors 1-26, we have identified 77 semi-detached binary candidates. Utilizing the distance from Gaia, we determine their masses and radii with median fractional uncertainties of ~26% and ~7%, respectively. With the added 77 candidates, the catalog of semi-detached binaries with orbital parameters has been expanded by approximately 20%. The comparison and statistical results show that our semi-detached binary candidates align well with the compiled samples and the PARSEC model in Teff-L and M-R relations. Combined with the literature samples, comparative analysis with stability criteria for conserved mass transfer indicates that ~97.4% of samples are undergoing nuclear-timescale mass transfer, and two samples (GO Cyg and TIC 454222105) are located within the limits of stability criteria for dynamical- and thermal-timescale mass transfer, which are currently undergoing thermal-timescale mass transfer. Additionally, one system (IR Lyn) is very close to the upper limit of delayed dynamical-timescale mass transfer. |

|**Abstract**| The Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) is a planned radio interferometer providing unprecedented sensitivity at wavelengths between 21 cm and 3 mm. Its 263 antenna element array will be spatially distributed across North America to enable both superb low surface brightness recovery and sub-milliarcsecond angular resolution imaging. The project was developed by the international astronomy community under the lead of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), and is anticipated to be built between 2027 and 2037. Two workshops have been held in 2022 and 2023 with the goal to discuss and consolidate the scientific interests in the ngVLA within the German astronomical community. This community paper constitutes a collection of 41 science ideas which the German community aims to pursue with the ngVLA in the 2030s. This is not a complete list and the ideas are not developed at the level of a "Science Book", such that the present document is mainly to be considered a "living document", to provide a basis for further discussion within the community. As such, additional contributions are welcome, and will be considered for inclusion in future revisions. |
