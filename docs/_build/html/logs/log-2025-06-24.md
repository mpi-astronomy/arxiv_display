|**Abstract**|            We recently identified an upturn in [Na/Fe] for the population of Solar-type stars in the Galactic thick disc ($-0.3 < [\mathrm{Fe/H}] < +0.3$ dex) at super-Solar metallicity in GALactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) data. Here, we investigate the cause of this unexplained Na enrichment between ([Fe/H] $\sim 0 - 0.6$ dex) using the OMEGA$+$ galactic chemical evolution code. We investigate the increase of [Na/Fe] with four combinations of nucleosynthetic yields from the literature, with source contributions from core-collapse supernovae, asymptotic giant branch stars, and Type Ia supernovae. We focus on two possible causes for the Na-enhancement: the "metallicity effect" resulting from core-collapse supernovae at super-Solar metallicity and the contribution of metal-rich AGB stars. We adopt two sets of Type Ia supernova yields with one model assuming only Chandrasekhar-mass explosions, and another assuming only sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions. We find that the assumed Type Ia explosion has little effect on the [Na/Fe] Galactic chemical evolution modelling, and all Galactic chemical evolution models tested fail to reproduce the observed [\mathrm{Na/Fe}] enrichment in the young thick disc population at super-Solar metallicities. Our study indicates a possible "under-pollution effect" by SNe Ia, which are the dominant producers of iron, in the Galactic disc's Solar-type star population. These findings provide a step forward toward understanding the origin of the unexplained sodium enrichment at super-Solar metallicities in the Galactic disc.         |

|**Abstract**|            Improving gamma-hadron separation is one of the most effective ways to enhance the performance of ground-based gamma-ray observatories. With over a decade of continuous operation, the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory has contributed significantly to high-energy astrophysics. To further leverage its rich dataset, we introduce a machine learning approach for gamma-hadron separation. A Multilayer Perceptron shows the best performance, surpassing traditional and other Machine Learning based methods. This approach shows a notable improvement in the detector's sensitivity, supported by results from both simulated and real HAWC data. In particular, it achieves a 19\% increase in significance for the Crab Nebula, commonly used as a benchmark. These improvements highlight the potential of machine learning to significantly enhance the performance of HAWC and provide a valuable reference for ground-based observatories, such as Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) and the upcoming Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO).         |

|**Abstract**|            Open clusters have long been used as tracers of Galactic structure. However, without a selection function to describe the completeness of the cluster census, it is difficult to quantitatively interpret their distribution. We create a method to empirically determine the selection function of a Galactic cluster catalogue. We test it by investigating the completeness of the cluster census in the outer Milky Way, where old and young clusters exhibit different spatial distributions. We develop a method to generate realistic mock clusters as a function of their parameters, in addition to accounting for Gaia's selection function and astrometric errors. We then inject mock clusters into Gaia DR3 data, and attempt to recover them in a blind search using HDBSCAN. We find that the main parameters influencing cluster detectability are mass, extinction, and distance. Age also plays an important role, making older clusters harder to detect due to their fainter luminosity function. High proper motions also improve detectability. After correcting for these selection effects, we find that old clusters are $2.97\pm0.11$ times more common at a Galactocentric radius of 13~kpc than in the solar neighbourhood -- despite positive detection biases in their favour, such as hotter orbits or a higher scale height. The larger fraction of older clusters in the outer Galaxy cannot be explained by an observational bias, and must be a physical property of the Milky Way: young outer-disc clusters are not forming in the outer Galaxy, or at least not with sufficient masses to be identified as clusters in Gaia DR3. We predict that in this region, more old clusters than young ones remain to be discovered. The current presence of old, massive outer-disc clusters could be explained by radial heating and migration, or alternatively by a lower cluster destruction rate in the anticentre.         |

|**Abstract**|            Aims: In this work, we aim to confirm the high albedo of the benchmark ultrahot Neptune LTT9779b using 20 secondary eclipse measurements of the planet observed with CHEOPS. In addition, we perform a search for variability in the reflected light intensity of the planet as a function of time. Methods: First, we used the TESS follow-up data of LTT9779b from three sectors (2, 29, and 69) to remodel the transit signature and estimate an updated set of transit and ephemeris parameters, which were directly used in the modeling of the secondary eclipse lightcurves. This involved a critical noise-treatment algorithm, including sophisticated techniques such as wavelet denoising and Gaussian Process (GP) regression, to constrain noise levels from various sources. In addition to using the officially released reduced aperture photometry data from CHEOPS DRP, we also reduced the raw data using an independent PSF photometry pipeline, known as PIPE, to verify the robustness of our analysis. The extracted secondary eclipse lightcurves were modeled using the PYCHEOPS package, where we have detrended the background noise correlated with the spacecraft roll angle, originating from the inhomogeneous and asymmetric shape of the CHEOPS point spread function, using an N-order glint function. Results: Our independent lightcurve analyses have resulted in consistent estimations of the eclipse depths, with values of 89.9$\pm$13.7 ppm for the DRP analysis and 85.2$\pm$13.1 ppm from PIPE, indicating a high degree of statistical agreement. Adopting the DRP value yields a highly constrained geometric albedo of 0.73$\pm$0.11. No significant eclipse depth variability is detected down to a level of $\sim$37 ppm. Conclusions: Our results confirm that LTT9779b exhibits a strikingly high optical albedo, which substantially reduces the internal energy budget of the planet compared to more opaque...         |

|| <mark>X. Zhang</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-06-24*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            The Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR), a fundamental assumption in modern cosmology, posits a direct link between angular diameter distance and luminosity distance. This study presents a comprehensive, model-independent, and data-driven test of the CDDR using a combination of cosmological observations, including Supernovae (SN), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Hubble parameter ($H(z)$) measurements. We employ both Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and a novel Compressed Point (CPI) method for reconstructing the CDDR, alongside four distinct parameterizations for potential deviations. Nuisance parameters, such as the supernova absolute magnitude and BAO scale, are rigorously handled via both joint numerical fitting (Method I) and analytic marginalization (Method II). Our findings reveal that while direct reconstruction of the CDDR exhibits no significant deviation (less than 1-$\sigma$) under specific prior assumptions, a notable departure emerges when the SH0ES prior is incorporated, suggesting a systematic influence from the Hubble constant tension. Independently, our parameterized analysis corroborates the consistency of CDDR and confirms the equivalence of the two constraint methodologies. We also find no significant evidence for cosmic opacity. A comparative assessment of reconstruction techniques indicates that GPR generally yields higher precision. These results emphasize the critical role of prior choices and statistical methods in CDDR analyses, providing valuable insights into fundamental cosmological principles and the ongoing Hubble tension.         |

|| <mark>X. Zhang</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-06-24*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            In this work, we propose a new model that combines holographic dark energy with modified gravity $f(Q,T)$ to explore a possible explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe. We incorporate the holographic principle into non-metric gravity with non-minimal matter coupling and introduce the Barrow holographic dark energy model to account for a tighter corrections, allowing for a more generalized discussion. Furthermore, we perform parameter estimation using the latest observational data, including Type Ia supernova, BAO and Hubble parameter direct measurements. Our results show that the model provides a theoretical framework to describe late-time cosmic evolution and the universe's accelerated expansion. Despite the additional complexity introduced, the model offers a viable approach for investigating dark energy within modified gravity theories.         |

|| Y.-H. Li, <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-06-24*|
|*Comments*| *8 pages, 4 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            A direct interaction between dark energy and dark matter provides a natural and important extension to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the vacuum energy ($w=-1$) interacting with cold dark matter using the cosmological data from DESI DR2, Planck CMB, and three SNIa samples (PP, DESY5, and Union3). By discretizing the coupling function $\beta(z)$ into 20 redshift bins and assuming a Gaussian smoothness prior, we reconstruct $\beta(z)$ without assuming any specific parameterization. The mean reconstructed $\beta(z)$ changes sign during cosmic evolution, indicating an energy transfer from cold dark matter to dark energy at early times and a reverse flow at late times. At high redshifts, $\beta(z)$ shows a $\sim 2\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. At low redshifts, the results depend on the SNIa sample: CMB+DESI and CMB+DESI+PP yield $\beta(z)$ consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, while CMB+DESI+DESY5 and CMB+DESI+Union3 prefer negative $\beta$ at $\sim2\sigma$. Both $\chi^2$ tests and Bayesian analyses favor the $\beta(z)$ model, with CMB+DESI DR2+DESY5 showing the most significant support through the largest improvement in goodness of fit ($\Delta\chi^2_{\rm MAP}=-17.76$) and strongest Bayesian evidence ($\ln\mathcal{B} = 5.98 \pm 0.69$). Principal component analysis reveals that the data effectively constrain three additional degrees of freedom in the $\beta(z)$ model, accounting for most of the improvement in goodness of fit. Our results demonstrate that the dynamical dark energy preference in current data can be equally well explained by such a sign-reversal interacting dark energy, highlighting the need for future observations to break this degeneracy.         |
