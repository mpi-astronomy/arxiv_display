|**Abstract**| Observations that resolve nearby galaxies into individual regions across multiple phases of the gas-star formation-feedback ``matter cycle'' have provided a sharp new view of molecular clouds, star formation efficiencies, timescales for region evolution, and stellar feedback. We synthesize these results, cover aspects relevant to the interpretation of observables, and conclude that: (1) The observed cloud-scale molecular gas surface density, line width, and internal pressure all reflect the large-scale galactic environment while also appearing mostly consistent with properties of a turbulent medium strongly affected by self-gravity. (2) Cloud-scale data allow for statistical inference of both evolutionary and physical timescales. These suggest that clouds collapse on timescale of order the free-fall or turbulent crossing time ($\sim 10{-}30$~Myr) followed by the formation of massive stars and subsequent rapid ($\lesssim$ 5 Myr) gas clearing. The star formation efficiency per free-fall time is well determined over thousands of regions to be $\epsilon_{\rm ff}\approx 0.5_{-0.3}^{+0.7}\%$. (3) The role of stellar feedback is now measured using multiple observational approaches. The net momentum yield is constrained by the requirement to support the vertical weight of the galaxy disk. Meanwhile, the short gas clearing timescales suggest a large role for pre-supernova feedback in cloud disruption. This leaves the supernovae free to exert a large influence on the larger scale galaxy, including driving turbulence, launching galactic-scale winds, and carving superbubbles. |

|**Abstract**| Robust radiative transfer techniques are requisite for efficiently extracting the physical and chemical information from molecular rotational lines.We study several hypotheses that enable robust estimations of the column densities and physical conditions when fitting one or two transitions per molecular species. We study the extent to which simplifying assumptions aimed at reducing the complexity of the problem introduce estimation biases and how to detect them.We focus on the CO and HCO+ isotopologues and analyze maps of a 50 square arcminutes field. We used the RADEX escape probability model to solve the statistical equilibrium equations and compute the emerging line profiles, assuming that all species coexist. Depending on the considered set of species, we also fixed the abundance ratio between some species and explored different values. We proposed a maximum likelihood estimator to infer the physical conditions and considered the effect of both the thermal noise and calibration uncertainty. We analyzed any potential biases induced by model misspecifications by comparing the results on the actual data for several sets of species and confirmed with Monte Carlo simulations. The variance of the estimations and the efficiency of the estimator were studied based on the Cram{\'e}r-Rao lower bound.Column densities can be estimated with 30% accuracy, while the best estimations of the volume density are found to be within a factor of two. Under the chosen model framework, the peak 12CO(1--0) is useful for constraining the kinetic temperature. The thermal pressure is better and more robustly estimated than the volume density and kinetic temperature separately. Analyzing CO and HCO+ isotopologues and fitting the full line profile are recommended practices with respect to detecting possible biases.Combining a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium model with a rigorous analysis of the accuracy allows us to obtain an efficient estimator and identify where the model is misspecified. We note that other combinations of molecular lines could be studied in the future. |
