|**Abstract**|            Deep surveys reveal tidal debris and associated compact stellar systems. Euclid's unique combination of capabilities (spatial resolution, depth, and wide sky coverage) will make it a groundbreaking tool for galactic archaeology in the local Universe, bringing low surface brightness (LSB) science into the era of large-scale astronomical surveys. Euclid's Early Release Observations (ERO) demonstrate this potential with a field of view that includes several galaxies in the Dorado group. In this paper, we aim to derive from this image a mass assembly scenario for its main galaxies: NGC 1549, NGC 1553, and NGC 1546. We detect internal and external diffuse structures, and identify candidate globular clusters (GCs). By analysing the colours and distributions of the diffuse structures and candidate GCs, we can place constraints on the galaxies' mass assembly and merger histories. The results show that feature morphology, surface brightness, colours, and GC density profiles are consistent with galaxies that have undergone different merger scenarios. We classify NGC 1549 as a pure elliptical galaxy that has undergone a major merger. NGC 1553 appears to have recently transitioned from a late-type galaxy to early type, after a series of radial minor to intermediate mergers. NGC 1546 is a rare specimen of galaxy with an undisturbed disk and a prominent diffuse stellar halo, which we infer has been fed by minor mergers and then disturbed by the tidal effect from NGC 1553. Finally, we identify limitations specific to the observing conditions of this ERO, in particular stray light in the visible and persistence in the near-infrared bands. Once these issues are addressed and the extended emission from LSB objects is preserved by the data-processing pipeline, the Euclid Wide Survey will allow studies of the local Universe to be extended to statistical ensembles over a large part of the extragalactic sky.         |

|**Abstract**|            Neutral hydrogen serves as a crucial probe for the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Actual observations of the 21-cm signal often encounter challenges such as thermal noise and various systematic effects. To overcome these challenges, we simulate SKA-Low-depth images and process them with a deep learning method. We utilized foreground residuals acquired by LOFAR during actual North Celestial Pole field observations, thermal and excess variances calculated via Gaussian process regression, and 21-cm signals generated with 21cmFAST for signal extraction tests. Our approach to overcome these foreground, thermal noise, and excess variance components employs a 3D U-Net neural network architecture for image analysis. When considering thermal noise corresponding to 1400 hours of integration, U-Net provides reliable 2D power spectrum predictions, and robustness tests ensure that we get realistic EoR signals. Adding foreground residuals, however, causes inconsistencies below the horizon delay-line. Lastly, evaluating both thermal and excess variance with observations up to 3700 and 14000 hours ensures reliable power spectrum estimations within the EoR window and across nearly all scales, respectively.         |

|**Abstract**|            The stellar atmospheric parameters and physical properties of stars in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) are of great significance for the study of exoplanets, stellar activity, and asteroseismology. However, despite extensive effort over the past decades, accurate spectroscopic estimates of these parameters are available for only about half of the stars in the full KIC catalog. In our work, by training relationships between photometric colors and spectroscopic stellar parameters from Gaia DR3, the Kepler Issac-Newton Survey, LAMOST DR10, and APOGEE DR17, we have obtained atmospheric-parameter estimates for over 195,000 stars, accounting for 97% of the total sample of KIC stars. We obtain 1{\sigma} uncertainties of 0.1 dex on metallicity [Fe/H], 100 K on effective temperature $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ , and 0.2 dex on surface gravity log $g$. In addition, based on these atmospheric parameters, we estimated the ages, masses, radii, and surface gravities of these stars using the commonly adopted isochrone-fitting approach. The resulting precisions are 20% for ages, 0.1 $M_{\odot}$ for masses, 0.01 $R_{\odot}$ for radii and 0.1 dex for surface gravities. These accurate parameters are expected to provide valuable insights for future studies on various fields.         |

|**Abstract**|            As a major cooling line of interstellar gas, the far-infrared 158 {\mu}m line from singly ionised carbon [CII] is an important tracer of various components of the interstellar medium in galaxies across all spatial and morphological scales. Yet, there is still not a strong constraint on the origins of [CII] emission. In this work, we derive the resolved [CII] star formation rate relation and aim to unravel the complexity of the origin of [CII]. We used the Field-Imaging Far-Infrared Line Spectrometer on board the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy to map [CII] in three nearby star-forming galaxies at sub-kiloparsec scales, namely, NGC 3627, NGC 4321, and NGC 6946, and we compared these [CII] observations to the galactic properties derived from complementary data from the literature. We find that the relationship between the [CII] fine structure line and star formation rate shows variations between the galaxies as well as between different environments within each galaxy. Our results show that the use of [CII] as a tracer for star formation is much more tangled than has previously been suggested within the extragalactic literature, which typically focuses on small regions of galaxies and/or uses large-aperture sampling of many different physical environments. As found within resolved observations of the Milky Way, the picture obtained from [CII] observations is complicated by its local interstellar medium conditions. Future studies will require a larger sample and additional observational tracers, obtained on spatial scales within galaxies, in order to accurately disentangle the origin of [CII] and calibrate its use as a star formation tracer.         |

|**Abstract**|            As part of the BISTRO survey, we present JCMT 850 $\mu$m polarimetric observations towards the Orion Integral-Shaped Filament (ISF) that covers three portions known as OMC-1, OMC-2, and OMC-3. The magnetic field threading the ISF seen in the JCMT POL-2 map appears as a tale of three: pinched for OMC-1, twisted for OMC-2, and nearly uniform for OMC-3. A multi-scale analysis shows that the magnetic field structure in OMC-3 is very consistent at all the scales, whereas the field structure in OMC-2 shows no correlation across different scales. In OMC-1, the field retains its mean orientation from large to small scales, but shows some deviations at small scales. Histograms of relative orientations between the magnetic field and filaments reveal a bimodal distribution for OMC-1, a relatively random distribution for OMC-2, and a distribution with a predominant peak at 90$^\circ$ for OMC-3. Furthermore, the magnetic fields in OMC-1 and OMC-3 both appear to be aligned perpendicular to the fibers, which are denser structures within the filament, but the field in OMC-2 is aligned along with the fibers. All these suggest that gravity, turbulence, and magnetic field are each playing a leading role in OMC-1, 2, and 3, respectively. While OMC-2 and 3 have almost the same gas mass, density, and non-thermal velocity dispersion, there are on average younger and fewer young stellar objects in OMC-3, providing evidence that a stronger magnetic field will induce slower and less efficient star formation in molecular clouds.         |
