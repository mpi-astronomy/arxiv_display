|**Abstract**|            We present optical-to-near infrared (NIR) photometry and spectroscopy of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2024epr, including NIR spectra observed within two days of first light. The early-time optical spectra show strong, high-velocity Ca and Si features near rarely-observed velocities at $\sim$0.1$c$, and the NIR spectra show a \CI\ "knee." Despite these high-velocity features at early times, SN~2024epr evolves into a normal SN Ia, albeit with stronger peak-light Ca absorption than other SNe Ia with the same light curve shape. Although we infer a normal decline rate, $\Delta m_{15}(B)=1.09\pm0.12$ mag, from the light-curve rise, SN 2024epr is a Branch "cool" object and has red early-time colors ($g-r\approx0.15$ mag at $-10$ days). The high velocities point to a density enhancement in the outer layers of the explosion, but thick-shell He-detonation models do not match the smoothly rising light curve or lack of He in our early-time NIR spectra. No current models (e.g., delayed detonation or thin He shell double detonation) appear to reproduce all of the observed properties. Such constraints are only possible for SN 2024epr from the earliest optical and NIR observations, highlighting their importance for constraining SN Ia models. Finally, we find several other SNe Ia with intermediate mass elements at $\sim$30\,000 km s$^{-1}$ within days after the explosion that evolve into otherwise normal SNe Ia at peak light, suggesting the early-time spectra of SNe Ia may hide a broad diversity of observational characteristics.         |

|**Abstract**|            Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) represent a crucial link between the rotation-powered and accretion-powered states of binary pulsars. During their active X-ray state, tMSPs are the only low-mass X-ray binary systems detected up to GeV energies by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). CXOU J110926.4-650224 is a newly discovered tMSP candidate in an active X-ray state, potentially spatially compatible with a faint gamma-ray source listed in the latest Fermi-LAT point-source catalogue as 4FGL J1110.3-6501. Confirming the association between CXOU J110926.4-650224 and the Fermi source is a key step toward validating its classification as a tMSP. In this study, we analyse Fermi-LAT data collected from August 2008 to June 2023 to achieve a more accurate localisation of the gamma-ray source, characterise its spectral properties, and investigate potential time variability. By thoroughly reconstructing the gamma-ray background around the source using a weighted likelihood model, we obtain a new localisation that aligns with the position of the X-ray source at the 95% confidence level, with a Test Statistic value of $\sim 42$. This establishes a spatial association between the gamma-ray source and CXOU J110926.4-650224. The gamma-ray emission is adequately described by a power-law model with a photon index of $\Gamma = 2.5 \pm 0.1$ and a corresponding flux of $(3.7\pm0.9) \times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 0.1-300 GeV range.         |
