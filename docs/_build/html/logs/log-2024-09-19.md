|**Abstract**|            We present a new method to determine the star formation rate (SFR) density of the Universe at $z \gtrsim 5$ that includes the contribution of dust-obscured star formation. For this purpose, we use a [CII] (158 $\mu$m) selected sample of galaxies serendipitously identified in the fields of known $z\gtrsim 4.5$ objects to characterize the fraction of obscured SFR. The advantage of a [CII] selection is that our sample is SFR-selected, in contrast to a UV-selection that would be biased towards unobscured star formation. We obtain a sample of 23 [CII] emitters near star-forming (SF) galaxies and QSOs -- three of which we identify for the first time -- using previous literature and archival ALMA data. 18 of these serendipitously identified galaxies have sufficiently deep rest-UV data and are used to characterize the obscured fraction of the star formation in galaxies with SFRs $\gtrsim 30\ \text{M}_{\odot} \ \text{yr}^{-1}$. We find that [CII] emitters identified around SF galaxies have $\approx$63\% of their SFR obscured, while [CII] emitters around QSOs have $\approx$93\% of their SFR obscured. By forward modeling existing wide-area UV luminosity function (LF) determinations, we derive the intrinsic UV LF using our characterization of the obscured SFR. Integrating the intrinsic LF to $M_{UV}$ = $-$20 we find that the obscured SFRD contributes to $>3\%$ and $>10\%$ of the total SFRD at $z \sim 5$ and $z \sim 6$ based on our sample of companions galaxies near SFGs and QSOs, respectively. Our results suggest that dust obscuration is not negligible at $z\gtrsim 5$, further underlining the importance of far-IR observations of the $z\gtrsim 5$ Universe.         |

|**Abstract**|            Aims. The goal of this work is to comprehensively characterize the impact of stellar multiplicity on Class II disks in the L1641 and L1647 regions of Orion A (~1-3 Myr), part of the Survey of Orion Disks with ALMA (SODA). We characterize the protostellar multiplicity using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the ESO-VISTA, and Hubble Space telescopes. The resulting sample of 65 multiple systems represents the largest catalogue of wide binary systems to date (projected separation >1000 AU), allowing a more robust statistical characterization of the evolution and properties of protoplanetary disks. Methods. The disk population was observed in continuum with ALMA at 225 GHz, with a median rms of 1.5 Mearth. Combining these data (resolution ~1.1arcsec ) with the ESO-VISTA near-infrared survey of the Orion A cloud (resolution ~0.7arcsec ), multiple systems are assembled and selected by an iterative inside-out search in projected separation (>1000 AU). Results. We identify 61 binary systems, 3 triple systems, and one quadruple system. The separation range is between 1000 and 10^4 AU. The dust mass distributions inferred with the Kaplan-Meier estimator yield a median mass of 3.23+0.6-0.4 Mearth for primary disks and 3.88+0.3-0.3 Mearth for secondary disks.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) differs dramatically from our local solar neighbourhood, both in the extreme interstellar medium conditions it exhibits (e.g. high gas, stellar, and feedback density) and in the strong dynamics at play (e.g. due to shear and gas influx along the bar). Consequently, it is likely that there are large-scale physical structures within the CMZ that cannot form elsewhere in the Milky Way. In this paper, we present new results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) large programme ACES (ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey) and conduct a multi-wavelength and kinematic analysis to determine the origin of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring, a molecular cloud with a distinct ring-like morphology. We estimate the projected inner and outer radii of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring to be 79" and 154", respectively (3.1 pc and 6.1 pc at an assumed Galactic Centre distance of 8.2 kpc) and calculate a mean gas density $> 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, a mass of $\sim$ $10^6$ M$_\odot$, and an expansion speed of $\sim$ 20 km s$^{-1}$, resulting in a high estimated kinetic energy ($> 10^{51}$ erg) and momentum ($> 10^7$ M$_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$). We discuss several possible causes for the existence and expansion of the structure, including stellar feedback and large-scale dynamics. We propose that the most likely cause of the M0.8$-$0.2 ring is a single high-energy hypernova explosion. To viably explain the observed morphology and kinematics, such an explosion would need to have taken place inside a dense, very massive molecular cloud, the remnants of which we now see as the M0.8$-$0.2 ring. In this case, the structure provides an extreme example of how supernovae can affect molecular clouds.         |

|**Abstract**|            Accretion among planets is a poorly understood phenomenon, due to lack of both observational and theoretical studies. Detection of emission lines from accreting gas giants facilitate detailed investigations into this process. This work presents a detailed analysis of Balmer lines from one of the few known young, planetary-mass objects with observed emission, the isolated L2 dwarf 2MASS J11151597+1937266 with a mass 7-21 Mj and age 5-45 Myr, located at 45+-2 pc. We obtained the first high-resolution (R~50,000) spectrum of the target with VLT/UVES, a spectrograph in the near-UV to visible wavelengths (3200-6800 AA). We report resolved H3-H6 and He I (5875.6 AA) emission in the spectrum. Based on the asymmetric line profiles of H3 and H4, 10% width of H3 (199+-1 km/s), tentative He I 6678 AA emission and indications of a disk from MIR excess, we confirm ongoing accretion at this object. Using the Gaia update of the parallax, we revise its temperature to 1816+-63 K and radius to 1.5+-0.1 Rj. Analysis of observed H I profiles using 1D planet-surface shock model implies a pre-shock gas velocity of v0=120(+80,-40) km/s and a pre-shock density of log(n0/cm^-3)=14(+0,-5). Pre-shock velocity points to a mass of 6(+8,-4) Mj for the target. Combining the H I line luminosities and planetary Lline-Lacc scaling relations, we derive a mass accretion rate of 1.4(+2.8,-0.9)x10^-8 Mj/yr.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Mittelman-di Cicco-Walker (MDW) H$\alpha$ Sky Survey is an autonomously-operated and ongoing all-sky imaging survey in the narrowband H$\alpha$ wavelength. The survey was founded by amateur astronomers, and is presented here in its first stage of refinement for rigorous scientific use. Each field is exposed through an H$\alpha$ filter with a 3nm bandwidth for a total of four hours, with a pixel scale of 3.2 arcsec. Here, we introduce the first Data Release of the MDW H$\alpha$ Survey (Data Release 0, or DR0), spanning 238 fields in the region of Orion (~3100 deg$^2$). DR0 includes: calibrated mean fields, star-removed mean fields, a point source catalog matched to Data Release 1 of the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS1) and the INT Galactic Plane Survey (IGAPS), and mosaics.         |

|| C. Bassa, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |

|*Comments*| *12 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in A&A*|
|**Abstract**|            We report on the detection of unintended electromagnetic radiation (UEMR) from the second-generation of Starlink satellites. Observations with the LOFAR radio telescope between 10 to 88MHz and 110 to 188MHz show broadband emission covering the frequency ranges from 40 to 70MHz and 110 to 188MHz from the v2-Mini and v2-Mini Direct-to-Cell Starlink satellites. The spectral power flux density of this broadband UEMR varies from satellite to satellite, with values ranging from 15Jy to 1300Jy, between 56 and 66MHz, and from 2 to 100Jy over two distinct 8MHz frequency ranges centered at 120 and 161MHz. We compared the detected power flux densities of this UEMR to that emitted by the first generation v1.0 and v1.5 Starlink satellites. When correcting for the observed satellite distances, we find that the second-generation satellites emit UEMR that is up to a factor of 32 stronger compared to the first generation. The calculated electric field strengths of the detected UEMR exceed typical electromagnetic compatibility standards used for commercial electronic devices as well as recommended emission thresholds from the Radiocommunication Sector of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU-R) aimed at protecting the 150.05-153MHz frequency range allocated to radio astronomy. We characterize the properties of the detected UEMR with the aim of assisting the satellite operator with the identification of the cause of the UEMR.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2024-09-19*|

|**Abstract**|            We explore the physical properties of five massive quiescent galaxies at $z\sim2.5$, revealing the presence of non-negligible dust reservoirs. JWST NIRSpec observations were obtained for each target, finding no significant line emission; multiple star formation tracers independently place upper limits between $0.1-10~M_\odot / \mathrm{yr}$. Spectral energy distribution modeling with Prospector infers stellar masses between $\log_{10}[M / M_\odot] \sim 10-11$ and stellar mass-weighted ages between $1-2$ Gyr. The inferred mass-weighted effective radii ($r_{eff}\sim 0.4-1.4$ kpc) and inner $1$ kpc stellar surface densities ($\log_{10}[\Sigma / M_\odot \mathrm{kpc}^2 ]\gtrsim 9$) are typical of quiescent galaxies at $z \gtrsim 2$. The galaxies display negative color gradients (redder core and bluer outskirts); for one galaxy, this effect results from a dusty core, while for the others it may be evidence of an "inside-out" growth process. Unlike local quiescent galaxies, we identify significant reddening in these typical cosmic noon passive galaxies; all but one require $A_V \gtrsim 0.4$. This finding is in qualitative agreement with previous studies but our deep 20-band NIRCam imaging is able to significantly suppress the dust-age degeneracy and confidently determine that these galaxies are reddened. We speculate about the physical effects that may drive the decline in dust content in quiescent galaxies over cosmic time.         |

|| Y. Zhu, et al. -- incl., <mark>A. d. Graaff</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-09-19*|
|*Comments*| *21 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables. Submitted to AAS journals*|
|**Abstract**|            For the first time, we systematically search for galaxies with extended emission line and potential outflows features using medium-band images in the GOODS-S field by comparing the morphology in medium-band images to adjacent continuum and UV bands. We look for galaxies that have a maximum extent 50\% larger, an excess area 30\% greater, or an axis ratio difference of more than 0.3 in the medium band compared to the reference bands. After visual inspection, we find 326 candidate galaxies at $1 < z < 6$, with a peak in the population near cosmic noon, benefiting from the good coverage of the medium-band filters. By examining their SEDs, we find that the candidate galaxies are at least 20\% more bursty in their star-forming activity and have 60\% more young stellar populations compared to a control sample selected based on the continuum band flux. Additionally, these candidates exhibit a significantly higher production rate of ionizing photons. We further find that candidates hosting known AGN produce extended emission that is more anisotropic compared to non-AGN candidates. A few of our candidates have been spectroscopically confirmed to have prominent outflow signatures through NIRSpec observations, showcasing the robustness of the photometric selection. Future spectroscopic follow-up will better help verify and characterize the kinematics and chemical properties of these systems.         |
