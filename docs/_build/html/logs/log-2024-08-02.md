|**Abstract**|            The Hubble Tension, a >5 sigma discrepancy between direct and indirect measurements of the Hubble constant (H0), has persisted for a decade and motivated intense scrutiny of the paths used to infer H0. Comparing independently-derived distances for a set of galaxies with different standard candles, such as the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and Cepheid variables, can test for systematics in the middle rung of the distance ladder. The I band is the preferred filter for measuring the TRGB due to constancy with color, a result of low sensitivity to population differences in age and metallicity supported by stellar models. We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations with the maser host NGC 4258 as our geometric anchor to measure I-band (F090W vs F090W-F150W) TRGB distances to 7 hosts of 9 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) within 27 Mpc: NGC 1448, NGC 1559, NGC 2525, NGC 3370, NGC 3447, NGC 5584, and NGC 5643. We compare these with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cepheid-based relative distance moduli for the same galaxies and anchor. We find no evidence of a difference between their weighted means, 0.01 +/- 0.04 (stat) +/- 0.04 (sys) mag. We produce fourteen variants of the TRGB analysis, altering the smoothing level and color range used to measure the tips to explore their impact. For some hosts, this changes the identification of the strongest peak, but this causes little change to the sample mean difference producing a full range of 0.01 to 0.03 mag, all consistent at 1 sigma with no difference. The result matches past comparisons of I-band TRGB and Cepheids when both use HST. SNe and anchor samples observed with JWST are too small to yield a measure of H0 that is competitive with the HST sample of 42 SNe Ia and 4 anchors; however, they already provide a vital systematic crosscheck to HST measurements of the distance ladder.         |

|**Abstract**|            Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are compact binary systems in which a white dwarf accretes matter from a Roche-lobe-filling companion star. In this study, we searched for new CVs in the Milky Way in the Chandra Source Catalog v2.0, cross-matched with Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). We identified new CV candidates by combining X-ray and optical data in a color-color diagram called the ``X-ray Main Sequence". We used two different cuts in this diagram to compile pure and optically variable samples of CV candidates. We undertook optical spectroscopic follow-up observations with the Keck and Palomar Observatories to confirm the nature of these sources. We assembled a sample of 25,887 Galactic X-ray sources and found 14 new CV candidates. Seven objects show X-ray and/or optical variability. All sources show X-ray luminosity in the $\rm 10^{29}-10^{32}$ $\rm erg\ s^{-1}$ range, and their X-ray spectra can be approximated by a power-law model with photon indices in the $\rm \Gamma \sim 1-3$ range or an optically thin thermal emission model in the $\rm kT \sim 1-70$ keV range. We spectroscopically confirmed four CVs, discovering two new polars, one low accretion rate polar and a WZ~Sge-like low accretion rate CV. X-ray and optical properties of the other 9 objects suggest that they are also CVs (likely magnetic or dwarf novae), and one other object could be an eclipsing binary, but revealing their true nature requires further observations. These results show that a joint X-ray and optical analysis can be a powerful tool for finding new CVs in large X-ray and optical catalogs. X-ray observations such as those by Chandra are particularly efficient at discovering magnetic and low accretion rate CVs, which could be missed by purely optical surveys.         |

|| J.-D. Pan, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-08-02*|

|**Abstract**|            Precise cosmological measurements are essential for understanding the evolution of the universe and the nature of dark energy. The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), the most sensitive single-dish radio telescope, has the potential to provide the precise cosmological measurements through neutral hydrogen 21-cm intensity mapping sky survey. This paper primarily explores the potential of technological upgrades for FAST in cosmology. The most crucial upgrade begins with equipping FAST with a wide-band receiver ($0 < z < 2.5$). This upgrade can enable FAST to achieve higher precision in cosmological parameter estimation than the Square Kilometre Array Phase-1 Mid frequency. On this basis, expanding to a FAST array (FASTA) consisting of six identical FAST would offer significant improvements in precision compared to FAST. Additionally, compared with the current results from the data combination of cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations (optical galaxy surveys), and type Ia supernovae, FASTA can provide comparable constraints. Specifically, for the dark-energy equation-of-state parameters, FASTA can achieve $\sigma(w_0) = 0.09$ and $\sigma(w_a) = 0.33$.         |

|| S.-R. Xiao, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-08-02*|
|*Comments*| *15 pages, 7 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            Recently, several pulsar timing array (PTA) projects have detected evidence of the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nanohertz frequency band, providing confidence in detecting individual supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the future. Nanohertz GWs emitted by inspiraling SMBHBs encode the luminosity distances of SMBHBs. They can serve as dark sirens to explore the cosmic expansion history via a statistical method to obtain the redshift information of GW sources' host galaxies using galaxy catalogs. The theoretical analysis of the dark siren method relies on the modeling of the population of SMBHBs. Using a population model consistent with the latest SGWB observations is essential, as the SGWB provides significant information about the distribution of SMBHBs. In this work, we employ a quasar-based model, which can self-consistently account for the SGWB amplitude, to estimate the population of SMBHBs. We constrain the Hubble constant using the mock GW data from different detection cases of PTAs in the future. Our results show that a PTA consisting of 100 pulsars with a white noise level of 20 ns could measure the Hubble constant with a precision close to $1\%$ over a 10-year observation period, and a PTA with 200 pulsars may achieve this goal over a 5-year observation period. The results indicate that modeling the SMBHB population significantly influences the analysis of dark sirens, and SMBHB dark sirens have the potential to be developed as a valuable cosmological probe.         |

|| T. M. Cornish, et al. -- incl., <mark>F. Walter</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-08-02*|

|**Abstract**|            Submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) are some of the most extreme star-forming systems in the Universe, whose place in the framework of galaxy evolution is as yet uncertain. It has been hypothesised that SMGs are progenitors of local early-type galaxies, requiring that SMGs generally reside in galaxy cluster progenitors at high redshift. We test this hypothesis and explore SMG environments using a narrowband VLT/HAWK-I+GRAAL study of H$\alpha$ and [OIII] emitters around an unbiased sample of three ALMA-identified and spectroscopically-confirmed SMGs at $z \sim 2.3$ and $z \sim 3.3$, where these SMGs were selected solely on spectroscopic redshift. Comparing with blank-field observations at similar epochs, we find that one of the three SMGs lies in an overdensity of emission-line sources on the $\sim4$ Mpc scale of the HAWK-I field of view, with overdensity parameter $\delta_{g} = 2.6^{+1.4}_{-1.2}$. A second SMG is significantly overdense only on $\lesssim 1.6$ Mpc scales and the final SMG is consistent with residing in a blank field environment. The total masses of the two overdensities are estimated to be $\log(M_{h}/{\rm M}_{\odot}) =$12.1--14.4, leading to present-day masses of $\log(M_{h,z=0}/{\rm M}_{\odot}) =$12.9--15.9. These results imply that SMGs occupy a range of environments, from overdense protoclusters or protogroups to the blank field, suggesting that while some SMGs are strong candidates for the progenitors of massive elliptical galaxies in clusters, this may not be their only possible evolutionary pathway.         |

|| P. E. Johnson, L. A. Young, D. Nesvorny, <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-08-02*|
|*Comments*| *accepted for publication in the Planetary Science Journal*|
|**Abstract**|            We estimate the loss of nitrogen from Pluto over its lifetime, including the giant planet instability period, which we term the "Wild Years." We analyze the orbital migration of 53 simulated Plutinos, which are Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) captured into 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Neptune during the instability. This orbital migration brought the Plutinos from 20 to 30 au to their present-day orbits near 40 au along a nonlinear path that includes orbits with semimajor axes from 10 to 100 au. We model the thermal history that results from this migration and estimate the volatile loss rates due to the ever-changing thermal environment. Due to the early Sun's enhanced ultraviolet radiation, the photochemical destruction rate during the Wild Years was a factor of 100 higher than the present-day rate, but this only results in a loss of ~10 m global equivalent layer (GEL). The enhanced Jeans escape rate varies wildly with time, and a net loss of ~100 cm GEL is predicted. Additionally, we model the impact history during the migration and find that impacts are a net source, not loss, of N2, contributing ~100 cm GEL. The 100 cm GEL is 0.1% of the amount of N2 in Sputnik Planitia. We therefore conclude that Pluto did not lose an excessive amount of volatiles during the Wild Years, and its primordial volatile inventory can be approximated as its present-day inventory. However, significant fractions of this small total loss of N2 occurred during the Wild Years, so estimates made using present-day rates will be underestimates.         |
