|**Abstract**|            For time-domain astronomy, it is crucial to frequently image celestial objects at specific depths within a predetermined cadence. To fulfill these scientific demands, scientists globally have started or planned the development of non-interferometric telescope arrays in recent years. Due to the numerous parameters involved in configuring these arrays, there is a need for an automated optimization framework that selects parameter sets to satisfy scientific needs while minimizing costs. In this paper, we introduce such a framework, which integrates optical design software, an exposure time calculator, and an optimization algorithm, to balance the observation capabilities and the cost of optical telescope arrays. Neural networks are utilized to speed up results retrieval of the system with different configurations. We use the SiTian project as a case study to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, showing that this approach can aid scientists in selecting optimal parameter sets. The code for this framework is published in the China Virtual Observatory PaperData Repository, enabling users to optimize parameters for various non-interferometric telescope array projects.         |

|**Abstract**|            Using observations from GMRT and FAST, we conducted multi-wavelength studies on PSR J1948+3540 and analyzed its intensity modulation characteristics in detail. We found that the intensity modulation of this pulsar exhibits broad low-frequency modulation features. The modulation frequency/period is time-dependent, but the dominant modulation component varies with the observing frequency. Specifically, at low frequencies, the modulation is dominated by the first half of the middle component, while at high frequencies, it is dominated by the second half of the middle component. Spectral analysis revealed that the intensities of the leading and trailing components vary with the observing frequency, but the middle component does not change significantly. Besides, the polarization analyses reveal that the peak of the radiation intensity is located in the latter half of the middle component, whereas the linear polarization is dominant in the former half. However, due to the low degree of linear polarization, the change of the dominant modulation component with the observed frequency is not caused by the variation in linear polarization. The phenomenon of the dominant modulation component varying with observing frequency has not been reported before and remains difficult to understand within the current theoretical framework.         |

|| M. Liu, et al. -- incl., <mark>Y. Wang</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            Aiming at a general description of four basic solutions describing the accretion processes, i.e., the Shakura-Sunyaev thin disc (SSD), the Shapiro-Lightman-Eardley solution (SLE), the slim disc, and the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF), we present generalized axisymmetric height-averaged equations, where the entropy advection, the radiation pressure, and photon trapping effect are all included self-consistently. Our generalized solution can reproduce the ADAF, SLE, SSD, and slim disc branches in a wide range of accretion rates from sub- to super-Eddington accretion. An S-curve in the $\dot{m}-\Sigma$ plane is also reproduced, representing the SSD branch, the radiation-pressure-dominant branch, and the slim disc branch. The solution gives a natural transition between SSD and slim disc when photon trapping occurs in the accretion flow, producing a radially hybrid SSD-slim disc structure in a certain range of accretion rates. The coexistence of ADAF and SSD below a critical accretion rate is clearly shown with distinct advection fraction of accretion energy. We also present the luminosity, radiation efficiency, and spectrum from the generalized solutions for a large range of accretion rates in stellar mass black holes.         |
