|**Abstract**| We present new $^{13}$CO(1-0), C$^{18}$O(1-0), HCO$^{+}$(1-0) and H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$(1-0) maps from the IRAM 30m telescope, and a spectrally-resolved [CII] 158 $\mu$m map observed with the SOFIA telescope towards the massive DR21 cloud. This traces the kinematics from low- to high-density gas in the cloud which allows to constrain the formation scenario of the high-mass star forming DR21 ridge. The molecular line data reveals that the sub-filaments are systematically redshifted relative to the dense ridge. We demonstrate that [CII] unveils the surrounding CO-poor gas of the dense filaments in the DR21 cloud. We also show that this surrounding gas is organized in a flattened cloud with curved redshifted dynamics perpendicular to the ridge. The sub-filaments thus form in this curved and flattened mass reservoir. A virial analysis of the different lines indicates that self-gravity should drive the evolution of the ridge and surrounding cloud. Combining all results we propose that bending of the magnetic field, due to the interaction with a mostly atomic colliding cloud, explains the velocity field and resulting mass accretion on the ridge. This is remarkably similar to what was found for at least two nearby low-mass filaments. We tentatively propose that this scenario might be a widespread mechanism to initiate star formation in the Milky Way. However, in contrast to low-mass clouds, gravitational collapse plays a role on the pc scale of the DR21 ridge because of the higher density. This allows more effective mass collection at the centers of collapse and should facilitate massive cluster formation. |

|**Abstract**| We study a Jupiter-mass planet formation for the first time in radiative magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) simulations and compare it with pure hydrodynamical simulations, as well as to different isothermal configurations. We found that the meridional circulation is the same in every setup. The planetary spiral wakes drive a vertical stirring inside the protoplanetary disc and the encounter with these shock fronts also helps in delivering gas vertically onto the Hill-sphere. The accretion dynamics are unchanged: the planet accretes vertically, and there is outflow in the midplane regions inside the Hill-sphere. We determined the effective $\alpha$-viscosity generated in the disc by the various angular momentum loss mechanisms, which showed that magnetic fields produce high turbulence in the ideal MHD limit, that grows from $\alpha \sim 10^{-2.5}$ up to $\sim 10^{-1.5}$ after the planet spirals develop. In the HD simulations, the planetary spirals contribute to $\alpha \sim 10^{-3}$, making this a very important angular momentum transport mechanism. Due to the various $\alpha$ values in the different setups, the gap opening is different in each case. In the radiative MHD setups, the high turbulent viscosity prevents gap opening, leading to a higher Hill mass, and no clear dust trapping regions. While the Hill accretion rate is $10^{-6} \rm{M_{Jup}/yr}$ in all setups, the accretion variability is orders of magnitude higher in radiative runs than in isothermal ones. Finally, with higher-resolution runs, the magneto-rotational instability started to be resolved, changing the effective viscosity and increasing the heating in the disc. |

|**Abstract**| The linear stability analysis of a stratified rotating fluid (see paper I) showed that disks with a baroclinic stratification under the influence of thermal relaxation will become unstable to thermal instabilities. One instability is the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability (GSF), which is the local version of the Vertical Shear Instability (VSI) and the other is a thermal overstability, the Convective Overstability (COS). In the present paper we reproduce the analytic predicted growth rates for both instabilities in numerical experiments of small axisymmetric sections of vertically isothermal disks with a radial temperature gradient, especially for cooling times longer than the critical cooling time for VSI. In this cooling time regime our simulations reveal the simultaneous and independent growth of both modes: COS and GSF. We consistently observe that GSF modes exhibit a faster growth rate compared to COS modes. Near the midplane, GSF modes eventually stop growing, while COS modes continue to grow and ultimately dominate the flow pattern. Away from the midplane, we find GSF modes to saturate, when bands of constant angular momentum have formed. In these bands we observe the formation and growth of eddies driven by the baroclinic term, further enhancing the velocity perturbations. In geophysics this effect is known as horizontal convection or sea-breeze instability. Three-dimensional simulations will have to show whether similar effects will occur when axisymmetry is not enforced. Our local simulations help to reveal the numerical resolution requirements to observe thermal instabilities in global simulations of disks around young stars. |
