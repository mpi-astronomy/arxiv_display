|**Abstract**|            The disk around PDS 70 hosts two directly imaged protoplanets in a gap. Previous VLT/SPHERE and recent James Webb Space Telescope/NIRCam observations have hinted at the presence of a third compact source in the same gap at ~13 au, interior to the orbit of PDS 70 b. We reduce seven published and one unpublished VLT/SPHERE datasets in YJH and K bands, as well as an archival VLT/NaCo dataset in L' band, and an archival VLT/SINFONI dataset in H+K band. We combine angular-, spectral- and reference star differential imaging to search for protoplanet candidates. We recover the compact source in all epochs, consistent with the JWST detection, moving on an arc that can be fit by Keplerian motion of a protoplanet which could be in a resonance with PDS 70 b & c. We find that the spectral slope is overall consistent with the unresolved star and inner disk emission at 0.95--1.65$\mu$m, which suggests a dust scattering dominated spectrum. An excess beyond 2.3$\mu$m could be thermal emission from either a protoplanet or heated circumplanetary dust, variability, or inner disk contamination, and requires confirmation. While we currently cannot rule out a moving inner disk feature or a dust clump associated with an unseen planet, the data supports the hypothesis of a third protoplanet in this remarkable system.         |

|**Abstract**|            Hot- and cold-start planet formation models predict differing luminosities for the young, bright planets that direct imaging surveys are most sensitive to. However, precise mass estimates are required to distinguish between these models observationally. The presence of two directly imaged planets, PDS 70 b and c, in the PDS 70 protoplanetary disk provides us a unique opportunity for dynamical mass measurements, since the masses for these planets are currently poorly constrained. Fitting orbital parameters to new astrometry of these planets, taken with VLTI/GRAVITY in the $K$~band, we find $2\sigma$ dynamical upper mass limits of 4.9 $M_{\rm Jup}$ for b and 13.6 $M_{\rm Jup}$ for c. Adding astrometry from the newly proposed planet candidate PDS 70 d into our model, we determine $2\sigma$ dynamical upper mass limits of 5.3 $M_{\rm Jup}$, 7.5 $M_{\rm Jup}$ and 2.2 $M_{\rm Jup}$ for b, c, and the candidate d respectively. However, $N$-body analysis of the orbits fit in this case suggest that the inclusion of $d$ makes the system unstable. Using the upper mass limits for b and c we rule out the coldest-start formation models for both planets, calculating minimum post-formation entropies ($S_i$) of 9.5 $k_{\rm B}/{\rm baryon}$ and 8.4 $k_{\rm B}/{\rm baryon}$ respectively. This places PDS 70 b and c on the growing list of directly-imaged planets inconsistent with cold-start formation.         |

|**Abstract**|            2MASS J04381486+2611399 (or J0438) is one of the few young brown dwarfs (BD) with a highly inclined ($i\!\sim\!70^\circ$) disk. Here we report results from JWST-MIRI MRS, HST-ACS and ALMA Band 7 observations. Despite its late spectral type (M7.25), the spectrum of J0438 resembles those of inner disks around earlier-type stars (K1-M5, T Tauri stars), with a volatile reservoir lacking hydrocarbons (except for acetylene, C$_2$H$_2$) and dominated by water. Other identified species are H$_2$, CO$_2$, HCN, [Ar$^{+}$], and [Ne$^{+}$]. The dominance of water over hydrocarbons is driven by multiple factors such as disk dynamics, young disk age, low accretion rate and possible inner disk clearing. J0438 appears highly dynamic, showing a seesaw-like variability and extended emission in H$_2 \,\,\, S$(1), $S$(3), $S$(5), [Ne$^{+}$] and CO ($J=3-2$). Interestingly, the CO emission reaches up to 400 au from the brown dwarf, suggesting ongoing infalling/outflowing activity impacting the disk chemistry. These observations underscore the combined power of JWST, HST and ALMA in characterizing the chemical diversity and dynamics of brown dwarf disks.         |

|**Abstract**|            Infrared observations of the inner disks around very low-mass stars (VLMS, $<$0.3$\,M_{\odot}$) have revealed a carbon-rich gas composition in the terrestrial planet-forming regions. Contrary to the typically water-rich T Tauri disk spectra, only two disks around VLMS have been observed to be water-rich among more than ten VLMS disks observed so far with JWST/MIRI. In this letter, we systematically search for the presence of water and other oxygen-bearing molecules in the JWST/MIRI spectra of ten VLMS disks from the MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS). In addition to the two previously reported detections of water emission in this VLMS sample, we detect water emission in the spectra of three other sources and tentatively in one source, and we provide strong evidence for water emission in the remaining disks in the MINDS sample, most of which have bright emission from carbon-bearing molecules. We show that the $\rm C_2H_2$ emission is much stronger than that of water for sources with low luminosities, and the hydrocarbons outshine the water emission in such conditions. We propose that the appearance of water-rich vs. hydrocarbon-rich spectra is related to the location of the water reservoir in the disk relative to the main hydrocarbon reservoir. Our findings indicate that the terrestrial planet forming regions in VLMS disks have high carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O$>$1), but can still harbor ample water similar to those in the T Tauri disks.         |

|**Abstract**|            We study the launching of magnetized jets from a resistive circumstellar disk within a binary system, employing a unique combination of 3D MHD jet launching simulations (PLUTO code) and post-processed 3D radiative transfer modeling (RADMC-3D code). Our findings reveal a well-defined jet originating from the inner region of the disk, extending to a larger disk area. While the model attains steady states for a single star, a binary system leads to the emergence of tidal effects such as the formation of ``spiral arms'' in the disk and inside the jet. Here we have consistently implemented a time-dependent Roche potential for the gravity of the binary. As a major step forward, we further present the first 3D radiation maps of the dust continuum for the disk-jet structure. In principle, this allows us to compare MHD simulation results to observed disk-outflow features. We, therefore, present convolved images of the dust continuum emission, employing exemplary point spread functions of the MIRI instrument (5~$\mu m$ band) and the ALMA array (320~$\mu m$ band). In these bands, we identify distinguishable features of the disk-jet structure, such as "spiral arms," which we have also seen in the MHD this http URL gas density increased by an order of magnitude, the disk become optically thick at 5~$\mu m$, but remains bright at 320~$\mu$m. At this wavelength, 320~$\mu$m, enhanced structural features in the disk and the base of the wind become more pronounced and are well resolved in the convolved image.         |

|**Abstract**|            Spatial data fusion is a bottleneck when it meets the scale of 10 billion records. Cross-matching celestial catalogs is just one example of this. To challenge this, we present a framework that enables efficient cross-matching using Learned Index Structures. Our approach involves a data transformation method to map multi-dimensional data into easily learnable distributions, coupled with a novel search algorithm that leverages the advantages of model pairs, significantly enhancing the efficiency of nearest-neighbor search. In this study, we utilized celestial catalog data derived from astronomical surveys to construct the index and evaluated the speed of the cross-matching process. Using the HEALPix segmentation scheme, we built an independent model object for each tile and developed an end-to-end pipeline to construct a framework with semantic guarantees for record retrieval in query and range search. Our results show that the proposed method improves cross-matching speed by more than four times compared to KD-trees for a radius range between 1 milli-arcseconds and 100 arcseconds.         |
