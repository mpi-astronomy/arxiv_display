|**Abstract**| The Euclid mission will conduct an extragalactic survey over 15000 deg$^2$ of the extragalactic sky. The spectroscopic channel of the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) has a resolution of $R\sim450$ for its blue and red grisms that collectively cover the $0.93$--$1.89 $\micron;range. NISP will obtain spectroscopic redshifts for $3\times10^7$ galaxies for the experiments on galaxy clustering, baryonic acoustic oscillations, and redshift space distortion. The wavelength calibration must be accurate within $5$\AA to avoid systematics in the redshifts and downstream cosmological parameters. The NISP pre-flight dispersion laws for the grisms were obtained on the ground using a Fabry-Perot etalon. Launch vibrations, zero gravity conditions, and thermal stabilisation may alter these dispersion laws, requiring an in-flight recalibration. To this end, we use the emission lines in the spectra of compact planetary nebulae (PNe), which were selected from a PN data base. To ensure completeness of the PN sample, we developed a novel technique to identify compact and strong line emitters in Gaia spectroscopic data using the Gaia spectra shape coefficients. We obtained VLT/X-SHOOTER spectra from $0.3$ to $2.5$ \micron;for 19 PNe in excellent seeing conditions and a wide slit, mimicking Euclid's slitless spectroscopy mode but with 10 times higher spectral resolution. Additional observations of one northern PN were obtained in the $0.80$--$1.90$ \micron range with the GMOS and GNIRS instruments at the Gemini North observatory. The collected spectra were combined into an atlas of heliocentric vacuum wavelengths with a joint statistical and systematic accuracy of 0.1 \AA in the optical and 0.3 \AA in the near-infrared. The wavelength atlas and the related 1D and 2D spectra are made publicly available. |

|**Abstract**| [Abridged] Aims. We provide an important step toward a better understanding of the magnetorotational instability (MRI)-dust coevolution in protoplanetary disks by presenting a proof of concept that dust evolution ultimately plays a crucial role in the MRI activity. Methods. First, we study how a fixed power-law dust size distribution with varying parameters impacts the MRI activity, especially the steady-state MRI-driven accretion, by employing and improving our previous 1+1D MRI-driven turbulence model. Second, we relax the steady-state accretion assumption in this disk accretion model, and partially couple it to a dust evolution model in order to investigate how the evolution of dust (dynamics and grain growth processes combined) and MRI-driven accretion are intertwined on million-year timescales. Results. Dust coagulation and settling lead to a higher gas ionization degree in the protoplanetary disk, resulting in stronger MRI-driven turbulence as well as a more compact dead zone. On the other hand, fragmentation has an opposite effect because it replenishes the disk in small dust particles. Since the dust content of the disk decreases over million years of evolution due to radial drift, the MRI-driven turbulence overall becomes stronger and the dead zone more compact until the disk dust-gas mixture eventually behaves as a grain-free plasma. Furthermore, our results show that dust evolution alone does not lead to a complete reactivation of the dead zone. Conclusions. The MRI activity evolution (hence the temporal evolution of the MRI-induced $\alpha$-parameter) is controlled by dust evolution and occurs on a timescale of local dust growth, as long as there is enough dust particles in the disk to dominate the recombination process for the ionization chemistry. Once it is no longer the case, it is expected to be controlled by gas evolution and occurs on a viscous evolution timescale. |

|**Abstract**| High-energy processes are ubiquitous even in the earliest stages of protostellar evolution. Motivated by the results of our systematic search for intense centimeter radio flares in Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) and by rare findings of strong millimeter-wavelength variability, we have conducted a systematic search for such variability in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Rapid variability on timescales of minutes to hours in the (centimeter)millimeter-wavelength range indicates (gyro)synchrotron radiation. Additionally, mass accretion will also affect the millimeter-wavelength luminosity but typically on longer timescales. Beyond studies of individual YSOs, our characterization of strong millimeter-wavelength variability with ALMA in the ONC sets first systematic constraints on the occurrence of such variability in a large number of YSOs ($\sim$130). We report the discovery of an order of magnitude millimeter-flare within just a few minutes from a known YSO previously reported as a radio flaring source at cm-wavelengths (the "ORBS'' source). We also present an assessment of the systematic variability effects caused by the use of time-sliced imaging of a complex region. These are mostly due to the impact of a changing synthesized beam throughout the observations. We use simulated ALMA observations to reproduce and quantify these effects and set a lower limit for the variability that can be studied using our method in a complex region such as the ONC. Our results demonstrate that the utility of time domain analysis of YSOs extends into the millimeter-wavelength range, potentially interfering with the conversion of observed fluxes into dust masses. |

|**Abstract**| Measuring broad emission-line widths in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is not straightforward owing to the complex nature of flux variability in these systems. Line-width measurements become especially challenging when signal-to-noise is low, profiles are narrower, or spectral resolution is low. We conducted an extensive correlation analysis between emission-line measurements from the optical spectra of Markarian 142 (Mrk 142; a narrow-line Seyfert galaxy) taken with the Gemini North Telescope (Gemini) at a spectral resolution of 185.6+\-10.2 km/s and the Lijiang Telescope (LJT) at 695.2+\-3.9 km/s to investigate the disparities in the measured broad-line widths from both telescope data. Mrk~142 posed a challenge due to its narrow broad-line profiles, which were severely affected by instrumental broadening in the lower-resolution LJT spectra. We discovered that allowing the narrow-line flux of permitted lines having broad and narrow components to vary during spectral fitting caused a leak in the narrow-line flux to the broad component, resulting in broader broad-line widths in the LJT spectra. Fixing the narrow-line flux ratios constrained the flux leak and yielded the Hydrogen-beta broad-line widths from LJT spectra $\sim$54\% closer to the Gemini Hydrogen-beta widths than with flexible narrow-line ratios. The availability of spectra at different resolutions presented this unique opportunity to inspect how spectral resolution affected emission-line profiles in our data and adopt a unique method to accurately measure broad-line widths. Reconsidering line-measurement methods while studying diverse AGN populations is critical for the success of future reverberation-mapping studies. Based on the technique used in this work, we offer recommendations for measuring line widths in narrow-line AGN. |

|**Abstract**| We present a new catalogue of the high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) in the Galaxy improving upon the most recent such catalogue. We include new HMXBs discovered since aforementioned publication and revise the classification for several objects previously considered HMXBs or candidates. The catalogue includes both basic information such as source names, coordinates, types, and more detailed data such as distance and X-ray luminosity estimates, binary system parameters and other characteristic properties of 169 HMXBs, together with appropriate references to the literature. Finding charts in several bands from infra-red to hard X-rays are also included for each object. The aim of this catalogue is to provide the reader a list of all currently known Galactic HMXBs with some basic information on both compact objects and non-degenerate counterpart properties (where available). We also include objects tentatively classified as HXMBs in the literature and give a brief motivation for the classifcation in each relevant case. The catalogue is compiled based on a search of known HMXBs and candidates in all commonly available databases and literature published before 31 October 2022. Relevant properties in the optical and other bands were collected for all objects either from the literature or using the data provided by large-scale surveys. In the later case, the counterparts in each individual survey were found by cross-correlating positions of identified HMXBs with relevant databases. An up-to date catalogue of Galactic HMXBs is presented to facilitate research in this area. An attempt was made to collect a larger set of relevant HMXB properties in a more uniform way compared to previously published works. |
