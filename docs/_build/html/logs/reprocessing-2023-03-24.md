|**Abstract**| We report the discovery of ancient massive merger events in the early-typegalaxies NGC 1380 and NGC 1427, members of the Fornax galaxy cluster. Bothgalaxies have been observed by the MUSE IFU instrument on the VLT, as part ofthe Fornax3D project. By fitting recently-developed population-orbitalsuperposition models to the observed surface brightness as well as stellarkinematic, age, and metallicity maps, we obtain the stellar orbits, age andmetallicity distributions of each galaxy. We then decompose each galaxy intomultiple orbital-based components, including a dynamically hot inner stellarhalo component which is identified as the relic of past massive mergers. Bycomparing to analogues from cosmological galaxy simulations, chiefly TNG50, wefind that the formation of such a hot inner stellar halo requires the mergerwith a now-destroyed massive satellite galaxy of $3.7_{-1.5}^{+2.7} \times10^{10}$ Msun (about $1/5$ of its current stellar mass) in the case of NGC 1380and of $1.5_{-0.7}^{+1.6} \times10^{10}$ Msun (about $1/4$ of its currentstellar mass) in the case of NGC 1427. Moreover, we infer that the last massivemerger in NGC 1380 happened $\sim10$ Gyr ago based on the stellar agedistribution of the re-grown dynamically cold disk, whereas the merger in NGC1427 ended $t\lesssim 8$ Gyr ago based on the stellar populations in its hotinner stellar halo. The major merger event in NGC 1380 is the first one withboth merger mass and merger time quantitatively inferred in a galaxy beyond theLocal Volume. Moreover, it is the oldest and most massive merger uncovered innearby galaxies so far.|

|**Abstract**| Stellar dynamos generate magnetic fields that are of fundamental importanceto the variability and evolution of Sun-like and low-mass stars, and for thedevelopment of their planetary systems. We report measurements ofsurface-average magnetic fields in 292 M dwarfs from a comparison withradiative transfer calculations; for 260 of them, this is the first measurementof this kind. Our data were obtained from more than 15,000 high-resolutionspectra taken during the CARMENES project. They reveal a relation betweenaverage field strength, <B>, and Rossby number, $Ro$, resembling thewell-studied rotation-activity relation. Among the slowly rotating stars, wefind that magnetic flux, $\Phi_\textrm{B}$, is proportional to rotation period,$P$, and among the rapidly rotating stars that average surface fields do notgrow significantly beyond the level set by the available kinetic energy.Furthermore, we find close relations between nonthermal coronal X-ray emission,chromospheric H$\alpha$ and Ca H&K emission, and magnetic flux. Taken together,these relations demonstrate empirically that the rotation-activity relation canbe traced back to a dependence of the magnetic dynamo on rotation. We advocatethe picture that the magnetic dynamo generates magnetic flux on the stellarsurface proportional to rotation rate with a saturation limit set by theavailable kinetic energy, and we provide relations for average field strengthsand nonthermal emission that are independent of the choice of the convectiveturnover time. We also find that Ca H&K emission saturates at average fieldstrengths of $\langle B \rangle \approx 800$ G while H$\alpha$ and X-rayemission grow further with stronger fields in the more rapidly rotating stars.This is in conflict with the coronal stripping scenario predicting that in themost rapidly rotating stars coronal plasma would be cooled to chromospherictemperatures.|

|**Abstract**| Feedback and outflows in galaxies that are associated with a quasar phase areexpected to be pivotal in quenching the most massive galaxies. However,observations targeting the molecular outflow phase, which dominates both themass and momentum and removes the immediate fuel for star formation, arelimited in high-z QSO hosts. Massive quiescent galaxies found at z ~ 4 arepredicted to have already quenched star formation by z ~ 5 and undergone theirmost intense growth at z > 6. Here, we present two ALMA detections of molecularoutflows, traced by blue-shifted absorption of the OH 119 micron doublet, froma sample of three z > 6 infrared luminous QSO hosts: J2310+1855 and P183+05. OH119 micron is also detected in emission in P183+05, and tentatively in thethird source: P036+03. Using similar assumptions as for high-z DustyStar-Forming Galaxy outflows, we find that our QSOs drive molecular outflowswith comparable mass outflow rates, and that are comparably energetic exceptfor J2310+1855's significantly lower outflow energy flux. We do not findevidence, nor require additional input from the central AGN to drive themolecular outflow in J2310+1855 but can not rule out an AGN contribution inP183+05 if a significant AGN contribution to L_FIR is assumed and/or if theoutflow covering fraction is high (> 53%), which evidence from the literaturesuggests is unlikely in these sources. Differences observed in the blue-shiftedabsorption spectral properties may instead be caused by the QSO hosts' morecompact dust continuum, limiting observations to lower altitude and morecentral regions of the outflow.|

|**Abstract**| The Gaia-ESO survey sample of massive OB stars in the Carina Nebula consistsof 234 stars. The addition of brighter sources from the Galactic O-StarSpectroscopic Survey and additional sources from the literature allows us tocreate the most complete census of massive OB stars done so far in the region.It contains a total of 316 stars, being 18 of them in the background and fourin the foreground. Of the 294 stellar systems in Car OB1, 74 are of O type, 214are of non-supergiant B type and 6 are of WR or non-O supergiant (II to Ia)spectral class. We identify 20 spectroscopic binary systems with an O-starprimary, of which 6 are reported for the first time, and another 18 with aB-star primary, of which 13 are new detections. The average observeddouble-lined binary fraction of O-type stars in the surveyed region is 0.35,which represents a lower limit. We find a good correlation between thespectroscopic n-qualifier and the projected rotational velocity of the stars.The fraction of candidate runaways among the stars with and without then-qualifier is 4.4% and 2.4%, respectively, although non resolved double-linedbinaries can be contaminating the fast rotators sample.|

|*Appeared on*| *2023-02-07*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted to AAS Journals*|
|**Abstract**| We present initial results from JWST NIRSpec integral field unit observationsof the nearby Supernova (SN) 1987A. The observations provide the firstspatially-resolved spectroscopy of the ejecta and equatorial ring (ER) over the1-5 $\mu$m range. We construct 3D emissivity maps of the [Fe I] 1.443 $\mu$mline from the inner ejecta and the He I 1.083 $\mu$m line from the reverseshock (RS), where the former probes the explosion geometry and the lattertraces the structure of the circumstellar medium. We also present a model forthe integrated spectrum of the ejecta. The [Fe I] 3D map reveals ahighly-asymmetric morphology resembling a broken dipole, dominated by two largeclumps with velocities of ~2300 km/s. We also find evidence that the Fe-richinner ejecta have started to interact with the RS in the south. The RS surfacetraced by the He I line extends from just inside the ER to higher latitudes onboth sides of the ER with a half-opening angle ~45 degrees, forming abubble-like structure above and below the ER. The spectral model for the ejectaallows us to identify the many emission lines in this wavelength region,including numerous H$_2$ lines. We find that the H$_2$ is most likely excitedby far-UV emission, while the metal lines ratios are consistent withrecombination in very low temperature ejecta.|

|**Abstract**| We present a high-resolution study of the cold molecular gas as traced byCO(1-0) in the unlensed z$\sim$3.4 submillimeter galaxy SMM J13120+4242, usingmulti-configuration observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array(JVLA). The gas reservoir, imaged on 0.39" ($\sim$3 kpc) scales, is resolvedinto two components separated by $\sim$11 kpc with a total extent of 16 $\sim$3kpc. Despite the large spatial extent of the reservoir, the observations show aCO(1-0) FWHM linewidth of only 267 $\pm$ 64 km s$^{-1}$. We derive a revisedline luminosity of L'$_\mathrm{CO(1-0)}$ = (10 $\pm$ 3) $\times$ 10$^{10}$ K kms$^{-1}$ pc$^2$ and a molecular gas mass of M$_\mathrm{gas}$ = (13 $\pm$ 3)$\times$ 10$^{10}$ ($\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$/1) M$_{\odot}$. Despite the presenceof a velocity gradient (consistent with previous resolved CO(6-5) imaging), theCO(1-0) imaging shows evidence for significant turbulent motions which arepreventing the gas from fully settling into a disk. The system likelyrepresents a merger in an advanced stage. Although the dynamical mass is highlyuncertain, we use it to place an upper limit on the CO-to-H$_2$ mass conversionfactor $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ of 1.4. We revisit the SED fitting, finding thatthis galaxy lies on the very massive end of the main sequence at z = 3.4. Basedon the low gas fraction, short gas depletion time and evidence for a centralAGN, we propose that SMM J13120 is in a rapid transitional phase between amerger-driven starburst and an unobscured quasar. The case of SMM J13120highlights the how mergers may drive important physical changes in galaxieswithout pushing them off the main sequence.|

|**Abstract**| The CARMENES radial-velocity survey is currently searching for planets in asample of 387 M dwarfs. Here we report on two Saturn-mass planets orbiting TYC2187-512-1 ($M_\star = 0.50 M_\odot$) and TZ Ari ($M_\star = 0.15 M_\odot$),respectively. We obtained supplementary photometric time series, which we usealong with spectroscopic information to determine the rotation periods of thetwo stars. In both cases, the radial velocities also show strong modulations atthe respective rotation period. We thus modeled the radial velocities as aKeplerian orbit plus a Gaussian process representing the stellar variability.TYC 2187-512-1 is found to harbor a planet with a minimum mass of 0.33 $M_{\rmJup}$ in a near-circular 692-day orbit. The companion of TZ Ari has a minimummass of 0.21 $M_{\rm Jup}$, orbital period of 771 d, and orbital eccentricityof 0.46. We provide an overview of all known giant planets in the CARMENESsample, from which we infer an occurrence rate of giant planets orbiting Mdwarfs with periods up to 2 years in the range between 2% to 6%. TZ Ari b isonly the second giant planet discovered orbiting a host with mass less than 0.3$M_\odot$. These objects occupy an extreme location in the planet mass versushost mass plane. It is difficult to explain their formation in core-accretionscenarios, so they may possibly have been formed through a disk fragmentationprocess.|

|**Abstract**| The high-magnification microlensing event KMT-2021-BLG-1077 exhibits a subtleand complex anomaly pattern in the region around the peak. We analyze thelensing light curve of the event with the aim of revealing the nature of theanomaly. We test various models in combination with several interpretations. Wefind that the anomaly cannot be explained by the usual three-body (2L1S and1L2S) models. The 2L2S model improves the fit compared to the three-bodymodels, but it still leaves noticeable residuals. On the other hand, the 3L1Sinterpretation yields a model explaining all the major anomalous features inthe lensing light curve. According to the 3L1S interpretation, the estimatedmass ratios of the lens companions to the primary are $\sim 1.56 \times10^{-3}$ and $\sim 1.75 \times 10^{-3}$, which correspond to $\sim 1.6$ and$\sim 1.8$ times the Jupiter/Sun mass ratio, respectively, and therefore thelens is a multiplanetary system containing two giant planets. With theconstraints of the event time-scale and angular Einstein radius, it is foundthat the host of the lens system is a low-mass star of mid-to-late M spectraltype with a mass of $M_{\rm h} = 0.14^{+0.19}_{-0.07}~M_\odot$, and it hoststwo gas giant planets with masses of $M_{\rm p_1}=0.22^{+0.31}_{-0.12}~M_{\rmJ}$ and $M_{\rm p_2}=0.25^{+0.35}_{-0.13}~M_{\rm J}$. The planets lie beyondthe snow line of the host with projected separations of $a_{\perp, {\rmp}_1}=1.26^{+1.41}_{-1.08}~{\rm AU}$ and $a_{\perp, {\rmp}_2}=0.93^{+1.05}_{-0.80}~{\rm AU}$. The planetary system resides in theGalactic bulge at a distance of $D_{\rm L}=8.24^{+1.02}_{-1.16}~{\rm kpc}$. Thelens of the event is the fifth confirmed multiplanetary system detected bymicrolensing following OGLE-2006-BLG-109L, OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L,OGLE-2018-BLG-1011L, and OGLE-2019-BLG-0468L.|

|**Abstract**| We present K2-2016-BLG-0005Lb, a densely sampled, planetary binarycaustic-crossing microlensing event found from a blind search of data gatheredfrom Campaign 9 of the Kepler K2 mission (K2C9). K2-2016-BLG-0005Lb is thefirst bound microlensing exoplanet discovered from space-based data. The eventhas caustic entry and exit points that are resolved in the K2C9 data, enablingthe lens--source relative proper motion to be measured. We have fitted a binarymicrolens model to the Kepler data, and to simultaneous observations frommultiple ground-based surveys. Whilst the ground-based data only sparselysample the binary caustic, they provide a clear detection of parallax thatallows us to break completely the microlensing mass--position--velocitydegeneracy and measure the planet's mass directly. We find a host mass of$0.58\pm0.04 ~{\rm M}_\odot$ and a planetary mass of $1.1\pm0.1 ~{\rm M_J}$.The system lies at a distance of $5.2\pm0.2~$kpc from Earth towards theGalactic bulge, more than twice the distance of the previous most distantplanet found by Kepler. The sky-projected separation of the planet from itshost is found to be $4.2\pm0.3~$au which, for circular orbits, deprojects to ahost separation $a = 4.4^{+1.9}_{-0.4}~$au and orbital period $P =13^{+9}_{-2}~$yr. This makes K2-2016-BLG-0005Lb a close Jupiter analogueorbiting a low-mass host star. According to current planet formation models,this system is very close to the host mass threshold below which Jupiters arenot expected to form. Upcoming space-based exoplanet microlensing surveys byNASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and, possibly, ESA's Euclid mission,will provide demanding tests of current planet formation models.|

|**Abstract**| We present high spatial resolution (0.4", 2.2kpc) observations of theCO(6-5), CO(7-6) and [CI] lines and dust continuum emission from theinterstellar medium in the host galaxy of the quasar J0305$-$3150 at $z=6.6$.These, together with archival [CII] data at comparable spatial resolution,enable studies of the spatial distribution and kinematics between the ISM indifferent phases. When comparing the radial profiles of CO, [CII] and the dustcontinuum, we find that the CO and dust continuum exhibit similar spatialdistributions, both of which are less extended than the [CII], indicating thatthe CO and dust continuum are tracing the same gas component, while the [CII]is tracing a more extended one. In addition, we derive the radial profiles ofthe [CII]/CO, [CII]/far-infrared (FIR), CO/FIR, and dust continuum $S_{98.7 \rmGHz}/S_{258.1 \rm GHz}$ ratios. We find a decreasing $S_{98.7 \rm GHz}/S_{258.1\rm GHz}$ ratio with radius, possibly indicating a decrease of dust opticaldepth with increasing radius. We also detect some of the ISM lines andcontinuum emission in the companion galaxies previously discovered in the fieldaround J0305$-$3150. Through comparing the line-to-line and line-to-FIR ratios,we find no significant differences between the quasar and its companiongalaxies.|

|**Abstract**| We characterize the Ly$\alpha$ halo and absorption systems toward PSOJ083+11, a unique $z=6.3401$ weak-line quasar, using Gemini/GNIRS,Magellan/FIRE, and VLT/MUSE data. Strong absorptions by hydrogen and severalmetal lines (e.g., CII, MgII, and OI) are discovered in the spectrum, whichindicates the presence of: (i) a proximate sub-damped Ly$\alpha$ (sub-DLA)system at $z=6.314$ and (ii) a MgII absorber at $z=2.2305$. To describe theobserved damping wing signal, we model the Ly$\alpha$ absorption with acombination of a sub-DLA with the neutral hydrogen column density of $\logN_\mathrm{HI} = 20.03 \pm 0.30$ cm$^{-2}$ and absorption from the intergalacticmedium with a neutral fraction of around 10 percent. The sub-DLA toward PSOJ083+11 has an abundance ratio of [C/O] $=-0.04 \pm 0.33$ and metallicity of[O/H] $=-2.19 \pm 0.44$, similar to those of low-redshift metal-poor DLAs.These measurements suggest that the sub-DLA might truncate PSO J083+11'sproximity zone size and complicate the quasar lifetime measurement. However,this quasar shows no sign of a Ly$\alpha$ halo in the MUSE data cube, where theestimated $1\sigma$ limit of surface brightness is $2.76 \times 10^{-18}$ ergs$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ at aperture size of 1 arcsecond, or equivalentto a Ly$\alpha$ luminosity of $\leq 43.46$ erg s$^{-1}$. This non-detection,while being only weak independent evidence on its own, is at least consistentwith a young quasar scenario, as expected for a quasar with a short accretiontimescale.|

|**Abstract**| The elemental abundances in the broad-line regions of high-redshift quasarstrace the chemical evolution in the nuclear regions of massive galaxies in theearly universe. In this work, we study metallicity-sensitive broademission-line flux ratios in rest-frame UV spectra of 25 high-redshift (5.8 < z< 7.5) quasars observed with the VLT/X-shooter and Gemini/GNIRS instruments,ranging over $\log(M_{\rm{BH}}/M_{\odot})= 8.4-9.8$ in black hole mass and$\log(L_{\rm{bol}}/\rm{erg\, s}^{-1})= 46.7-47.7$ in bolometric luminosity. Wefit individual spectra and composites generated by binning across quasarproperties: bolometric luminosity, black hole mass, and blueshift of the \civ\,line, finding no redshift evolution in the emission-line ratios by comparingour high-redshift quasars to lower-redshift (2.0 < z < 5.0) results presentedin the literature. Using Cloudy-based locally optimally-emitting cloudphotoionisation model relations between metallicity and emission-line fluxratios, we find the observable properties of the broad emission lines to beconsistent with emission from gas clouds with metallicity that are at least 2-4times solar. Our high-redshift measurements also confirm that the blueshift ofthe CIV emission line is correlated with its equivalent width, which influencesline ratios normalised against CIV. When accounting for the CIV blueshift, wefind that the rest-frame UV emission-line flux ratios do not correlateappreciably with the black hole mass or bolometric luminosity.|

|**Abstract**| Understanding how super-massive black holes form and grow in the earlyUniverse has become a major challenge since the discovery of luminous quasarsonly 700 million years after the Big Bang. Simulations indicate an evolutionarysequence of dust-reddened quasars emerging from heavily dust-obscuredstarbursts that then transition to unobscured luminous quasars by expelling gasand dust. Although the last phase has been identified out to a redshift of 7.6,a transitioning quasar has not been found at similar redshifts owing to theirfaintness at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Here we report observationsof an ultraviolet compact object, GNz7q, associated with a dust-enshroudedstarburst at a redshift of z=7.1899+/-0.0005. The host galaxy is more luminousin dust emission than any other known object at this epoch, forming 1,600 solarmasses of stars per year within a central radius of 480 parsec. A red pointsource in the far-ultraviolet is identified in deep, high-resolution imagingand slitless spectroscopy. GNz7q is extremely faint in X-rays, which indicatesthe emergence of a uniquely ultraviolet compact star-forming region or aCompton-thick super-Eddington black-hole accretion disk at the dusty starburstcore. In the latter case, the observed properties are consistent withpredictions from cosmological simulations and suggest that GNz7q is anantecedent to unobscured luminous quasars at later epochs.|

|**Abstract**| We aim to prepare the machine-learning ground for the next generation ofspectroscopic surveys, such as 4MOST and WEAVE. Our goal is to show thatconvolutional neural networks can predict accurate stellar labels from relevantspectral features in a physically meaningful way. We built a neural network andtrained it on GIRAFFE spectra with associated stellar labels from the sixthinternal Gaia-ESO data release. Our neural network predicts the atmosphericparameters Teff and log(g) as well as the chemical abundances [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe],and [Fe/H] for 30115 stellar spectra. The scatter of predictions from eightslightly different network models shows a high internal precision of thenetwork results: 24 K for Teff, 0.03 for log(g), 0.02 dex for [Mg/Fe], 0.03 dexfor [Al/Fe], and 0.02 dex for [Fe/H]. The network gradients reveal that thenetwork is inferring the labels in a physically meaningful way from spectralfeatures. Validation with benchmark stars and several scientific applicationsconfirm that our network predictions are accurate for individual stars andrecover the properties of different stellar populations in the Milky Waygalaxy. Such a study provides very good insights into the application ofmachine-learning for the spectral analysis of large-scale spectroscopicsurveys, such as WEAVE and 4MIDABLE-LR and -HR (4MOST Milky Way disk and bulgelow- and high-resolution). The community will have to put a substantial effortinto building proactive training sets for machine-learning methods to minimizethe possible systematics.|

|**Abstract**| Interpreting and modelling astronomical catalogues requires an understandingof the catalogues' completeness or selection function: objects of whatproperties had a chance to end up in the catalogue. Here we set out toempirically quantify the completeness of the overall Gaia DR3 catalogue. Thistask is not straightforward because Gaia is the all-sky optical survey with thehighest angular resolution to date and no consistent ``ground truth'' exists toallow direct comparisons.However, well-characterised deeper imaging enables an empirical assessment ofGaia's $G$-band completeness across parts of the sky.On this basis, we devised a simple analytical completeness model of Gaia as afunction of the observed $G$ magnitude and position over the sky, whichaccounts for both the effects of crowding and the complex Gaia scanning law.Our model only depends on a single quantity: the median magnitude $M_{10}$ in apatch of the sky of catalogued sources with$\texttt{astrometric_matched_transits}$ $\leq 10$. $M_{10}$ reflects elementarycompleteness decisions in the Gaia pipeline and is computable from the Gaia DR3catalogue itself and therefore applicable across the whole sky. We calibrateour model using the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey (DECaPS) and test itspredictions against Hubble Space Telescope observations of globular clusters.We find that our model predicts Gaia's completeness values to a few per centacross the sky. We make the model available as a part of the $\texttt{gaiasf}$Python package built and maintained by the GaiaUnlimited project:$\texttt{this https URL}$|

|**Abstract**| In preparation for the release of the astrometric orbits of Gaia, Shahaf etal. (2019) proposed a triage technique to identify astrometric binaries withcompact companions based on their astrometric semi-major axis, parallax, andprimary mass. The technique requires the knowledge of the appropriatemass-luminosity relation to rule out single or close-binary main-sequencecompanions. The recent publication of the Gaia DR3 astrometric orbits used aschematic version of this approach, identifying 735 astrometric binaries thatmight have compact companions. In this communication, we return to the triageof the DR3 astrometric binaries with more careful analysis, estimating theprobability for its astrometric secondary to be a compact object or amain-sequence close binary. We compile a sample of 177 systems withhighly-probable non-luminous massive companions, which is smaller but cleanerthan the sample reported in Gaia DR3. The new sample includes 8 candidates tobe black-hole systems with compact-object masses larger than 2.4 $M_\odot$. Theorbital-eccentricity$-$secondary-mass diagram of the other 169 systems suggestsa tentative separation between the white-dwarf and the neutron-star binaries.Most white-dwarf binaries are characterized by small eccentricities of about0.1 and masses of 0.6 $M_\odot$, while the neutron star binaries displaytypical eccentricities of 0.4 and masses of 1.3 $M_\odot$.|

|**Abstract**| We introduce our Radial Velocity Survey for Planets around Young stars(RVSPY), characterise our target stars, and search for substellar companions atorbital separations smaller than a few au from the host star. We use the FEROSspectrograph to obtain high signal-to-noise spectra and time series of preciseradial velocities (RVs) of 111 stars most of which are surrounded by debrisdiscs. Our target stars have spectral types between early F and late K, amedian age of 400 Myr, and a median distance of 45 pc. We determine for alltarget stars their basic stellar parameters and present the results of thehigh-cadence RV survey and activity characterization. We achieve a mediansingle-measurement RV precision of 6 m/s and derive the short-term intrinsic RVscatter of our targets (median 22 m/s), which is mostly caused by stellaractivity and decays with age from >100 m/s at <20 Myr to <20 m/s at >500 Myr.We discover six previously unknown close companions with orbital periodsbetween 10 and 100 days, three of which are low-mass stars, and three are inthe brown dwarf mass regime. We detect no hot companion with an orbital period<10 days down to a median mass limit of ~1 M_Jup for stars younger than 500Myr, which is still compatible with the established occurrence rate of suchcompanions around main-sequence stars. We find significant RV periodicitiesbetween 1.3 and 4.5 days for 14 stars, which are, however, all caused byrotational modulation due to starspots. We also analyse the TESS photometrictime series data and find significant periodicities for most of the stars. For11 stars, the photometric periods are also clearly detected in the RV data. Wealso derive stellar rotation periods ranging from 1 to 10 days for 91 stars,mostly from TESS data. From the intrinsic activity-related short-term RVjitter, we derive the expected mass-detection thresholds for longer-periodcompanions.|

|**Abstract**| SPHERE+ is a proposed upgrade of the SPHERE instrument at the VLT, which isintended to boost the current performances of detection and characterizationfor exoplanets and disks. SPHERE+ will also serve as a demonstrator for thefuture planet finder (PCS) of the European ELT. The main science drivers forSPHERE+ are 1/ to access the bulk of the young giant planet population down tothe snow line ($3-10$ au), to bridge the gap with complementary techniques(radial velocity, astrometry); 2/ to observe fainter and redder targets in theyoungest ($1-10$\,Myr) associations compared to those observed with SPHERE todirectly study the formation of giant planets in their birth environment; 3/ toimprove the level of characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres by increasingthe spectral resolution in order to break degeneracies in giant planetatmosphere models. Achieving these objectives requires to increase thebandwidth of the xAO system (from $\sim$1 to 3\,kHz) as well as the sensitivityin the infrared (2 to 3\,mag). These features will be brought by a second stageAO system optimized in the infrared with a pyramid wavefront sensor. As a newscience instrument, a medium resolution integral field spectrograph willprovide a spectral resolution from 1000 to 5000 in the J and H bands. Thispaper gives an overview of the science drivers, requirements and keyinstrumental trade-off that were done for SPHERE+ to reach the final selectedbaseline concept.|

|**Abstract**| In the hierarchical view of star formation, giant molecular gas clouds (GMCs)undergo fragmentation to form small-scale structures made up of stars and starclusters. Here we study the connection between young star clusters and cold gasacross a range of extragalactic environments by combining the high resolution(1") PHANGS-ALMA catalogue of GMCs with the star cluster catalogues fromPHANGS-HST. The star clusters are spatially matched with the GMCs across asample of 11 nearby star-forming galaxies with a range of galactic environments(centres, bars, spiral arms, etc.). We find that after 4-6 Myr the starclusters are no longer associated with any gas clouds. Additionally, we measurethe autocorrelation of the star clusters and GMCs as well as theircross-correlation to quantify the fractal nature of hierarchical starformation. Young ($\leq$ 10 Myr) star clusters are more strongly autocorrelatedon kpc and smaller spatial scales than the >10 Myr stellar populations,indicating that the hierarchical structure dissolves over time.|

|**Abstract**| The gas surface density profile of protoplanetary disks is one of the mostfundamental physical properties to understand planet formation. However, it ischallenging to determine the surface density profile observationally, becausethe H$_2$ emission cannot be observed in low-temperature regions. We analyzedthe Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) archival data of the\co line toward the protoplanetary disk around TW Hya and discovered extremelybroad line wings due to the pressure broadening. In conjunction with apreviously reported optically thin CO isotopologue line, the pressure broadenedline wings enabled us to directly determine the midplane gas density for thefirst time. The gas surface density at $\sim5$ au from the central star reaches$\sim 10^3\ {\rm g\ cm^{-2}}$, which suggests that the inner region of the diskhas enough mass to form a Jupiter-mass planet. Additionally, the gas surfacedensity drops at the inner cavity by $\sim2$ orders of magnitude compared tooutside the cavity. We also found a low CO abundance of $\sim 10^{-6}$ withrespect to H$_2$, even inside the CO snowline, which suggests conversion of COto less volatile species. Combining our results with previous studies, the gassurface density jumps at $r\sim 20$ au, suggesting that the inner region($3<r<20$ au) might be the magnetorotational instability dead zone. This studysheds light on direct gas-surface-density constraint without assuming theCO/H$_2$ ratio using ALMA.|

|**Abstract**| Light curves of young star systems show photometric variability due todifferent kinematic, and physical processes. One of the main contributors tothe photometric variability is the changing mass accretion rate, whichregulates the interplay between the forming young star and the protoplanetarydisk. We collected high-resolution spectroscopy in eight different epochs, aswell as ground-based and space-borne multi-epoch optical and infraredphotometry of WX Cha, an M0 binary system, with an almost edge-on disk (i =87degrees) in the Chamaeleon I star-forming region. Spectroscopic observationscover 72 days, the ground-based optical monitoring covers 42 days whilespace-borne TESS photometry extends for 56 days. The multi-wavelength lightcurves exhibit quasi-periodic variability of 0.35 - 0.53 mag in thenear-infrared, and of 1.3 mag in g band. We studied the variability of selectedemission lines that trace the accretion, computed the accretion luminosity andthe mass accretion rate using empirical relations and obtained values of theaccretion luminosity between 1.6 and 3.2 Lsun and mass accretion rate between3.31x10{-7} Msun/yr and 7.76x10^{-7} Msun/yr. Our results show that WX Cha isaccreting at a rate larger than what is typical for T Tauri stars in the samestar-forming region with the same stellar parameters. We theorize that this isdue to the higher disk mass of WX Cha than what is usual for stars with similarstellar mass, and to the binary nature of the system. Daily changes in theaccretion luminosity and in the extinction can explain the photometricvariability.|

|**Abstract**| With the upgrade from GRAVITY to GRAVITY$^+$ the instrument will evolve intoan all-sky interferometer that can observe faint targets, such as high redshiftAGN. Observing the faintest targets requires reducing the noise sources inGRAVITY as much as possible. The dominant noise source, especially in the bluepart of the spectrum, is the backscattering of the metrology laser light ontothe detector. To reduce this noise we introduce two new metrology modes. With acombination of small hardware changes and software adaptations, we can dim themetrology laser during the observation without losing the phase referencing.For single beam targets, we can even turn off the metrology laser for themaximum SNR on the detector. These changes lead to an SNR improvement of over afactor of two averaged over the whole spectrum and up to a factor of eight inthe part of the spectrum currently dominated by laser noise.|

|**Abstract**| Context: A challenge with radial-velocity (RV) data is disentangling theorigin of signals either due to a planetary companion or to stellar activity.In fact, the existence of a planetary companion has been proposed, as well ascontested, around the relatively bright, nearby M3.0V star AD Leo at the sameperiod as the stellar rotation of 2.23d. Aims: We further investigate thenature of this signal. We introduce new CARMENES optical and near-IR RV dataand an analysis in combination with archival data taken by HIRES and HARPS,along with more recent data from HARPS-N, GIANO-B, and HPF. Also, we addressthe confusion concerning the binarity of AD Leo. Methods: We consider possiblecorrelations between the RVs and various stellar activity indicators accessiblewith CARMENES. We applied models within a Bayesian framework to determinewhether a Keplerian model, a red-noise quasi-periodic model using a Gaussianprocess, or a mixed model would explain the observed data best. We alsoexclusively focus on spectral lines potentially associated with stellaractivity. Results: The CARMENES RV data agree with the previously reportedperiodicity of 2.23d, correlate with some activity indicators, and exhibitchromaticity. However, when considering the entire RV data set, we find that amixed model composed of a stable and a variable component performs best.Moreover, when recomputing the RVs using only spectral lines insensitive toactivity, there appears to be some residual power at the period of interest. Wetherefore conclude that it is not possible to determinedly prove that there isno planet orbiting in synchronization with the stellar rotation given our data,current tools, machinery, and knowledge of how stellar activity affects RVs. Wedo rule out planets more massive than 27M_E (=0.084M_J). We also exclude anybinary companion around AD Leo with Msini > 3-6M_J on orbital periods <14yr.|

|**Abstract**| We report discovery of a bright, nearby ($G = 13.8;\,\,d = 480\,\rm pc$)Sun-like star orbiting a dark object. We identified the system as a black holecandidate via its astrometric orbital solution from the Gaia mission. Radialvelocities validated and refined the Gaia solution, and spectroscopy ruled outsignificant light contributions from another star. Joint modeling of radialvelocities and astrometry constrains the companion mass to $M_2 = 9.62\pm0.18\,M_{\odot}$. The spectroscopic orbit alone sets a minimum companion massof $M_2>5\,M_{\odot}$; if the companion were a $5\,M_{\odot}$ star, it would be$500$ times more luminous than the entire system. These constraints areinsensitive to the mass of the luminous star, which appears as aslowly-rotating G dwarf ($T_{\rm eff}=5850\,\rm K$, $\log g = 4.5$,$M=0.93\,M_{\odot}$), with near-solar metallicity ($\rm [Fe/H] = -0.2$) and anunremarkable abundance pattern. We find no plausible astrophysical scenariothat can explain the orbit and does not involve a black hole. The orbitalperiod, $P_{\rm orb}=185.6$ days, is longer than that of any known stellar-massblack hole binary. The system's modest eccentricity ($e=0.45$), highmetallicity, and thin-disk Galactic orbit suggest that it was born in the MilkyWay disk with at most a weak natal kick. How the system formed is uncertain.Common envelope evolution can only produce the system's wide orbit underextreme and likely unphysical assumptions. Formation models involving triplesor dynamical assembly in an open cluster may be more promising. This is thenearest known black hole by a factor of 3, and its discovery suggests theexistence of a sizable population of dormant black holes in binaries. FutureGaia releases will likely facilitate the discovery of dozens more.|

|**Abstract**| Over the last years, large (sub-)millimetre surveys of protoplanetary diskshave well constrained the demographics of disks, such as their millimetreluminosities, spectral indices, and disk radii. Additionally, severalhigh-resolution observations have revealed an abundance of substructures in thedisks dust continuum. The most prominent are ring like structures, likely dueto pressure bumps trapping dust particles. The origins and characteristics ofthese bumps, nevertheless, need to be further investigated. The purpose of thiswork is to study how dynamic pressure bumps affect observational properties ofprotoplanetary disks. We further aim to differentiate between the planetary-versus zonal flow-origin of pressure bumps. We perform one-dimensional gas anddust evolution simulations, setting up models with varying pressure bumpfeatures. We subsequently run radiative transfer calculations to obtainsynthetic images and the different quantities of observations. We find that theoutermost pressure bump determines the disks dust size across differentmillimetre wavelengths. Our modelled dust traps need to form early (< 0.1 Myr),fast (on viscous timescales), and must be long lived (> Myr) to obtain theobserved high millimetre luminosities and low spectral indices of disks. Whilethe planetary bump models can reproduce these observables irrespectively of theopacity prescription, the highest opacities are needed for the zonal flow bumpmodel to be in line with observations. Our findings favour the planetary- overthe zonal flow-origin of pressure bumps and support the idea that planetformation already occurs in early class 0-1 stages of circumstellar disks. Thedetermination of the disks effective size through its outermost pressure bumpalso delivers a possible answer to why disks in recent low-resolution surveysappear to have the same sizes across different millimetre wavelengths.|

|**Abstract**| Today, there exists a wide variety of algorithms dedicated to high-contrastimaging, especially for the detection and characterisation of exoplanetsignals. These algorithms are tailored to address the very high contrastbetween the exoplanet signal(s), which can be more than two orders of magnitudefainter than the bright starlight residuals in coronagraphic images. Thestarlight residuals are inhomogeneously distributed and follow varioustimescales that depend on the observing conditions and on the target starbrightness. Disentangling the exoplanet signals within the starlight residualsis therefore challenging, and new post-processing algorithms are striving toachieve more accurate astrophysical results. The Exoplanet Imaging DataChallenge is a community-wide effort to develop, compare and evaluatealgorithms using a set of benchmark high-contrast imaging datasets. After afirst phase ran in 2020 and focused on the detection capabilities of existingalgorithms, the focus of this ongoing second phase is to compare thecharacterisation capabilities of state-of-the-art techniques. Thecharacterisation of planetary companions is two-fold: the astrometry (estimatedposition with respect to the host star) and spectrophotometry (estimatedcontrast with respect to the host star, as a function of wavelength). The goalof this second phase is to offer a platform for the community to benchmarktechniques in a fair, homogeneous and robust way, and to foster collaborations.|

|**Abstract**| The CLusters in the Uv as EngineS (CLUES) survey is a Cosmic OriginsSpectrograph (COS) campaign aimed at acquiring the 1130 to 1770 Ã,restframe spectroscopy of very young (<20 Myr) and massive (>10^4 solar masses)star clusters in galaxies that are part of the Hubble treasury program LegacyExtraGalactic Uv Survey (LEGUS). In this first paper of a series, we describethe CLUES sample consisting of 20 young star clusters and report their physicalproperties as derived by both multi-wavelength photometry and far-UV (FUV)spectroscopy with Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Thanks to the synergy of thetwo different datasets we build a coherent picture of the diverse stellarpopulations found in each region (with sizes of 40 to 160 pc). We associate theFUV-brightest stellar population to the central targeted star cluster and theother modeled population to the diffuse stars that are included in the COSaperture. We observe better agreement between photometric and spectroscopicages for star clusters younger than 5 Myr. For clusters older than 5 Myr,photometry and spectroscopy measurements deviate, with the latter producingolder ages, due to the degeneracy of photometric models. FUV spectroscopyenables us to better constrain the stellar metallicities, a parameter thatoptical colors are insensitive to. Finally, the derived E(B-V) are quitesimilar, with a tendency for FUV spectroscopy to favor solutions with higherextinctions. The recovered masses are in agreement within a factor of 2 for allthe clusters.|

|**Abstract**| Ultra-hot Jupiters are highly irradiated gas giant exoplanets on close-inorbits around their host stars. We analyzed high-resolution spectra fromCARMENES, HARPS-N, and ESPaDOnS taken over eight observation nights to studythe emission spectrum of WASP-33b and draw conclusions about its atmosphere. Byapplying the cross-correlation technique, we detected the spectral signaturesof Ti I, V I, and a tentative signal of Ti II for the first time via emissionspectroscopy. These detections are an important finding because of thefundamental role of Ti- and V-bearing species in the planetary energy balance.Moreover, we assessed and confirm the presence of OH, Fe I, and Si I fromprevious studies. The spectral lines are all detected in emission, whichunambiguously proves the presence of an inverted temperature profile in theplanetary atmosphere. By performing retrievals on the emission lines of all thedetected species, we determined a relatively weak atmospheric thermal inversionextending from approximately 3400 K to 4000 K. We infer a supersolarmetallicity close to 1.5 dex in the planetary atmosphere, and find that itsemission signature undergoes significant line broadening with a Gaussian FWHMof about 4.5 km/s. Also, we find that the atmospheric temperature profileretrieved at orbital phases far from the secondary eclipse is about 300 K to700 K cooler than that measured close to the secondary eclipse, which isconsistent with different day- and nightside temperatures. Moreover, retrievalsperformed on the emission lines of the individual chemical species lead toconsistent results, which gives additional confidence to our retrieval method.Increasing the number of species included in the retrieval and expanding theset of retrieved atmospheric parameters will further advance our understandingof exoplanet atmospheres.|

The increased sky coverage is achieved by enlarging the maximumangular separation between the celestial science object (SC) and the off-axisfringe tracking (FT) star from currently 2 arcseconds (arcsec) up tounprecedented 30 arcsec, limited by the atmospheric conditions. This wassuccessfully demonstrated at the VLTI for the first time.|

|**Abstract**| The ESA Euclid mission will provide high-quality imaging for about 1.5billion galaxies. A software pipeline to automatically process and analyse sucha huge amount of data in real time is being developed by the Science GroundSegment of the Euclid Consortium; this pipeline will include a model-fittingalgorithm, which will provide photometric and morphological estimates ofparamount importance for the core science goals of the mission and for legacyscience. The Euclid Morphology Challenge is a comparative investigation of theperformance of five model-fitting software packages on simulated Euclid data,aimed at providing the baseline to identify the best suited algorithm to beimplemented in the pipeline. In this paper we describe the simulated data set,and we discuss the photometry results. A companion paper (Euclid Collaboration:BretonniÃ¨re et al. 2022) is focused on the structural and morphologicalestimates. We created mock Euclid images simulating five fields of view of 0.48deg2 each in the $I_E$ band of the VIS instrument, each with three realisationsof galaxy profiles (single and double SÃ©rsic, and 'realistic' profilesobtained with a neural network); for one of the fields in the double SÃ©rsicrealisation, we also simulated images for the three near-infrared $Y_E$, $J_E$and $H_E$ bands of the NISP-P instrument, and five Rubin/LSST opticalcomplementary bands ($u$, $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$). To analyse the results wecreated diagnostic plots and defined ad-hoc metrics. Five model-fittingsoftware packages (DeepLeGATo, Galapagos-2, Morfometryka, ProFit, andSourceXtractor++) were compared, all typically providing good results. (cut)|

|**Abstract**| Aims. With the large amount of molecular emission data from (sub)millimeterobservatories and incoming James Webb Space Telescope infrared spectroscopy,access to fast forward models of the chemical composition of protoplanetarydisks is of paramount importance.Methods. We used a thermo-chemical modeling code to generate a diversepopulation of protoplanetary disk models. We trained a K-nearest neighbors(KNN) regressor to instantly predict the chemistry of other disk models.Results. We show that it is possible to accurately reproduce chemistry usingjust a small subset of physical conditions, thanks to correlations between thelocal physical conditions in adopted protoplanetary disk models. We discuss theuncertainties and limitations of this method.Conclusions. The proposed method can be used for Bayesian fitting of the lineemission data to retrieve disk properties from observations. We present apipeline for reproducing the same approach on other disk chemical model sets.|

|**Abstract**| We present polarization and Faraday rotation for the supernova remnants(SNRs) G46.8-0.3, G43.3-0.2, G41.1-0.3, and G39.2-0.3 in L-band (1-2 GHz) radiocontinuum in The HI/OH/Recombination line (THOR) survey. We detect polarizationfrom G46.8-0.3, G43.3-0.2 and G39.2-0.3 but find upper limits at the 1% levelof Stokes I for G41.1-0.3. For G46.8-0.3 and G39.2-0.3 the fractionalpolarization varies on small scales from 1% to ~6%. G43.3-0.2 is less polarizedwith fractional polarization <~3%. We find upper limits at the 1% level for thebrighter regions in each SNR with no evidence for associated enhanced Faradaydepolarization. We observe significant variation in Faraday depth andfractional polarization on angular scales down to the resolution limit of 16".Approximately 6% of our polarization detections from G46.8-0.3 and G39.2-0.3exhibit two-component Faraday rotation and 14% of polarization detections inG43.3-0.2 are multi-component. For G39.2-0.3 we find a bimodal Faraday depthdistribution with a narrow peak and a broad peak for all polarizationdetections as well as for the subset with two-component Faraday rotation. Weidentify the narrow peak with the front side of the SNR and the broad peak withthe back side. Similarly, we interpret the observed Faraday depth distributionof G46.8-0.3 as a superposition of the distributions from the front side andthe back side. We interpret our results as evidence for a partially filledshell with small-scale magnetic field structure and internal Faraday rotation.|

|**Abstract**| Hot jupiters (P < 10 d, M > 60 $\mathrm{M}_\oplus$) are almost always foundalone around their stars, but four out of hundreds known have inner companionplanets. These rare companions allow us to constrain the hot jupiter'sformation history by ruling out high-eccentricity tidal migration. Less isknown about inner companions to hot Saturn-mass planets. We report here thediscovery of the TOI-2000 system, which features a hot Saturn-mass planet witha smaller inner companion. The mini-neptune TOI-2000 b ($2.70 \pm 0.15\,\mathrm{R}_\oplus$, $11.0 \pm 2.4 \,\mathrm{M}_\oplus$) is in a 3.10-dayorbit, and the hot saturn TOI-2000 c ($8.14^{+0.31}_{-0.30}\,\mathrm{R}_\oplus$, $81.7^{+4.7}_{-4.6} \,\mathrm{M}_\oplus$) is in a9.13-day orbit. Both planets transit their host star TOI-2000 (TIC 371188886, V= 10.98, TESS magnitude = 10.36), a metal-rich ([Fe/H] =$0.439^{+0.041}_{-0.043}$) G dwarf 174 pc away. TESS observed the two planetsin sectors 9-11 and 36-38, and we followed up with ground-based photometry,spectroscopy, and speckle imaging. Radial velocities from CHIRON, FEROS, andHARPS allowed us to confirm both planets by direct mass measurement. Inaddition, we demonstrate constraining planetary and stellar parameters withMIST stellar evolutionary tracks through Hamiltonian Monte Carlo under the PyMCframework, achieving higher sampling efficiency and shorter run time comparedto traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo. Having the brightest host star in theV band among similar systems, TOI-2000 b and c are superb candidates foratmospheric characterization by the JWST, which can potentially distinguishwhether they formed together or TOI-2000 c swept along material duringmigration to form TOI-2000 b.|

|**Abstract**| Atmospheric retrieval studies are essential to determine the sciencerequirements for future generation missions, such as the Large Interferometerfor Exoplanets (LIFE). The use of heterogeneous absorption cross-sections mightbe the cause of systematic effects in retrievals, which could bias a correctcharacterization of the atmosphere. In this contribution we quantified theimpact of differences in line list provenance, broadening coefficients, andline wing cut-offs in the retrieval of an Earth twin exoplanet orbiting aSun-like star at 10 pc from the observer, as it would be observed with LIFE. Weran four different retrievals on the same input spectrum, by varying theopacity tables that the Bayesian retrieval framework was allowed to use. Wefound that the systematics introduced by the opacity tables could bias thecorrect estimation of the atmospheric pressure at the surface level, as well asan accurate retrieval of the abundance of some species in the atmosphere (suchas CO$_2$ and N$_2$O). We argue that differences in the line wing cut-off mightbe the major source of errors. We highlight the need for more laboratory andmodeling efforts, as well as inter-model comparisons of the main radiativetransfer models and Bayesian retrieval frameworks. This is especially relevantin the context of LIFE and future generation missions, to identify issues andcritical points for the community to jointly work together to prepare for theanalysis of the upcoming observations.|

|**Abstract**| As part of the GLOSTAR survey we have used the VLA in its B-configuration toobserve the part of the Galactic plane between longitudes of 28d and 36d andlatitudes from -1d to +1d at the C-band (4--8 GHz). To reduce the contaminationof extended sources that are not well recovered by our coverage of the (u,v)-plane we discarded short baselines that are sensitive to emission on angularscales $<4"$. The resulting radio continuum images have an angular resolutionof 1.0", and sensitivity of $\sim60 \mu$Jy~beam$^{-1}$; making it the mostsensitive radio survey covering a large area of the Galactic plane with thisangular resolution. An automatic source extraction algorithm was used incombination with visual inspection to identify a total of 3325 radio sources. Atotal of 1457 radio sources are $\geq7\sigma$ and comprise our highly reliablecatalog; 72 of these are grouped as 22 fragmented sources, e.g., multiplecomponents of an extended and resolved source. To explore the nature of thecatalogued radio sources we searched for counterparts at millimeter andinfrared wavelengths. Our classification attempts resulted in 93 HII regioncandidates, 104 radio stars, 64 planetary nebulae, while most of the remainingradio sources are suggested to be extragalactic sources. We investigated thespectral indices ($\alpha$, $S_\nu\propto\nu^\alpha$) of radio sourcesclassified as HII region candidates and found that many have negative values.This may imply that these radio sources represent young stellar objects thatare members of the star clusters around the high mass stars that excite the HIIregions, but not these HII regions themselves. By comparing the peak fluxdensities from the GLOSTAR and CORNISH surveys we have identified 49 variableradio sources, most of them with an unknown nature. Additionally, we providethe list of 1866 radio sources detected within 5 to 7$\sigma$ levels.|

|**Abstract**| Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are massive star clusters found in all types ofgalaxies from dwarfs to massive galaxies. Recent studies show that whilelow-mass NSCs in dwarf galaxies ($M_\text{gal} < 10^{9} M_\odot$) formpredominantly out of the merger of globular clusters (GCs), high-mass NSCs inmassive galaxies have assembled most of their mass through central enrichedstar formation. So far, these results of a transition in the dominant NSCformation channel have been based on studies of early-type galaxies and massivelate-type galaxies. Here, we present the first spectroscopic analysis of asample of nine nucleated late-type dwarf galaxies with the aim of identifyingthe dominant NSC formation pathway. We use integral-field spectroscopy dataobtained with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument toanalyse the ages, metallicities, star formation histories, and star formationrates of the NSCs and their surroundings. Our sample includes galaxies withstellar masses $M_\text{gal} = 10^7 - 10^9 M_\odot$ and NSC masses$M_\text{NSC} = 6 \times 10^4 - 6 \times 10^{6} M_\odot$. Although all NSCspectra show emission lines, this emission is not always connected to starformation within the NSC, but rather to other regions along the line-of-sight.The NSC star formation histories reveal that metal-poor and old populationsdominate the stellar populations in five NSCs, possibly stemming from theinspiral of GCs. The NSCs of the most massive galaxies in our sample showsignificant contributions from young and enriched populations that indicateadditional mass growth through central star formation. Our results supportprevious findings of a transition in the dominant NSC formation channel withgalaxy mass, showing that the NSCs in low-mass galaxies predominantly growthrough the inspiral of GCs, while central star formation can contribute to NSCgrowth in more massive galaxies.|

|**Abstract**| In over a thousand known cataclysmic variables (CVs), where a white dwarf isaccreting from a hydrogen-rich star, only a dozen have orbital periods below 75minutes. One way to achieve these short periods requires the donor star to haveundergone substantial nuclear evolution prior to interacting with the whitedwarf, and it is expected that these objects will transition to heliumaccretion. These transitional CVs have been proposed as progenitors of heliumCVs. However, no known transitional CV is expected to reach an orbital periodshort enough to account for most of the helium CV population, leaving the roleof this evolutionary pathway unclear. Here we report observations of ZTFJ1813+4251, a 51-minute orbital period, fully eclipsing binary systemconsisting of a star with a temperature comparable to that of the Sun but adensity 100 times greater due to its helium-rich composition, accreting onto awhite dwarf. Phase-resolved spectra, multi-band light curves and the broadbandspectral energy distribution allow us to obtain precise and robust constraintson the masses, radii and temperatures of both components. Evolutionary modelingshows that ZTF J1813+4251 is destined to become a helium CV binary, reaching anorbital period under 20 minutes, rendering ZTF J1813+4251 a previously missinglink between helium CV binaries and hydrogen-rich CVs.|

|**Abstract**| Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of Galactic molecular clouds isimportant for understanding how clouds are affected by processes such asturbulence and magnetic fields and how this structure effects star formationwithin them. Great progress has been made in this field with the arrival of theGaia mission, which provides accurate distances to $\sim10^{9}$ stars.Combining these distances with extinctions inferred from optical-IR, we recoverthe three-dimensional structure of 16 Galactic molecular cloud complexes at$\sim1$pc resolution using our novel three-dimensional dust mapping algorithm\texttt{Dustribution}. Using \texttt{astrodendro} we derive a catalogue ofphysical parameters for each complex. We recover structures with aspect ratiosbetween 1 and 11, i.e.\ everything from near-spherical to very elongatedshapes. We find a large variation in cloud environments that is not apparentwhen studying them in two-dimensions. For example, the nearby California andOrion A clouds look similar on-sky, but we find California to be moresheet-like, and massive, which could explain their different star-formationrates. In Carina, our most distant complex, we observe evidence for dustsputtering, which explains its measured low dust mass. By calculating the totalmass of these individual clouds, we demonstrate that it is necessary to definecloud boundaries in three-dimensions in order to obtain an accurate mass;simply integrating the extinction overestimates masses. We find that Larson'srelationship on mass vs radius holds true whether you assume a spherical shapefor the cloud or take their true extents.|

|**Abstract**| The Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) is a large public spectroscopic survey that wascarried out using the multi-object FLAMES spectrograph at the Very LargeTelescope. The survey provides accurate radial velocities, stellar parameters,and elemental abundances for ~115,000 stars in all Milky Way components. Inthis paper we describe the method adopted in the final data release to derivelithium equivalent widths (EWs) and abundances. Lithium EWs were measured usingtwo different approaches for FGK and M-type stars, to account for the intrinsicdifferences in the spectra. For FGK stars, we fitted the lithium line usingGaussian components, while direct integration over a predefined interval wasadopted for M-type stars. Care was taken to ensure continuity between the tworegimes. Abundances were derived using a new set of homogeneous curves ofgrowth that were derived specifically for GES, and which were measured on asynthetic spectral grid consistently with the way the EWs were measured. Thederived abundances were validated by comparison with those measured by otheranalysis groups using different methods. Lithium EWs were measured for ~40,000stars, and abundances could be derived for ~38,000 of them. The vast majorityof the measures (80%) have been obtained for stars in open cluster fields. Theremaining objects are stars in globular clusters, or field stars in the MilkyWay disc, bulge, and halo. The GES dataset of homogeneous lithium abundancesdescribed here will be valuable for our understanding of several processes,from stellar evolution and internal mixing in stars at different evolutionarystages to Galactic evolution.|

|**Abstract**| In this work, we assess the combined use of Gaia photometry and astrometrywith infrared data from CatWISE in improving the identification ofextragalactic sources compared to the classification obtained using Gaia data.We evaluate different input feature configurations and prior functions, withthe aim of presenting a classification methodology integrating prior knowledgestemming from realistic class distributions in the universe. In our work, wecompare different classifiers, namely Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), XGBoostand CatBoost, and classify sources into three classes - star, quasar, andgalaxy, with the target quasar and galaxy class labels obtained from SDSS16 andthe star label from Gaia EDR3. In our approach, we adjust the posteriorprobabilities to reflect the intrinsic distribution of extragalactic sources inthe universe via a prior function. We introduce two priors, a global priorreflecting the overall rarity of quasars and galaxies, and a mixed prior thatincorporates in addition the distribution of the these sources as a function ofGalactic latitude and magnitude. Our best classification performances, in termsof completeness and purity of the galaxy and quasar classes, are achieved usingthe mixed prior for sources at high latitudes and in the magnitude range G =18.5 to 19.5. We apply our identified best-performing classifier to threeapplication datasets from Gaia DR3, and find that the global prior is moreconservative in what it considers to be a quasar or a galaxy compared to themixed prior. In particular, when applied to the pure quasar and galaxycandidates samples, we attain a purity of 97% for quasars and 99.9% forgalaxies using the global prior, and purities of 96% and 99% respectively usingthe mixed prior. We conclude our work by discussing the importance of applyingadjusted priors portraying realistic class distributions in the universe.|

|**Abstract**| The size frequency distribution of exoplanet radii between 1 and4$R_{\oplus}$ is bimodal with peaks at $\sim$1.4 $R_{\oplus}$ and $\sim$2.4$R_{\oplus}$, and a valley at $\sim$1.8$R_{\oplus}$. This radius valleyseparates two classes of planets -- usually referred to as "super-Earths" and"mini-Neptunes" -- and its origin remains debated. One model proposes thatsuper-Earths are the outcome of photo-evaporation or core-powered mass-lossstripping the primordial atmospheres of the mini-Neptunes. A contrasting modelinterprets the radius valley as a dichotomy in the bulk compositions, wheresuper-Earths are rocky planets and mini-Neptunes are water-ice rich worlds. Inthis work, we test whether the migration model is consistent with the radiusvalley and how it distinguishes these views. In the migration model, planetsmigrate towards the disk inner edge forming a chain of planets locked inresonant configurations. After the gas disk dispersal, orbital instabilities"break the chains" and promote late collisions. This model broadly matches theperiod-ratio and planet-multiplicity distributions of Kepler planets, andaccounts for resonant chains such as TRAPPIST-1, Kepler-223, and TOI-178. Here,by combining the outcome of planet formation simulations with compositionalmass-radius relationships, and assuming complete loss of primordial H-richatmospheres in late giant-impacts, we show that the migration model accountsfor the exoplanet radius valley and the intra-system uniformity("peas-in-a-pod") of Kepler planets. Our results suggest that planets withsizes of $\sim$1.4 $R_{\oplus}$ are mostly rocky, whereas those with sizes of$\sim$2.4 $R_{\oplus}$ are mostly water-ice rich worlds. Our results do notsupport an exclusively rocky composition for the cores of mini-Neptunes.|

|**Abstract**| We present a comprehensive study of 29 short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs)observed $\approx 0.8-60$ days post-burst using $Chandra$ and $XMM-Newton$. Weprovide the inferred distributions of SGRB jet opening angles and true eventrates to compare against neutron star merger rates. We perform uniform analysisand modeling of their afterglows, obtaining 10 opening angle measurements and19 lower limits. We report on two new opening angle measurements (SGRBs 050724Aand 200411A) and eight updated values, obtaining a median value of $\langle\theta_{\rm j} \rangle \approx 6.1^{\circ}$ [-3.2$^{\circ}$,+9.3$^{\circ}$](68\% confidence on the full distribution) from jet measurements alone. For theremaining events, we infer $\theta_{\rm j}\gtrsim 0.5-26^{\circ}$. We uncover apopulation of SGRBs with wider jets of $\theta_{\rm j} \gtrsim 10^{\circ}$(including two measurements of $\theta_{\rm j} \gtrsim 15^{\circ}$),representing $\sim 28\%$ of our sample. Coupled with multi-wavelength afterglowinformation, we derive a total true energy of $\langle E_{\rm true, tot}\rangle \approx 10^{49}-10^{50}$\,erg which is consistent with MHD jetlaunching mechanisms. Furthermore, we determine a range for thebeaming-corrected event rate of $\mathfrak{R}_{\rm true} \approx360-1800$Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, set by the inclusion of a population of wide jets on thelow end, and the jet measurements alone on the high end. From a comparison withthe latest merger rates, our results are consistent with the majority of SGRBsoriginating from binary neutron star mergers. However, our inferred rates arewell above the latest neutron star-black hole merger rates, consistent with atmost a small fraction of SGRBs originating from such mergers.|

|**Abstract**| We report the identification of a set of old super metal-rich dwarf starswith orbits of low eccentricity that reach a maximum height from the Galacticplane between ~0.5-1.5 kpc. We discuss their properties to understand theirorigins. We use data from the internal data release 6 of the Gaia-ESO Survey.We selected stars observed at high resolution with abundances of 21 species of18 individual elements. We apply hierarchical clustering to group the starswith similar chemical abundances within the complete chemical abundance space.According to their chemical properties, this set of super metal-rich stars canbe arranged into five subgroups. Four seem to follow a chemical enrichmentflow, where nearly all abundances increase in lockstep with Fe. The fifthsubgroup shows different chemical characteristics. All subgroups have thefollowing features: median ages of the order of 7-9 Gyr, Solar or sub-Solar[Mg/Fe] ratios, maximum height between 0.5-1.5 kpc, low eccentricities, and adetachment from the expected metallicity gradient with guiding radius. The highmetallicity of our stars is incompatible with a formation in the Solarneighbourhood. Their dynamic properties agree with theoretical expectationsthat these stars travelled from the inner Galaxy due to blurring and, mostimportantly, to churning. We suggest that most of this population's starsoriginated in the Milky Way's inner regions (inner disc and/or the bulge) andlater migrated to the Solar neighbourhood. The region from where the starsoriginated had a complex chemical enrichment history, with contributions fromsupernovae types Ia and II and possibly asymptotic giant branch stars.|

|**Abstract**| Transmission spectroscopy is a prime technique to study the chemicalcomposition and structure of exoplanetary atmospheres. Strong excess absorptionsignals have been detected in the optical Na I D1, 2 Fraunhofer lines duringtransits of hot Jupiters, which are attributed to the planetary atmospheres andallow us to constrain its structure. We study the atmosphere of WASP-7 b bymeans of high-resolution transit spectroscopy in the sodium lines. We analyzeda spectral transit time series of 89 high-resolution spectra of the hot JupiterWASP-7 b that was observed using the Ultraviolet and Visual EchelleSpectrograph (UVES). We used the telluric lines for an accurate alignment ofthe spectra and carry out a telluric correction with molecfit. Stellar magneticactivity was monitored by investigating chromospheric lines such as the Ca II Hand K and hydrogen H$\alpha$ lines. Finally, we obtained transmission spectraand light curves for various lines. The star shows no identifiable flares and,if any, marginal changes in activity during our observing run. The sodiumtransmission spectra and corresponding light curves clearly show signs of theRossiter-McLaughlin effect (RM) and the stellar center-to-limb variation (CLV)that we modeled using synthetic spectra. A statistically significant, narrowabsorption feature with a line contrast of 0.50$\pm$0.06% (at $\sim 8.3\sigma$level) and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.13$\pm$0.02 A is detectedat the location of the Na I D$_2$ line. For the Na I D$_1$ line signal, wederived a line contrast of 0.13$\pm$0.04% (at $\sim 3.2\sigma$ level), which weconsider a tentative detection. In addition, we provide upper limits forabsorption by the hydrogen Balmer lines (H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and H$\gamma$), KI $\lambda$7699 A, Ca II H and K, and infra-red triplet (IRT) lines.|

|**Abstract**| The current architecture of a given multi-planetary system is a keyfingerprint of its past formation and dynamical evolution history. Long-termfollow-up observations are key to complete their picture. In this paper wefocus on the confirmation and characterization of the components of the TOI-969planetary system, where TESS detected a Neptune-size planet candidate in a veryclose-in orbit around a late K-dwarf star. We use a set of precise radialvelocity observations from HARPS, PFS and CORALIE instruments covering morethan two years in combination with the TESS photometric light curve and otherground-based follow-up observations to confirm and characterize the componentsof this planetary system. We find that TOI-969 b is a transiting close-in($P_b\sim 1.82$ days) mini-Neptune planet ($m_b=9.1^{+1.1}_{-1.0}$M$_{\oplus}$, $R_b=2.765^{+0.088}_{-0.097}$ R$_{\oplus}$), thus placing it onthe {lower boundary} of the hot-Neptune desert ($T_{\rm eq,b}=941\pm31$ K). Theanalysis of its internal structure shows that TOI-969 b is a volatile-richplanet, suggesting it underwent an inward migration. The radial velocity modelalso favors the presence of a second massive body in the system, TOI-969 c,with a long period of $P_c=1700^{+290}_{-280}$ days and a minimum mass of$m_{c}\sin{i_c}=11.3^{+1.1}_{-0.9}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$, and with a highly-eccentricorbit of $e_c=0.628^{+0.043}_{-0.036}$. The TOI-969 planetary system is one ofthe few around K-dwarfs known to have this extended configuration going from avery close-in planet to a wide-separation gaseous giant. TOI-969 b has atransmission spectroscopy metric of 93, and it orbits a moderately bright($G=11.3$ mag) star, thus becoming an excellent target for atmospheric studies.The architecture of this planetary system can also provide valuable informationabout migration and formation of planetary systems.|

|**Abstract**| We cross-matched the 4XMM-DR10 catalog with the HyperLEDA database andobtained the new sample of galaxies that contain X-ray sources. Excludingduplicate observations and false matches, we present a total of 7759 galaxieswith X-ray sources. In the current work, we present general properties of thesample: namely the distribution in equatorial coordinates, radial velocitydistribution, morphological type, and X-ray fluxes. The sample includesmorphological classification for 5241 galaxies with X-ray emission, almost halfof which, 42\%, are elliptical (E, E-S0). Most galaxies in the sample havenuclear X-ray emission (6313 or 81\%), and the remaining 1443 (19\%) presentX-ray emission from the host galaxy. This sample can be used for future deepstudies of multi wavelengths properties of the galaxies with X-ray emission.|

|**Abstract**| The neutral hydrogen 21 cm line is an excellent tracer of the atomicinterstellar medium in the cold and the warm phases. Combined 21 cm emissionand absorption observations are very useful to study the properties of the gasover a wide range of density and temperature. In this work, we have used 21 cmabsorption spectra from recent interferometric surveys, along with thecorresponding emission spectra from earlier single dish surveys to study theproperties of the atomic gas in the Milky Way. In particular, we focus on acomparison of properties between lines of sight through the gas disk in theGalactic plane and high Galactic latitude lines of sight through more diffusegas. As expected, the analysis shows a lower average temperature for the gas inthe Galactic plane compared to that along the high latitude lines of sight. Thegas in the plane also has a higher molecular fraction, showing a sharptransition and flattening in the dust - gas correlation. On the other hand, theobserved correlation between 21 cm brightness temperature and optical depthindicates some intrinsic difference in spin temperature distribution and afraction of gas in the Galactic plane having intermediate optical depth (for0.02 < $\tau$ < 0.2) but higher spin temperature, compared to that of thediffuse gas at high latitude with the same optical depth. This may be due to asmall fraction of cold gas with slightly higher temperature and lower densitypresent on the Galactic plane.|

|**Abstract**| We present ALMA sub-kpc- to kpc-scale resolution observations of the [CII],CO(9-8), and OH$^{+}$\,($1_{1}$--$0_{1}$) lines along with their dust continuumemission toward the FIR luminous quasar SDSS J231038.88+185519.7 at $z =6.0031$. The [CII] brightness follows a flat distribution with a Sersic indexof 0.59. The CO(9-8) line and the dust continuum can be fit with an unresolvednuclear component and an extended Sersic component with a Sersic index of ~1.The dust temperature drops with distance from the center. The effective radiusof the dust continuum is smaller than that of the line emission and the dustmass surface density, but is consistent with that of the star formation ratesurface density. The OH$^{+}$\,($1_{1}$--$0_{1}$) line shows a P-Cygni profilewith an absorption, which may indicate an outflow with a neutral gas mass of$(6.2\pm1.2)\times10^{8} M_{\odot}$ along the line of sight. We employed a 3Dtilted ring model to fit the [CII] and CO(9-8) data cubes. The two lines areboth rotation dominated and trace identical disk geometries and gas motions. Wedecompose the circular rotation curve measured from the kinematic model fit tothe [CII] line into four matter components (black hole, stars, gas, and darkmatter). The quasar-starburst system is dominated by baryonic matter inside thecentral few kiloparsecs. We constrain the black hole mass to be$2.97^{+0.51}_{-0.77}\times 10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$; this is the first time that thedynamical mass of a black hole has been measured at $z\sim6$. A massive stellarcomponent (on the order of $10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$) may have already existed whenthe Universe was only ~0.93 Gyr old. The relations between the black hole massand the baryonic mass of this quasar indicate that the central supermassiveblack hole may have formed before its host galaxy. [Abridged version.

|**Abstract**| The high-speed variability of the local water vapor content in the Earthatmosphere is a significant contributor to ground-based wavefront qualitythroughout the infrared domain. Unlike dry air, water vapor is highlychromatic, especially in the mid-infrared. This means that adaptive opticscorrection in the visible or near-infrared domain does not necessarily ensure ahigh wavefront quality at longer wavelengths. Here, we use literaturemeasurements of water vapor seeing, and more recent infrared interferometricdata from the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), to evaluate thewavefront quality that will be delivered to the METIS mid-infrared camera andspectrograph for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), operating from 3 to 13{\mu}m, after single-conjugate adaptive optics correction in the near-infrared.We discuss how the additional wavefront error due to water vapor seeing isexpected to dominate the wavefront quality budget at N band (8-13 {\mu}m), andtherefore to drive the performance of mid-infrared high-contrast imaging modesat ELT scale. Then we present how the METIS team is planning to mitigate theeffect of water vapor seeing using focal-plane wavefront sensing techniques,and show with end-to-end simulations by how much the high-contrast imagingperformance can be improved.|

|**Abstract**| The James Webb Space Telescope's Near Infrared Imager and SlitlessSpectrograph (JWST-NIRISS) flies a 7-hole non-redundant mask (NRM), the firstsuch interferometer in space, operating at 3-5 \micron~wavelengths, and abright limit of $\simeq 4$ magnitudes in W2. We describe the NIRISS ApertureMasking Interferometry (AMI) mode to help potential observers understand itsunderlying principles, present some sample science cases, explain itsoperational observing strategies, indicate how AMI proposals can be developedwith data simulations, and how AMI data can be analyzed. We also present keyresults from commissioning AMI. Since the allied Kernel Phase Imaging (KPI)technique benefits from AMI operational strategies, we also cover NIRISS KPImethods and analysis techniques, including a new user-friendly KPI pipeline.The NIRISS KPI bright limit is $\simeq 8$ W2 magnitudes. AMI (and KPI) achievean inner working angle of $\sim 70$ mas that is well inside the $\sim 400$ masNIRCam inner working angle for its circular occulter coronagraphs at comparablewavelengths.|

|**Abstract**| We analyse the quenched fractions, gas content, and star formation historiesof ~1200 satellite galaxies with M* >= 5x10^6 Msun around 198 Milky Way- (MW)and Andromeda-like (M31) hosts in TNG50, the highest-resolution run of theIllustrisTNG simulations. Satellites exhibit larger quenched fractions forsmaller masses, at smaller distances to their host galaxy, and in the moremassive M31-like compared to MW-like hosts. As satellites cross their host'svirial radius, their gas content drops significantly: most satellites within300 kpc do not contain any detectable gas reservoirs at z=0, unless they aremassive like the Magellanic Clouds and M32. Nevertheless, their stellarassembly exhibits a large degree of diversity. On average, the cumulative starformation histories of satellites are more extended for brighter, more massivesatellites with a later infall, and for those in less massive hosts. Based onthese relationships, we can even infer infall periods for observed MW and M31dwarfs: e.g. 0-4 Gyr ago for the Magellanic Clouds and Leo I, 4-8 and 0-2 Gyrago for M32 and IC 10, respectively. Ram pressure stripping (in combinationwith tidal stripping) deprives TNG50 satellites of their gas reservoirs andultimately quenches their star formation activity, even though only a few percent of the present-day satellites around the 198 TNG50 MW/M31-like hostsappear as jellyfish. The typical time since quenching for currently quenchedTNG50 satellites is 6.9 (+2.5)(-3.3) Gyr ago. The TNG50 results are consistentwith the quenched fractions and stellar assembly of observed MW and M31satellites, however, satellites of the SAGA survey exhibit lower quenchedfractions than TNG50 and other, observed analogues.|

|**Abstract**| We analyze the physical properties of gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM)of 132 Milky Way (MW)-like central galaxies at $z=0$ from the cosmologicalmagneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50, part of the IllustrisTNG project. Theproperties and abundance of CGM gas across the sample are diverse, and thefractional budgets of different phases (cold, warm, and hot), as well asneutral HI mass and metal mass, vary considerably. Over our stellar mass rangeof $10^{10.5} < M_\star / \rm{M}_\odot < 10^{10.9}$, radial profiles of gasphysical properties from $0.15 < R\rm{ / R_{\rm 200c}} < 1.0$ reveal great CGMstructural complexity, with significant variations both at fixed distancearound individual galaxies, and across different galaxies. CGM gas ismulti-phase: the distributions of density, temperature and entropy are allmultimodal, while metallicity and thermal pressure distributions are unimodal;all are broad. We present predictions for magnetic fields in MW-like halos: amedian field strength of $|B|\sim\,1\mu$G in the inner halo decreases rapidlyat larger distance, while magnetic pressure dominates over thermal pressureonly within $\sim0.2 \times \rm{R_{200c}}$. Virial temperature gas at $\sim10^6\,$K coexists with a sub-dominant cool, $< 10^5\,$K component inapproximate pressure equilibrium. Finally, the physical properties of the CGMare tightly connected to the galactic star formation rate, in turn dependent onfeedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In TNG50, we find that energyfrom SMBH-driven kinetic winds generates high-velocity outflows ($\gtrsim500-2000$ km/s), heats gas to super-virial temperatures ($> 10^{6.5-7}$ K), andregulates the net balance of inflows versus outflows in otherwise quasi-staticgaseous halos.|

|**Abstract**| We analyze the merger and assembly histories of Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda(M31)-like galaxies to quantify how, and how often, disk galaxies of this masscan survive recent major mergers (stellar mass ratio $\ge$ 1:4). For this, weuse the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 and identify 198analog galaxies, selected based on their $z=0$ stellar mass ($10^{10.5-11.2}{\rm M_{\odot}}$), disky stellar morphology and local environment. Firstly,major mergers are common: 85 per cent (168) of MW/M31-like galaxies in TNG50have undergone at least one major merger across their lifetime. In fact, 31galaxies (16 per cent) have undergone a recent major merger, i.e. in the last 5Gyr. The gas available during the merger suffices to either induce starburstsat pericentric passages or to sustain prolonged star formation aftercoalescence: in roughly half of the cases, the pre-existing stellar disk isdestroyed because of the merger but reforms thanks to star formation. Moreover,higher merger mass ratios are more likely to destroy the stellar disks. Incomparison to those with more ancient massive mergers, MW/M31-like galaxieswith recent major mergers have, on average, somewhat thicker stellar disks,more massive and somewhat shallower stellar haloes, larger stellar ex-situ massfractions, but similarly massive kinematically-defined bulges. All this isqualitatively consistent with the different observed properties of the Galaxyand Andromeda and with the constraints on their most recent major mergers, 8-11and ~2 Gyr ago, respectively. According to contemporary cosmologicalsimulations, a recent quiet merger history is not a pre-requisite for obtaininga relatively-thin stellar disk at $z=0$.|

|**Abstract**| We analyse the location of extremely metal-poor stars (EMPs, [Fe/H]$ < -3$)in 198 Milky Way (MW)/M31-like galaxies at $z=0$ in the TNG50 simulation. Eachsystem is divided into four kinematically-defined morphological stellarcomponents based on stellar circularity and galactocentric distance, namelybulge, cold disk, warm disk, and stellar halo, in addition to satellites (withstellar mass $\ge 5\times10^6\,M_\odot$). According to TNG50 and across allsimulated systems, the stellar halo of the main galaxy and satellites presentthe highest frequency of EMPs (largest $M_{\mathrm{EMP,comp}}$-to-$M_{\mathrm{tot, comp}}$ stellar mass ratio), and thus the highestchances of finding them. Such frequency is larger in lower-mass than high-masssatellites. Moreover, TNG50 predicts that the stellar halo of the main galaxyalways hosts and thus contributes the majority of the EMPs of the system.Namely, it has the highest mass ratio of EMPs in it to all the EMPs in thesystem (largest $M_{\mathrm{EMP, comp}}$-to-$M_\mathrm{EMP}(<300\mathrm{kpc})$). However, notably, we also find that 33 MW/M31-likegalaxies in TNG50 have cold disks that contribute more than 10 per cent to thetotal EMP mass, each with $\gtrsim 10^{6.5-7}\, M_\odot$ of EMPs in coldcircular orbits. These qualitative statements do not depend on the precisedefinition of EMP stars, i.e. on the adopted metallicity threshold. The resultsof this work provide a theoretical prediction for the location of EMP starsfrom both a spatial and kinematic perspective and across an unprecedentednumber of well-resolved MW/M31-like systems.|

|**Abstract**| The interaction between Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxiesis scarcely resolved. Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies are believed torepresent AGN at early stages of their evolution and allow to observe AGNfeeding and feedback processes at high accretion rates. We apply aspectroastrometric analysis to VLT MUSE NFM-AO observations of Mrk 1044, anearby super-Eddington accreting NLS1. This allows us to map two ionised gasoutflows traced by [O$\,$III] which have velocities of $-560\pm20\,{\rmkm\:s}^{-1}$ and $-144 \pm 5 \,{\rm km\:s}^{-1}$. Both outflows are spatiallyunresolved and located close to the galaxy nucleus ($<1\,{\rm pc}$). They havegas densities higher than $10^5\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$, which implies that the BPTdiagnostic cannot be used to constrain the underlying ionisation mechanism. Weexplore whether an expanding shell model can describe the velocity structure ofMrk 1044's unresolved multi-phase outflow. A kinematic analysis suggests thatsignificant turbulence may be present in the ISM around the nucleus, which maylead to a condensation rain, potentially explaining the efficient feeding ofMrk 1044's AGN. We identify an additional ionised gas outflowing component thatis spatially resolved. It has a velocity of $-211 \pm 22 \,{\rm km\:s}^{-1}$and a projected size of $4.6 \pm 0.6 \,{\rm pc}$. Within the innermost 0.5"(160$\,{\rm pc}$) around the nucleus we detect modest star formation hidden bythe beam-smeared emission from the outflow, which suggests that Mrk 1044's AGNphase set on recently. We estimate that the multi-phase outflow has beenlaunched $<10^4 \,{\rm yrs}$ ago. It carries enough mass and energy to impactthe host galaxy star formation on different spatial scales, highlighting thecomplexity of the AGN feeding and feedback cycle in its early stages.|

|**Abstract**| Molecular lines tracing the orbital motion of gas in a well-defined disk arevaluable tools for inferring both the properties of the disk and the star itsurrounds. Lines that arise only from a disk, and not also from the surroundingmolecular cloud core that birthed the star or from the outflow it drives, arerare. Several such emission lines have recently been discovered in one examplecase, those from NaCl and KCl salt molecules. We studied a sample of 23candidate high-mass young stellar objects (HMYSOs) in 17 high-mass star-formingregions to determine how frequently emission from these species is detected. Wepresent five new detections of water, NaCl, KCl, PN, and SiS from the innermostregions around the objects, bringing the total number of known briny diskcandidates to nine. Their kinematic structure is generally disk-like, though weare unable to determine whether they arise from a disk or outflow in thesources with new detections. We demonstrate that these species are spatiallycoincident in a few resolved cases and show that they are generally detectedtogether, suggesting a common origin or excitation mechanism. We also show thatseveral disks around HMYSOs clearly do not exhibit emission in these species.Salty disks are therefore neither particularly rare in high-mass disks, nor arethey ubiquitous.|

|**Abstract**| Aims. In this work we use the Gaia DR3 set of ultracool dwarf candidates andcomplement the Gaia spectrophotometry with additional photometry in order tocharacterise its global properties. This includes the inference of thedistances, their locus in the Gaia colour-absolute magnitude diagram and the(biased through selection) luminosity function in the faint end of the MainSequence. We study the overall changes in the Gaia RP spectra as a function ofspectral type. We study the UCDs in binary systems, attempt to identifylow-mass members of nearby young associations, star forming regions andclusters, and analyse their variability properties. Results. We detect 57young, kinematically homogeneous groups some of which are identified as wellknown star forming regions, associations and clusters of different ages. Wefind that the primary members of 880 binary systems with a UCD belong mainly tothe thin and thick disk components of the Milky Way. We identify 1109 variableUCDs using the variability tables in the Gaia archive, 728 of which belong tothe star forming regions defined by HMAC. We define two groups of variable UCDswith extreme bright or faint outliers. Conclusions. The set of sourcesidentified as UCDs in the Gaia archive contains a wealth of information thatwill require focused follow-up studies and observations. It will help toadvance our understanding of the nature of the faint end of the Main Sequenceand the stellar/substellar transition.|

|**Abstract**| Aims. We present high sensitivity and high-spectral resolution NOEMAobservations of the Class 0/I binary system SVS13A, composed of the low-massprotostars VLA4A and VLA4B with a separation of ~90 au. VLA4A is undergoing anaccretion burst that enriches the chemistry of the surrounding gas. This givesus an excellent opportunity to probe the chemical and physical conditions aswell as the accretion process. Methods. We observe the (12K-11K) lines of CH3CNand CH313CN, the DCN (3-2) line, and the C18O (2-1) line toward SVS13A usingNOEMA. Results. We find complex line profiles at disk scales which cannot beexplained by a single component or pure Keplerian motion. By adopting twovelocity components to model the complex line profiles, we find that thetemperatures and densities are significantly different between these twocomponents. This suggests that the physical conditions of the emitting gastraced via CH3CN can change dramatically within the circumbinary disk. Inaddition, combining our observations of DCN (3-2) with previous ALMAhigh-angular-resolution observations, we find that the binary system (or VLA4A)might be fed by an infalling streamer from envelope scales (~700 au). If thisis the case, this streamer contributes to the accretion of material onto thesystem with a rate of at least 1.4x10-6 Msun yr-1. Conclusions. We concludethat the CH3CN emission in SVS13A traces hot gas from a complex structure. Thiscomplexity might be affected by a streamer that is possibly infalling andfunneling material into the central region.|

|**Abstract**| We present a homogeneously-selected sample of 15779 candidate binary systemswith main sequence primary stars and orbital periods shorter than 5 days. Thetargets were selected from TESS full-frame image lightcurves on the basis oftheir tidally-induced ellipsoidal modulation. Spectroscopic follow-up suggestsa sample purity of $83 \pm 13$ per cent. Injection-recovery tests allow us toestimate our overall completeness as $28 \pm 3$ per cent with $P_\mathrm{orb} <3$ days and to quantify our selection effects. We estimate that $39 \pm 4$ percent of our sample are contact binary systems, and we disentangle the perioddistributions of the contact and detached binaries. We derive the orbitalperiod distribution of the main sequence binary population at short orbitalperiods, finding a distribution continuous with the log-normal distributionpreviously found for solar-type stars at longer periods, but with a significantsteepening at $P_\mathrm{orb} \lesssim 3$ days, and a pile-up of contactbinaries at $P_\mathrm{orb} \approx 0.4$ days. Companions in the period range1--5 days are found to be an order of magnitude more frequent around starshotter than $\approx 6250 K$ (the Kraft break) when compared to cooler stars,suggesting that magnetic braking plays an important role in shaping thetemperature and period distributions. We detect resolved tertiary companions to$9.0 \pm 0.2$ per cent of our binaries with a median separation of 3200 AU. Thefrequency of tertiary companions rises to $29 \pm 5$ per cent among the systemswith the shortest ellipsoidal periods. This large binary sample with quantifiedselection effects will be a powerful resource for future studies of detachedand contact binary systems with $P_\mathrm{orb} < 5$ days.|

|*Appeared on*| *2022-11-14*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted to MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**| We explore three sets of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations,IllustrisTNG, EAGLE, and SIMBA, to investigate the physical processes impactingthe distribution of baryons in and around haloes across an unprecedented massrange of $10^8<M_{\rm 200c}/{\rm M_{\odot}}<10^{15}$, from the halo centre outto scales as large as $30\,R_{\rm 200c}$. We demonstrate that baryonic feedbackmechanisms significantly redistribute gas, lowering the baryon fractions insidehaloes while simultaneously accumulating this material outside the virialradius. To understand this large-scale baryonic redistribution and identify thedominant physical processes responsible, we examine several variants of TNGthat selectively exclude stellar and AGN feedback, cooling, and radiation. Wefind that heating from the UV background in low-mass haloes, stellar feedbackin intermediate-mass haloes, and AGN feedback in groups ($10^{12} \leq M_{\rm200c}/{\rm M_{\odot}}<10^{14}$) are the dominant processes. Galaxy clusters arethe least influenced by these processes on large scales. We introduce a newhalo mass-dependent characteristic scale, the closure radius $R_{\rm c}$,within which all baryons associated with haloes are found. For groups andclusters, we introduce a universal relation between this scale and the halobaryon fraction: $R_{\rm c}/R_{\rm 200c,500c}-1=\beta(z)(1-f_{\rm b}(<R_{\rm200c,500c})/f_{\rm b,cosmic})$, where $\beta(z)=\alpha\,(1+z)^\gamma$, and$\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are free parameters fit using the simulations.Accordingly, we predict that all baryons associated with observed X-ray haloescan be found within $R_{\rm c}\sim 1.5-2.5 R_{\rm 200c}$. Our results can beused to constrain theoretical models, particularly the physics of supernova andAGN feedback, as well as their interplay with environmental processes, throughcomparison with current and future X-ray and SZ observations.|

|**Abstract**| We present the first large-scale 3D map of interstellar dust temperature. Webuild upon existing 3D reddening maps derived from starlight absorption(Bayestar19), covering 3/4 of the sky. Starting with the column density foreach of 500 million 3D voxels, we propose a temperature and emissivitypower-law slope ($\beta$) for each of them, and integrate along the line ofsight to synthesize an emission map in five frequency bands observed by\emph{Planck} and \emph{IRAS}. The reconstructed emission map is constrained tomatch observations on a $10'$ scale, and does so with good fidelity. We produce3D temperature maps at resolutions of $110', 55', $and $27'$. We assessperformance on Cepheus, a dust cloud with two distinct components along theline of sight, and find distinct temperatures for the two components. We thusshow that this methodology has enough precision to constrain clouds withdifferent temperature along the line of sight up to $1-\sigma$ error. Thiswould be an important result for dust frequency decorrelation foregroundanalysis for cosmic microwave background experiments, which would be impactedby a line-of-sight with varying temperature and magnetic field components. Inaddition to $T$ and $\beta$, we constrain the conversion factor betweenemission optical depth and reddening. This conversion factor is assumed to beconstant in commonly used emission-based reddening maps. However, this workshows a factor of two variation that may prove significant for someapplications.|

|**Abstract**| Aiming to detect planetary companions to young stars with debris disks viathe radial velocity method, we observed HD114082 during April 2018 - August2022 as one of the targets of our RVSPY program (Radial Velocity Survey forPlanets around Young stars). We used the FEROS spectrograph, mounted to theMPG/ESO 2.2 m telescope in Chile, to obtain high signal-to-noise spectra andtime series of precise radial velocities (RVs). Additionally, we analyzedarchival HARPS spectra and TESS photometric data. We used the CERES, CERES++and SERVAL pipelines to derive RVs and activity indicators and ExoStriker forthe independent and combined analysis of the RVs and TESS photometry. We reportthe discovery of a warm super-Jovian companion around HD114082 based on a109.8$\pm$0.4 day signal in the combined RV data from FEROS and HARPS, and onone transit event in the TESS photometry. The best-fit model indicates a8.0$\pm$1.0 Mjup companion with a radius of 1.00$\pm$0.03 Rjup in an orbit witha semi-major axis of 0.51$\pm$0.01 au and an eccentricity of 0.4$\pm$0.04. Thecompanions orbit is in agreement with the known near edge-on debris disklocated at about 28 au. HD114082b is possibly the youngest (15$\pm$6 Myr), andone of only three younger than 100 Myr giant planetary companions for whichboth their mass and radius have been determined observationally. It is probablythe first properly model-constraining giant planet that allows distinguishingbetween hot and cold-start models. It is significantly more compatible with thecold-start model.|

|**Abstract**| Mapping star-formation rates (SFR) within galaxies is key to unveiling theirassembly and evolution. Calibrations exist for computing SFR from a combinationof ultraviolet and infrared bands for galaxies as integrated systems, but theirapplicability to sub-galactic (kpc) scales remains largely untested. Here weuse integral field spectroscopy of 19 nearby ($D <$ 20 Mpc) galaxies obtainedby PHANGS-MUSE to derive accurate Balmer decrements (H$\alpha$/H$\beta$) andattenuation-corrected H$\alpha$ maps. We combine this information withmid-infrared maps from WISE at 22 $\rm \mu m$, and ultraviolet maps from GALEXin the far-UV band, to derive SFR surface densities in nearby galaxies onresolved (kpc) scales. Using the H$\alpha$ attenuation-corrected SFR as areference, we find that hybrid recipes from the literature overestimate the SFRin regions of low SFR surface density, low specific star-formation rate (sSFR),low attenuation and old stellar ages. We attribute these trends to heating ofthe dust by old stellar populations (IR cirrus). We calibrate this effect byproposing functional forms for the coefficients in front of the IR term whichdepend on band ratios sensitive to the sSFR. These calibrations prove reliableas a function of physical scale. In particular, they agree within 10% with theattenuation corrections computed from the Balmer decrement on 100 pc scales.Despite small quantitative differences, our calibrations are also applicable tointegrated galaxy scales probed by the MaNGA survey, albeit with a largerscatter (up to 0.22 dex). Observations with JWST open up the possibility tocalibrate these relations in nearby galaxies with cloud-scale ($\sim$100 pc)resolution mid-IR imaging.|

|**Abstract**| We present the second data release of the MUSE Hubble UDF surveys, whichincludes the deepest spectroscopic survey ever performed. The MUSE data, withtheir 3D content, amazing depth, wide spectral range, and excellent spatial andmedium spectral resolution, are rich in information. This update of the firstrelease incorporates a new 141-hour adaptive-optics-assisted MXDF field (1'diameter FoV) in addition to the reprocessed 10-hour mosaic (3'x3') and thesingle 31-hour deep field (1'x1'). We have securely identified and measured theredshift of 2221 sources, an increase of 41% compared to the first release.With the exception of 8 stars, the collected sample consists of 25 nearbygalaxies (z < 0.25), 677 OII emitters (z=0.25-1.5), 201 galaxies in the MUSEredshift desert range (z=1.5-2.8), and 1308 LAEs (z=2.8-6.7). This representsan order of magnitude more redshifts than the collection of all spectroscopicredshifts obtained before MUSE in the Hubble UDF area (2221 vs 292). At z > 3,the difference is even more striking, with a factor of 65 increase (1308 vs20). We compared the measured redshifts against three published photometricredshift catalogs and find the photo-z accuracy to be lower than theconstraints provided by photo-z fitting codes. 80% of the galaxies have an HSTcounterpart. They are on average faint, with a median magnitude of 25.7 and28.7 for the OII and Ly-alpha emitters, respectively. SED fits show that thesegalaxies tend to be low-mass star-forming galaxies, with a median stellar massof 6.2 10**8 M and a median SFR of 0.4 M/yr. 20% of our catalog, or 424galaxies, have no HST counterpart. The vast majority of these new sources arehigh EQW z>2.8 LAEs that are detected by MUSE thanks to their bright andasymmetric broad Ly-alpha line. We release advanced data products, specificsoftware, and a web interface to select and download data sets.|

|**Abstract**| Benchmark brown dwarf companions with well-determined ages andmodel-independent masses are powerful tools to test substellar evolutionarymodels and probe the formation of giant planets and brown dwarfs. Here, wereport the independent discovery of HIP~21152~B, the first imaged brown dwarfcompanion in the Hyades, and conduct a comprehensive orbital and atmosphericcharacterization of the system. HIP~21152 was targeted in an ongoinghigh-contrast imaging campaign of stars exhibiting proper motion changesbetween Hipparcos and Gaia, and was also recently identified by Bonavita et al.(2022) and Kuzuhara et al. (2022). Our Keck/NIRC2 and SCExAO/CHARIS imaging ofHIP~21152 revealed a comoving companion at a separation of$0.37^{\prime\prime}$ (16 au). We perform a joint orbit fit of all availablerelative astrometry and radial velocities together with the Hipparcos-Gaiaproper motions, yielding a dynamical mass of $24^{+6}_{-4}\,\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$,which is $1{-}2{\sigma}$ lower than evolutionary model predictions. Hybridgrids that include the evolution of cloud properties best reproduce thedynamical mass. We also identify a comoving wide-separation($1837^{\prime\prime}$ or $7.9 \times 10^4 \, \mathrm{au}$) early-L dwarf withan inferred mass near the hydrogen-burning limit. Finally, we analyze thespectra and photometry of HIP~21152~B using the Saumon & Marley (2008)atmospheric models and a suite of retrievals. The best-fit grid-based modelshave $f_{\mathrm{sed}}=2$, indicating the presence of clouds,$T_{\mathrm{eff}}=1400 \, \mathrm{K}$, and $\log{g}=4.5 \, \mathrm{dex}$. Theseresults are consistent with the object's spectral type of $\mathrm{T0\pm1}$. Asthe first benchmark brown dwarf companion in the Hyades, HIP~21152~B joins thesmall but growing number of substellar companions with well-determined ages anddynamical masses.|

|**Abstract**| We present new optical and near-IR images of debris disk around the F-typestar HD 114082. We obtained direct imaging observations and analysed the TESSphotometric time series data of this target with a goal to search for planetarycompanions and to characterise the morphology of the debris disk and thescattering properties of dust particles. HD 114082 was observed with theVLT/SPHERE instrument: the IRDIS camera in the K band together with the IFS inthe Y, J and H band using the ADI technique as well as IRDIS in the H band andZIMPOL in the I_PRIME band using the PDI technique. The scattered light imageswere fitted with a 3D model for single scattering in an optically thin dustdisk. We performed aperture photometry in order to derive the scattering andpolarized phase functions, polarization fraction and spectral scattering albedofor the dust particles in the disk. This method was also used to obtain thereflectance spectrum of the disk to retrieve the disk color and study the dustreflectivity in comparison to the debris disk HD 117214. We also performed themodeling of the HD 114082 light curve measured by TESS using the models forplanet transit and stellar activity to put constraints on radius of thedetected planet and its orbit. The debris disk appears as an axisymmetricdebris belt with a radius of ~0.37$"$ (35 au), inclination of ~83$^\circ$ and awide inner cavity. Dust particles in HD 114082 have a maximum polarizationfraction of ~17% and a high reflectivity which results in a spectral scatteringalbedo of 0.65. The analysis of TESS photometric data reveals a transitingplanetary companion to HD 114082 with a radius of $\sim$1~$\rm R_{J}$ on anorbit with a semi-major axis of $0.7 \pm 0.4$ au. Combining different data, wereach deep sensitivity limits in terms of companion masses down to ~5$M_{\rmJup}$ at 50 au, and ~10 $M_{\rm Jup}$ at 30 au from the central star.|

|**Abstract**| Cosmic reionization was the last major phase transition of hydrogen fromneutral to highly ionized in the intergalactic medium (IGM). Currentobservations show that the IGM is significantly neutral at $z>7$, and largelyionized by $z\sim5.5$. However, most methods to measure the IGM neutralfraction are highly model-dependent, and are limited to when thevolume-averaged neutral fraction of the IGM is either relatively low($\bar{x}_{\rm HI} \lesssim 10^{-3}$) or close to unity ($\bar{x}_{\rm HI}\sim1$). In particular, the neutral fraction evolution of the IGM at the criticalredshift range of $z=6-7$ is poorly constrained. We present new constraints on$\bar{x}_{\rm HI}$ at $z\sim5.1-6.8$, by analyzing deep optical spectra of $53$quasars at $5.73<z<7.09$. We derive model-independent upper limits on theneutral hydrogen fraction based on the fraction of "dark" pixels identified inthe Lyman $\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) and Lyman $\beta$ (Ly$\beta$) forests, withoutany assumptions on the IGM model or the intrinsic shape of the quasarcontinuum. They are the first model-independent constraints on the IGM neutralhydrogen fraction at $z\sim6.2-6.8$ using quasar absorption measurements. Ourresults give upper limits of $\bar{x}_{\rm HI}(z=6.3) < 0.79\pm0.04$(1$\sigma$), $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} (z=6.5) < 0.87\pm0.03$ (1$\sigma$), and$\bar{x}_{\rm HI} (z=6.7) < 0.94^{+0.06}_{-0.09}$ (1$\sigma$). The dark pixelfractions at $z>6.1$ are consistent with the redshift evolution of the neutralfraction of the IGM derived from the Planck 2018.|

|**Abstract**| To test the current theory on galaxy formation and evolution, it is essentialto strengthening the synergy between simulations and observations. For thisreason, in our previous paper of this series, we presented a method to mockSDSS-IV/MaNGA integral-field spectroscopic galaxy observations fromcosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Here we present the resultingmock galaxy catalogue. This catalogue consists of 1,000 unique galaxies inTNG50 falling into the SDSS-IV/MaNGA-Primary target footprint, defined in theredshift and i-band absolute magnitude space, i.e. the iMaNGA sample. In thispaper, we describe the general characteristics of the catalogue, in terms ofmorphology, kinematics, and stellar population properties. We also investigateour ability to recover the galaxy characteristics, as given by the simulations,analysing the synthetic spectra. We demonstrate that the `intrinsic' andrecovered stellar kinematics, and stellar age and metallicity are consistentwith zero within the 1$-{\sigma}$ level, for all the $\sim 8$ million tasselsin the iMaNGA sample presented in this paper. We also compare `intrinsic' andrecovered star formation histories, noting a strong resemblance. Therefore, ourmocking and spectral fitting processes do not distort `intrinsic' galaxyproperties, hence we can use these results for scientific analysis. In thefuture papers of this series, we will present a comprehensive comparison andscientific analysis of TNG50 simulations with MaNGA observational results.|

|**Abstract**| The earliest stages of star formation occur enshrouded in dust and are notobservable in the optical. Here we leverage the extraordinary newhigh-resolution infrared imaging from JWST to begin the study of dust-embeddedstar clusters in nearby galaxies throughout the local volume. We present atechnique for identifying dust-embedded clusters in NGC 7496 (18.7 Mpc), thefirst galaxy to be observed by the PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1 Treasury Survey. Weselect sources that have strong 3.3$\mu$m PAH emission based on a $\rmF300M-F335M$ color excess, and identify 67 candidate embedded clusters. Onlyeight of these are found in the PHANGS-HST optically-selected cluster catalogand all are young (six have SED-fit ages of $\sim1$ Myr). We find that thissample of embedded cluster candidates may significantly increase the census ofyoung clusters in NGC 7496 from the PHANGS-HST catalog -- the number ofclusters younger than $\sim$2 Myr could be increased by a factor of two.Candidates are preferentially located in dust lanes, and are coincident withpeaks in PHANGS-ALMA CO (2-1) maps. We take a first look at concentrationindices, luminosity functions, SEDs spanning from 2700A to 21$\mu$m, andstellar masses (estimated to be between $\sim10^4-10^5 M_{\odot}$). The methodstested here provide a basis for future work to derive accurate constraints onthe physical properties of embedded clusters, characterize the completeness ofcluster samples, and expand analysis to all 19 galaxies in the PHANGS-JWSTsample, which will enable basic unsolved problems in star formation and clusterevolution to be addressed.|

|**Abstract**| Context. While over 1000 supernova remnants (SNRs) are estimated to exist inthe Milky Way, only less than 400 have been found to date. In the context ofthis apparent deficiency, more than 150 SNR candidates were recently identifiedin the D-configuration Very Large Array (VLA-D) continuum images of the 4--8GHz global view on star formation (GLOSTAR) survey, in the Galactic longituderange $-2^\circ<l<60^\circ$. Aims. We attempt to find evidence of nonthermalsynchrotron emission from 35 SNR candidates in the region of Galactic longituderange $28^\circ<l<36^\circ$, and also to study the radio continuum emissionfrom the previously confirmed SNRs in this region. Methods. Using theshort-spacing corrected GLOSTAR VLA-D+Effelsberg images, we measure ${\sim}6$GHz total and linearly polarized flux densities of the SNR candidates and theSNRs that were previously confirmed. We also attempt to determine the spectralindices by measuring flux densities from complementary Galactic plane surveysand from the temperature-temperature plots of the GLOSTAR-Effelsberg images.Results. We provide evidence of nonthermal emission from four candidates thathave spectral indices and polarization consistent with a SNR origin, and,considering their morphology, we are confident that three of these(G28.36+0.21, G28.78-0.44, and G29.38+0.10) are indeed SNRs. However, about$25\%$ of the candidates have spectral index measurements that indicate thermalemission, and the rest of them are too faint to have a good constraint on thespectral index yet. Conclusions. Additional observations at longer wavelengthsand higher sensitivities will shed more light on the nature of thesecandidates. A simple Monte-Carlo simulation reiterates the view that futurestudies must persist with the current strategy of searching for SNRs with smallangular size to solve the problem of the Milky Way's missing SNRs.|

|**Abstract**| We test a scenario in which radial migration could affect the Li abundancepattern of dwarf stars in the solar neighbourhood. This may confirm that the Liabundance in these stars can not serve as a probe for the Li abundance in theinterstellar medium. We use the high-quality data (including Li abundances)from the 6th internal Data Release of the Gaia-ESO survey. In this sample, wegroup stars by similarity in chemical abundances via hierarchical clustering.Our analysis treats both measured Li abundances and upper limits. The Lienvelope of the previously identified radially migrated stars is well below thebenchmark meteoritic value (<3.26 dex); the star with the highest detectedabundance has A(Li) = 2.76 dex. This confirms the previous trends observed forold dwarf stars (median ages $\sim$ 8 Gyr), where Li decreases for[Fe/H]$\gtrsim$0. This result acts as supporting evidence that the abundance ofLi measured in the upper envelope of old dwarf stars should not be considered aproxy for the interstellar medium Li. Our scenario also indicates that thestellar yields for [M/H]>0 should not be decreased, as recently proposed in theliterature. Our study backs the recent studies that claimed that old dwarfs onthe hot side of the dip are efficient probes of the ISM abundance of Li,provided atomic diffusion does not lower significantly the initial Li abundancein the atmospheres of metal-rich objects.|

|**Abstract**| [Full abstract in the paper] We aim to better constrain the atmosphericproperties of the directly imaged exoplanet 51~Eri~b by using a retrievalapproach on higher signal-to-noise data than previously reported. In thiscontext, we also compare the results of using the atmospheric retrieval code\texttt{petitRADTRANS} vs a self-consistent model to fit atmosphericparameters. We present a higher signal-to-noise $YH$ spectrum of the planet andrevised $K1K2$ photometry (M$_{K1} = 15.11 \pm 0.04$ mag, M$_{K2} = 17.11 \pm0.38$ mag). The best-fit parameters obtained using an atmospheric retrievaldiffer from previous results using self-consistent models. In general, we findthat our solutions tend towards cloud-free atmospheres (e.g. log $\tau_{\rmclouds} = -5.20 \pm 1.44$). For our ``nominal'' model with new data, we find alower metallicity ([Fe/H] $= 0.26\pm$0.30 dex) and C/O ratio ($0.38\pm0.09$),and a slightly higher effective temperature (T$_{\rm{eff}} = 807\pm$45 K) thanprevious studies. The surface gravity (log $g = 4.05\pm0.37$) is in agreementwith the reported values in the literature within uncertainties. We estimatethe mass of the planet to be between 2 and 4 M$_{\rm{Jup}}$. When comparingwith self-consistent models, we encounter a known correlation between thepresence of clouds and the shape of the $P-T$ profiles. Our findings supportthe idea that results from atmospheric retrievals should not be discussed inisolation, but rather along with self-consistent temperature structuresobtained using the retrieval's best-fit parameters.|

|**Abstract**| Over the last two decades, around 300 quasars have been discovered at$z\gtrsim6$, yet only one has identified as being strongly gravitationallylensed. We explore a new approach -- enlarging the permitted spectral parameterspace, while introducing a new spatial geometry veto criterion -- which isimplemented via image-based deep learning. We first apply this approach to asystematic search for reionization-era lensed quasars, using data from the DarkEnergy Survey, the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for AstronomyHemisphere Survey, and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer.Our searchmethod consists of two main parts: (i) the preselection of the candidates basedon their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using catalog-level photometryand (ii) relative probabilities calculation of the candidates being a lens orsome contaminant, utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN)classification. The training data sets are constructed by painting deflectedpoint-source lights over actual galaxy images, to generate realisticgalaxy-quasar lens models, optimized to find systems with small imageseparations, i.e., Einstein radii of $\theta_\mathrm{E} \leq 1$ arcsec. Visualinspection is then performed for sources with CNN scores of $P_\mathrm{lens} >0.1$, which leads us to obtain 36 newly selected lens candidates, which areawaiting spectroscopic confirmation. These findings show that automated SEDmodeling and deep learning pipelines, supported by modest human input, are apromising route for detecting strong lenses from large catalogs that canovercome the veto limitations of primarily dropout-based SED selectionapproaches.|

|**Abstract**| Although diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) were discovered over 100 yearsago, for most of them, their origins are still unknown. Investigation on thecorrelations between different DIBs is an important way to study the behaviorand distributions of their carriers. Based on stacking thousands of spectrafrom the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey, we study the correlations between twoDIBs at 442.8 nm ($\lambda$442.8) and 862.1 nm ($\lambda$862.1), as well as thedust grains, in a range of latitude spanning ${\sim}22^{\circ}$($4^{\circ}\,{<}\,|b|\,{<}\,15^{\circ}$) toward the Galactic center($|\ell|\,{<}\,11^{\circ}$). Tight linear intensity correlations can be foundbetween $\lambda$442.8, $\lambda$862.1, and dust grains for$|b|\,{<}\,12^{\circ}$ or $E(B-V)\,{>}\,0.3$ mag. For $|b|\,{>}\,12^{\circ}$,$\lambda$442.8 and $\lambda$862.1 present larger relative strength with respectto the dust grains. A systematic variation of the relative strength between$\lambda$442.8 and $\lambda$862.1 with $|b|$ and $E(B-V)$ concludes that thetwo DIBs do not share a common carrier. Furthermore, the carrier of$\lambda$862.1 is more abundant at high latitudes than that of $\lambda$442.8.This work can be treated as an example showing the significance and potentialsto the DIB research covering a large latitude range.|

|**Abstract**| We present the statistical analysis of a subsample of 45 young starssurrounded by protoplanetary disks (PPDs). This is the largest imaging surveyuniquely focused on PPDs to date. Our goal is to search for young formingcompanions embedded in the disk material and to constrain their occurrence ratein relation to the formation mechanism. We used principal component analysisbased point spread function subtraction techniques to reveal young companionsforming in the disks. We calculated detection limits for our datasets andadopted a black-body model to derive temperature upper limits of potentialforming planets. We then used Monte Carlo simulations to constrain thepopulation of forming gas giant companions and compare our results to differenttypes of formation scenarios. Our data revealed a new binary system (HD38120)and a recently identified triple system with a brown dwarf companion orbiting abinary system (HD101412), in addition to 12 known companions. Furthermore, wedetected signals from 17 disks, two of which (HD72106 and TCrA) were imaged forthe first time. We reached median detection limits of L =15.4 mag at 2.0arcsec, which were used to investigate the temperature of potentially embeddedforming companions. We can constrain the occurrence of forming planets withsemi-major axis a in [20 - 500] au and Teff in [600 - 3000] K, in line with thestatistical results obtained for more evolved systems from other direct imagingsurveys. The NaCo-ISPY data confirm that massive bright planets accreting athigh rates are rare. More powerful instruments with better sensitivity in thenear- to mid-infrared are likely required to unveil the wealth of formingplanets sculpting the observed disk substructures.|

|**Abstract**| TOI-270d is a temperate sub-Neptune discovered by the Transiting ExoplanetSurvey Satellite (TESS) around a bright (J=9.1mag) M3V host star. With anapproximate radius of 2RE and equilibrium temperature of 350K, TOI-270d is oneof the most promising small exoplanets for atmospheric characterisation usingtransit spectroscopy. Here we present a primary transit observation of TOI-270dmade with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3)spectrograph across the 1.126-1.644 micron wavelength range, and a 95% credibleupper limit of $8.2 \times 10^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ A$^{-1}$arcsec$^{-2}$ for the stellar Ly-alpha emission obtained using the SpaceTelescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The transmission spectrum derived fromthe TESS and WFC3 data provides evidence for molecular absorption by ahydrogen-rich atmosphere at 4-sigma significance relative to a featurelessspectrum. The strongest evidence for any individual absorber is obtained forH2O, which is favoured at 3-sigma significance. When retrieving on the WFC3data alone and allowing for the possibility of a heterogeneous stellarbrightness profile, the detection significance of H2O is reduced to 2.8-sigma.Further observations are therefore required to robustly determine theatmospheric composition of TOI-270d and assess the impact of stellarheterogeneity. If confirmed, our findings would make TOI-270d one of thesmallest and coolest exoplanets to date with detected atmospheric spectralfeatures.|

|**Abstract**| The earliest stages of star formation, when young stars are still deeplyembedded in their natal clouds, represent a critical phase in the matter cyclebetween gas clouds and young stellar regions. Until now, the high-resolutioninfrared observations required for characterizing this heavily obscured phase(during which massive stars have formed, but optical emission is not detected)could only be obtained for a handful of the most nearby galaxies. One of themain hurdles has been the limited angular resolution of the Spitzer SpaceTelescope. With the revolutionary capabilities of the JWST, it is now possibleto investigate the matter cycle during the earliest phases of star formation asa function of the galactic environment. In this Letter, we demonstrate this bymeasuring the duration of the embedded phase of star formation and the impliedtime over which molecular clouds remain inert in the galaxy NGC628 at adistance of 9.8Mpc, demonstrating that the cosmic volume where this measurementcan be made has increased by a factor of $>100$ compared to Spitzer. We showthat young massive stars remain embedded for $5.1_{-1.4}^{+2.7}$Myr($2.3_{-1.4}^{+2.7}$Myr of which being heavily obscured), representing$\sim20\%$ of the total cloud lifetime. These values are in broad agreementwith previous measurements in five nearby ($D < 3.5$Mpc) galaxies andconstitute a proof of concept for the systematic characterization of the earlyphase of star formation across the nearby galaxy population with thePHANGS-JWST survey.|

|**Abstract**| We present here the first ever mid-infrared spectroscopic time seriesobservation of the transiting exoplanet \object{L 168-9 b} with theMid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope. The data wereobtained as part of the MIRI commissioning activities, to characterize theperformance of the Low Resolution Spectroscopy (LRS) mode for these challengingobservations. To assess the MIRI LRS performance, we performed two independentanalyses of the data. We find that with a single transit observation we reacheda spectro-photometric precision of $\sim$50 ppm in the 7-8 \micron range atR=50, consistent with $\sim$25 ppm systematic noise. The derived band averagedtransit depth is 524 $\pm$ 15 ppm and 547 $\pm$ 13 ppm for the two appliedanalysis methods, respectively, recovering the known transit depth to within 1$\sigma$. The measured noise in the planet's transmission spectrum isapproximately 15-20 \% higher than random noise simulations over wavelengths$6.8 \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 11$ $\mu$m. \added{We observed an larger excessnoise at the shortest wavelengths of up to a factor of two, for which possiblecauses are discussed.} This performance was achieved with limited in-flightcalibration data, demonstrating the future potential of MIRI for thecharacterization of exoplanet atmospheres.|

We haveperformed spectral synthesis with \texttt{TurboSpectrum} on a grid of\texttt{MARCS} model atmospheres. Finally, we adopted \texttt{ExoTETHyS} toconvolve the high-resolution spectra ($R=2\times10^5$) with thestate-of-the-art response functions for all the PLATO cameras, and computed theLDCs that best approximate the convolved IPs. In addition to the PLATOproducts, we provide new LDCs and IPs for the Kepler mission, based on the samegrid of stellar atmospheric models and calculation procedures.

|**Abstract**| We combine JWST observations with ALMA CO and VLT-MUSE H$\alpha$ data toexamine off-spiral arm star formation in the face-on, grand-design spiralgalaxy NGC 628. We focus on the northern spiral arm, around a galactocentricradius of 3-4 kpc, and study two spurs. These form an interesting contrast, asone is CO-rich and one CO-poor, and they have a maximum azimuthal offset inMIRI 21$\mu$m and MUSE H$\alpha$ of around 40$^\circ$ (CO-rich) and 55$^\circ$(CO-poor) from the spiral arm. The star formation rate is higher in the regionsof the spurs near to spiral arms, but the star formation efficiency appearsrelatively constant. Given the spiral pattern speed and rotation curve of thisgalaxy and assuming material exiting the arms undergoes purely circular motion,these offsets would be reached in 100-150 Myr, significantly longer than the21$\mu$m and H$\alpha$ star formation timescales (both <10 Myr). The invarianceof the star formation efficiency in the spurs versus the spiral arms indicatesmassive star formation is not only triggered in spiral arms, and cannot simplyoccur in the arms and then drift away from the wave pattern. These early JWSTresults show that in-situ star formation likely occurs in the spurs, and thatthe observed young stars are not simply the `leftovers' of stellar birth in thespiral arms. The excellent physical resolution and sensitivity that JWST canattain in nearby galaxies will well resolve individual star-forming regions andhelp us to better understand the earliest phases of star formation.|

|**Abstract**| We present a high-resolution view of bubbles within The Phantom Galaxy (NGC628); a nearby (~10Mpc), star-forming (~2Msun/yr), face-on (i~9deg)grand-design spiral galaxy. With new data obtained as part of the PHANGS-JWSTtreasury program, we perform a detailed case-study of two regions of interest,one of which contains the largest and most prominent bubble in the galaxy (ThePhantom Void; over 1kpc in diameter), and the other being a smaller region thatmay be the precursor to such a large bubble (The Precursor Phantom Void). Whencomparing to matched resolution Halpha observations from the Hubble SpaceTelescope (HST), we see that the ionized gas is brightest in the shells of bothbubbles, and is coincident with the youngest (~1Myr) and most massive(~100,000Msun) stellar associations. We also find an older generation (~20Myr)of stellar associations is present within the bubble of The Phantom Void. Fromour kinematic analysis of the HI, H2 (CO) and HII gas across The Phantom Void,we infer a high expansion speed of around 15 to 50km/s. The large size and highexpansion speed of The Phantom Void suggest that the driving mechanism issustained stellar feedback due to multiple mechanisms, where early feedbackfirst cleared a bubble (as we observe now in The Precursor Phantom Void), andsince then SNe have been exploding within the cavity, and have accelerated theshell. Finally, comparison to simulations shows a striking resemblance to ourJWST observations, and suggests that such large-scale stellar feedback-drivenbubbles should be common within other galaxies.|

|*Comments*| *8 pages, 13 figures*|
|**Abstract**| We investigate the ionization of the diffuse interstellar medium by cosmicrays by modeling their propagation along the wandering magnetic fields using aMonte Carlo method. We study how low-energy cosmic rays propagate in turbulent,translucent molecular clouds, and how they regulate the ionization and bothlose and gain energy from the medium. As a test case, we use high spatialresolution (0.03 pc) CO maps of a well-studied high latitude translucent cloud,MBM 3, to model turbulence. The propagation problem is solved with a modifiedMonte Carlo procedure that includes trapping, energization, and ionizationlosses. In a homogeneous medium, trapping and re-energization do not produce asignificant effect. In a nonuniform medium, particles can be trapped for a longtime inside the cloud. This modifies the cosmic ray distribution due tostochastic acceleration at the highest energies (about 100 MeV). At lowerenergies, the re-energization is too weak to produce an appreciable effect. Thechange in the energy distribution does not significantly affect the ionizationlosses, so ionization changes are due to trapping effects.|

|**Abstract**| Observations of protoplanetary disks provide information on planet formationand the reasons for the diversity of planetary systems. The key tounderstanding planet formation is the study of dust evolution from small grainsto pebbles. Smaller grains are well-coupled to the gas dynamics, and theirdistribution is significantly extended above the disk midplane. Larger grainssettle much faster and are efficiently formed only in the midplane. Bycombining near-infrared polarized light and millimeter observations, it ispossible to constrain the spatial distribution of both the small and largegrains. We aim to construct detailed models of the size distribution andvertical/radial structure of the dust particles in protoplanetary disks basedon observational data. In particular, we are interested in recovering the dustdistribution in the IM Lup protoplanetary disk. We create a physical model forthe dust distribution of protoplanetary disks and simulate the radiativetransfer of the millimeter continuum and the near-infrared polarized radiation.Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, we compare the derived images to theobservations available for the IM Lup disk to constrain the best physical modelfor IM Lup and to recover the vertical grain size distribution. The millimeterand near-infrared emission tightly constrain the dust mass and grain sizedistribution of our model. We find size segregation in the dust distribution,with millimeter-sized grains in the disk midplane. These grains are efficientlyformed in the disk, possibly by sedimentation-driven coagulation, in accordwith the short settling timescales predicted by our model. This also suggests ahigh dust-to-gas ratio at smaller radii in the midplane, possibly triggeringstreaming instabilities and planetesimal formation in the inner disk.|

|**Abstract**| We report the first star formation history study of the Milky Way's nuclearstar cluster (NSC) that includes observational constraints from a large sampleof stellar metallicity measurements. These metallicity measurements wereobtained from recent surveys from Gemini and VLT of 770 late-type stars withinthe central 1.5 pc. These metallicity measurements, along with photometry andspectroscopically derived temperatures, are forward modeled with a Bayesianinference approach. Including metallicity measurements improves the overall fitquality, as the low-temperature red giants that were previously difficult toconstrain are now accounted for, and the best fit favors a two-component model.The dominant component contains 93%$\pm$3% of the mass, is metal-rich($\overline{[M/H]}\sim$0.45), and has an age of 5$^{+3}_{-2}$ Gyr, which is$\sim$3 Gyr younger than earlier studies with fixed (solar) metallicity; thisyounger age challenges co-evolutionary models in which the NSC and supermassiveblack holes formed simultaneously at early times. The minor populationcomponent has low metallicity ($\overline{[M/H]}\sim$ -1.1) and contains$\sim$7% of the stellar mass. The age of the minor component is uncertain (0.1- 5 Gyr old). Using the estimated parameters, we infer the following NSCstellar remnant population (with $\sim$18% uncertainty): 1.5$\times$10$^5$neutron stars, 2.5$\times$10$^5$ stellar mass black holes (BHs) and2.2$\times$10$^4$ BH-BH binaries. These predictions result in 2-4 times fewerneutron stars compared to earlier predictions that assume solar metallicity,introducing a possible new path to understand the so-called "missing pulsarproblem". Finally, we present updated predictions for the BH-BH merger rates(0.01-3 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$).|

|**Abstract**| We use PHANGS-JWST data to identify and classify 1271 compact 21 $\mu$msources in four nearby galaxies using MIRI F2100W data. We identify sourcesusing a dendrogram-based algorithm, and we measure the background-subtractedflux densities for JWST bands from 2 $\mu$m to 21 $\mu$m. Using the SED in JWSTas well as HST bands, plus ALMA and MUSE/VLT observations, we classify thesources by eye. Then we use this classification to define regions incolor-color space, and so establish a quantitative framework for classifyingsources. We identify 1085 sources as belonging to the ISM of the targetgalaxies with the remainder being dusty stars or background galaxies. These 21$\mu$m sources are strongly spatially associated with HII regions ($>92\%$ ofsources), while 74$\%$ of sources are coincident with a stellar associationdefined in the HST data. Using SED fitting, we find that the stellar masses ofthe 21 $\mu$m sources span a range of 10$^{2}$ to 10$^{4}~M_\odot$ withmass-weighted ages down to 2 Myr. There is a tight correlation betweenattenuation-corrected H$\alpha$ and 21 $\mu$m luminosity for$L_{\nu,\mathrm{F2100W}}>10^{19}~\mathrm{W~Hz}^{-1}$. Young embedded sourcecandidates selected at 21 $\mu$m are found below this threshold and have$M_\star < 10^{3}~M_\odot$.|

|**Abstract**| The environment of the high-redshift (z=1.408), powerful radio-loud galaxy 3C297 has several distinctive features of a galaxy cluster. Among them, acharacteristic halo of hot gas revealed by Chandra X-ray observations. Inaddition, a radio map obtained with the Very Large Array (VLA) shows a brighthotspot in the northwestern direction, created by the interaction of the AGNjet arising from 3C 297 with its environment. In the X-ray images, emissioncospatial with the northwestern radio lobe is detected, and peaks at theposition of the radio hotspot. The extended, complex X-ray emission observedwith our new Chandra data is largely unrelated to its radio structure. Despitehaving attributes of a galaxy cluster, no companion galaxies have beenidentified from 39 new spectra of neighboring targets of 3C 297 obtained withthe Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph. None of the 19 galaxies for which aredshift was determined lies at the same distance as 3C 297. The opticalspectral analysis of the new Gemini spectrum of 3C 297 reveals an isolatedType-II radio-loud AGN. We also detected line broadening in [O II](3728) with aFWHM about 1700 km/s and possible line shifts of up to 500-600 km/s. Wepostulate that the host galaxy of 3C 297 is a fossil group, in which most ofthe stellar mass has merged into a single object, leaving behind an X-ray halo.|

|**Abstract**| In the submm regime, spectral line scans and line intensity mapping (LIM) arenew promising probes for the cold gas content and star formation rate ofgalaxies across cosmic time. However, both of these two measurements sufferfrom field-to-field variance. We study the effect of field-to-field variance onthe predicted CO and [CII] power spectra from future LIM experiments such asCONCERTO, as well as on the line luminosity functions (LFs) and the cosmicmolecular gas mass density that are currently derived from spectral line scans.We combined a 117 $\rm deg^2$ dark matter lightcone from the Uchuu cosmologicalsimulation with the simulated infrared dusty extragalactic sky (SIDES)approach. We find that in order to constrain the CO LF with an uncertaintybelow 20%, we need survey sizes of at least 0.1 $\rm deg^2$. Furthermore,accounting for the field-to-field variance using only the Poisson variance canunderestimate the total variance by up to 80%. The lower the luminosity is andthe larger the survey size is, the higher the level of underestimate. At $z$<3,the impact of field-to-field variance on the cosmic molecular gas density canbe as high as 40% for the 4.6 arcmin$^2$ field, but drops below 10% for areaslarger than 0.2 deg$^2$. However, at $z>3$ the variance decreases more slowlywith survey size and for example drops below 10% for 1 deg$^2$ fields. Finally,we find that the CO and [CII] LIM power spectra can vary by up to 50% in $\rm 1deg^2$ fields. This limits the accuracy of the constraints provided by thefirst 1 deg$^2$ surveys. The level of the shot noise power is always dominatedby the sources that are just below the detection thresholds. We provide ananalytical formula to estimate the field-to-field variance of current or futureLIM experiments. The code and the full SIDES-Uchuu products (catalogs, cubes,and maps) are publicly available.|

|**Abstract**| Hub-filament systems are suggested to be birth cradles of high-mass stars andclusters, but the formation of hub-filament structure is still unclear. Usingthe survey data FUGIN $^{13}$CO (1-0), C$^{18}$O (1-0), and SEDIGISM $^{13}$CO(2-1), we investigate formation of hub-filament structure in W33 complex. W33complex consists of two colliding clouds, called W33-blue and W33-red. Wedecompose the velocity structures in W33-blue by fitting multiple velocitycomponents, and find a continuous and monotonic velocity field. Virialparameters of Dendrogram structures suggest the dominance of gravity inW33-blue. The strong positive correlation between velocity dispersion andcolumn density indicates the non-thermal motions in W33-blue may originate fromgravitationally driven collapse. These signatures suggest that the filamentarystructures in W33-blue result from the gravitational collapse of the compressedlayer. However, the large scale velocity gradient in W33-blue may mainlyoriginate from the cloud-cloud collision and feedback of active star formation,instead of the filament-rooted longitudinal inflow. From the above observedresults, we argue that the cloud-cloud collision triggers formation ofhub-filament structures in W33 complex. Meanwhile, the appearance ofmultiple-scale hub-filament structures in W33-blue is likely an imprint of thetransition from the compressed layer to a hub-filament system.|

|**Abstract**| The PHANGS collaboration has been building a reference dataset for themulti-scale, multi-phase study of star formation and the interstellar medium innearby galaxies. With the successful launch and commissioning of JWST, we cannow obtain high-resolution infrared imaging to probe the youngest stellarpopulations and dust emission on the scales of star clusters and molecularclouds ($\sim$5-50 pc). In Cycle 1, PHANGS is conducting an 8-band imagingsurvey from 2-21$\mu$m of 19 nearby spiral galaxies. CO(2-1) mapping, opticalintegral field spectroscopy, and UV-optical imaging for all 19 galaxies havebeen obtained through large programs with ALMA, VLT/MUSE, and Hubble.PHANGS-JWST enables a full inventory of star formation, accurate measurement ofthe mass and age of star clusters, identification of the youngest embeddedstellar populations, and characterization of the physical state of small dustgrains. When combined with Hubble catalogs of $\sim$10,000 star clusters, MUSEspectroscopic mapping of $\sim$20,000 HII regions, and $\sim$12,000ALMA-identified molecular clouds, it becomes possible to measure the timescalesand efficiencies of the earliest phases of star formation and feedback, buildan empirical model of the dependence of small dust grain properties on localISM conditions, and test our understanding of how dust-reprocessed starlighttraces star formation activity, all across a diversity of galacticenvironments. Here we describe the PHANGS-JWST Treasury survey, present theremarkable imaging obtained in the first few months of science operations, andprovide context for the initial results presented in the first series ofPHANGS-JWST publications.|

|**Abstract**| It is clearly established that the Sun has an 11-year cycle that is caused byits internal magnetic field. This cycle is also observed in a sample of Mdwarfs. In the framework of exoplanet detection or atmospheric characterisationof exoplanets, the activity status of the host star plays a crucial role, andinactive states are preferable for such studies. This means that it isimportant to know the activity cycles of these stars. We study systematiclong-term variability in a sample of 211 M dwarfs observed with CARMENES, thehigh-resolution optical and near-infrared spectrograph at Calar AltoObservatory. In an automatic search using time series of different activityindicators, we identified 26 stars with linear or quadratic trends or withpotentially cyclic behaviour. Additionally, we performed an independent searchin archival R$^{\prime}_{\rm HK}$ data collected from different instrumentswhose time baselines were usually much longer. These data are available for asubset of 186 of our sample stars. Our search revealed 22 cycle candidates inthe data. We found that the percentage of stars showing long-term variationsdrops dramatically to the latest M dwarfs. Moreover, we found that thepseudo-equivalent width (pEW) of the H$\alpha$ and Ca ii infrared triplet moreoften triggers automatic detections of long-term variations than the TiO index,differential line width, chromatic index, or radial velocity. This is in linewith our comparison of the median relative amplitudes of the differentindicators. For stars that trigger our automatic detection, this leads to thehighest amplitude variation in R$^{\prime}_{\rm HK}$, followed bypEW(H$\alpha$), pEW(Ca ii IRT), and the TiO index.|

|**Abstract**| Diffuse interstellar bands comprise hundreds of absorption features in theISM. Most DIBs are observed in the optical, but some are in the IR. We observed76 early-type stars at R=50,000 and S/N ratios of several hundreds usingCRIRES. We measure DIBs around 1318, 1527, 1561, 1565, 1567, 1574 and/or 1624nm. We detect a total of 6 DIB features and 17 likely stellar features assistedby a CMFGEN model. We also measured the DIBs at 1318 and 1527 nm usingX-shooter towards ten Ceph. variables with 3.2 < E(B-V) < 6.5 and 4 stars atlow values of water vapour.Correlation coeffs. of 0.73-0.96 are found comparing NIRDIB eq. width vs.E(B-V) and with r > 0.8 when comparing the NIR and optical DIBs 5705, 5780,6203, 6283 and 6269 A. The 5797 A DIB is less well correlated with the NIDIBs.The "C60+" DIB at 9632 A is not well correlated with the 1318 nm DIB. Partialcorrelation coefficients using E(B-V) as the covariate were also determined.For stars earlier than B2, the 1318 nm DIB is affected by an emission line onits blue wing, likely stellar in nature, although we cannot rule outinterstellar/circumstellar origin for example caused by by a DIB in emission.The 1318 nm DIB has a red wing and is reasonably well fitted by two gaussians.Neither the component ratios nor separation are correlated with 5780/5797 orE(B-V). EW(1318 nm) correlates with HI with EW(1318 nm)/E(B-V) decreasing withf(H2).Five pairs of stars within 1 am show similar 1318 nm DIB profiles. Variationin 1318 nm is seen in HD 145501/145502 and HD 168607/168625 pairs. CRIRES datafor 17 stars separated by 6-14 months and 2 X-shooter sightlines separated by9.9 yr were analysed. No time-variability is detected in the 5780, 5797 A, 1318nm or 1527 nm DIBs. Tentative time variation is observed in the C60+ DIBs at9577 and 9632 A towards HD 183143 although very close to the noise level withconfirmation required.|

|*Appeared on*| *2022-12-09*|

|**Abstract**| JWST is discovering star forming `candidate' galaxies with photometricredshifts $z>9$ and little attenuation. We model presumptive massive blackholes (MBHs) in such galaxies and find that their unobscured emission isfainter than the galaxy starlight in JWST filters, and difficult to be detectedvia color-color selection, and X-ray and radio observations. Only MBHsovermassive relative to expected galaxy scaling relations, accreting at highEddington rates, would be detectable. Their discovery would point to thepresence of heavy MBH seeds, but care is needed to exclude the existence oflighter seeds as only overmassive MBHs are detectable in this type of galaxies.Conversely, if no overmassive MBHs are hosted in these galaxies, either thereare no heavy seeds or they are rare. The most massive/highest redshiftcandidate galaxies can attain stellar masses in excess of 5e10 Msun by z~6 ifthey grow along the SFR-mass sequence, and can nurse a MBH growing from ~1e5Msun up to >3e7 Msun by z~6, to become hosts of some z>6 quasars. Candidategalaxies of log(M_{gal}/Msun)~8 can not grow their putative seeds fast, unlessseeds are >1e6 Msun. The number density of the JWST candidate galaxies faroutnumbers that of the highest-z quasar hosts and this allows for about only 1bright z~6-7 quasar every 1000 of these galaxies.|

|**Abstract**| JWST/MIRI imaging of the nearby galaxies IC 5332, NGC 628, NGC 1365 and NGC7496 from PHANGS reveals a richness of gas structures that in each case form aquasi-regular network of interconnected filaments, shells and voids. We examinewhether this multi-scale network of structure is consistent with thefragmentation of the gas disk through gravitational instability. We useFilFinder to detect the web of filamentary features in each galaxy anddetermine their characteristic radial and azimuthal spacings. These spacingsare then compared to estimates of the most Toomre-unstable length (a few kpc),the turbulent Jeans length (a few hundred pc) and the disk scale height (tensof pc) reconstructed using PHANGS-ALMA observations of the molecular gas as adynamical tracer. Our analysis of the four galaxies targeted in this workindicates that Jeans-scale structure is pervasive. Future work will beessential for determining how the structure observed in gas disks impacts notonly the rate and location of star formation but also how stellar feedbackinteracts positively or negatively with the surrounding multi-phase gasreservoir.|

|**Abstract**| Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) play a critical role in thereprocessing of stellar radiation and in balancing the heating and coolingprocesses in the interstellar medium (ISM), but appear to be destroyed in HIIregions. However, the mechanisms driving their destruction are still notcompletely understood. Using PHANGS-JWST and PHANGS-MUSE observations, weinvestigate how the PAH fraction changes in about 1500 HII regions across fournearby star-forming galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 1365, NGC 7496, IC 5332). We find astrong anti-correlation between the PAH fraction and the ionization parameter(the ratio between the ionizing photon flux and the hydrogen density) of HIIregions. This relation becomes steeper for more luminous HII regions. Themetallicity of HII regions has only a minor impact on these results in ourgalaxy sample. We find that the PAH fraction decreases with the H$\alpha$equivalent width - a proxy for the age of the HII regions - although this trendis much weaker than the one identified using the ionization parameter. Ourresults are consistent with a scenario where hydrogen-ionizing UV radiation isthe dominant source of PAH destruction in star-forming regions.|

|**Abstract**| Large-scale bars can fuel galaxy centers with molecular gas, often leading tothe development of dense ring-like structures where intense star formationoccurs, forming a very different environment compared to galactic disks. Wepair ~0.3" (30pc) resolution new JWST/MIRI imaging with archival ALMA CO(2-1)mapping of the central ~5kpc of the nearby barred spiral galaxy NGC1365, toinvestigate the physical mechanisms responsible for this extreme starformation. The molecular gas morphology is resolved into two well-known brightbar lanes that surround a smooth dynamically cold gas disk (R_gal ~ 475pc)reminiscent of non-star-forming disks in early type galaxies and likely fed bygas inflow triggered by stellar feedback in the lanes. The lanes host a largenumber of JWST-identified massive young star clusters. We find some evidencefor temporal star formation evolution along the ring. The complex kinematics inthe gas lanes reveal strong streaming motions and may be consistent withconvergence of gas streamlines expected there. Indeed, the extreme line-widthsare found to be the result of inter-`cloud' motion between gas peaks; ScousePydecomposition reveals multiple components with line widths of <sigma_CO,scouse>~ 19km/s and surface densities of <Sigma_H2,scouse> ~ 800M_sun/pc^2, similar tothe properties observed throughout the rest of the central molecular gasstructure. Tailored hydro-dynamical simulations exhibit many of the observedproperties and imply that the observed structures are transient and highlytime-variable. From our study of NGC1365, we conclude that it is predominantlythe high gas inflow triggered by the bar that is setting the star formation inits CMZ.|

|**Abstract**| We compare embedded young massive star clusters (YMCs) to (sub-)millimeterline observations tracing the excitation and dissociation of molecular gas inthe starburst ring of NGC 1365. This galaxy hosts one of the strongest nuclearstarbursts and richest populations of YMCs within 20 Mpc. Here we combinenear-/mid-IR PHANGS-JWST imaging with new ALMA multi-J CO (1-0, 2-1 and 4-3)and [CI](1-0) mapping, which we use to trace CO excitation via R42 =I_CO(4-3)/I_CO(2-1) and R21 = I_CO(2-1)/I_CO(1-0) and dissociation via RCICO =I_[CI](1-0)/I_CO(2-1) at 330 pc resolution. We find that the gas flowing intothe starburst ring from northeast to southwest appears strongly affected bystellar feedback, showing decreased excitation (lower R42) and increasedsignatures of dissociation (higher RCICO) in the downstream regions. There,radiative transfer modeling suggests that the molecular gas density decreasesand temperature and [CI/CO] abundance ratio increase. We compare R42 and RCICOwith local conditions across the regions and find that both correlate withnear-IR 2 um emission tracing the YMCs and with both PAH (11.3 um) and dustcontinuum (21 um) emission. In general, RCICO exhibits ~ 0.1 dex tightercorrelations than R42, suggesting CI to be a more sensitive tracer of changingphysical conditions in the NGC 1365 starburst than CO (4-3). Our results areconsistent with a scenario where gas flows into the two arm regions along thebar, becomes condensed/shocked, forms YMCs, and then these YMCs heat anddissociate the gas.|

|**Abstract**| We present new neutral atomic carbon [CI](3P1-3P0) mapping observationswithin the inner ~7 kpc and ~4 kpc of the disks of NGC3627 and NGC4321 at aspatial resolution of 190 pc and 270 pc, respectively, using the ALMA AtacamaCompact Array (ACA). We combine these with the CO(2-1) data from PHANGS-ALMA,and literature [CI] and CO data for two other starburst and/or active galacticnucleus (AGN) galaxies (NGC1808, NGC7469), to study: a) the spatialdistributions of CI and CO emission; b) the observed line ratio RCICO =I_[CI](1-0)/I_CO(2-1) as a function of various galactic properties; and c) theabundance ratio of [CI/CO]. We find excellent spatial correspondence between CIand CO emission and nearly uniform RCICO ~0.1 across the majority of thestar-forming disks of NGC3627 and NGC4321. However, RCICO strongly varies from~0.05 at the centre of NGC4321 to >0.2-0.5 in NGC1808's starburst centre andNGC7469's centre with an X-ray AGN. Meanwhile, RCICO does not obviously varywith $U$, similar to the prediction of PDR models. We also find a mildlydecreasing RCICO with an increasing metallicity over 0.7-0.85 solarmetallicity, consistent with the literature. Assuming various typical ISMconditions representing GMCs, active star-forming regions and strongstarbursting environments, we calculate the LTE radiative transfer and estimatethe [CI/CO] abundance ratio to be ~0.1 across the disks of NGC3627 and NGC4321,similar to previous large-scale findings in Galactic studies. However, thisabundance ratio likely has a substantial increase to ~1 and >1-5 in NGC1808'sstarburst and NGC7469's strong AGN environments, respectively, in line with theexpectations for cosmic-ray dominated region (CRDR) and X-ray dominated region(XDR) chemistry. Finally, we do not find a robust evidence for a generallyCO-dark, CI-bright gas in the disk areas we probed. (abbreviated)|

|**Abstract**| We measure the molecular gas environment near recent ($< 100$ yr old)supernovae (SNe) using $\sim1''$ or $\leq 150$pc resolution CO (2-1) maps fromthe PHANGS-ALMA survey of nearby star-forming galaxies. This is arguably thefirst such study to approach the scales of individual massive molecular clouds($M_{\rm mol} \gtrsim 10^{5.3}$ M$_{\odot}$). Using the Open Supernova Catalog(OSC), we identify 63 SNe within the PHANGS-ALMA footprint. We detect CO (2-1)emission near $\sim60\%$ of the sample at 150pc resolution, compared to$\sim35\%$ of map pixels with CO (2-1) emission, and up to $\sim95\%$ of theSNe at 1kpc resolution compared to $\sim80\%$ of map pixels with CO (2-1)emission. We expect the $\sim60\%$ of SNe within the same 150pc beam as a GMCwill likely interact with these clouds in the future, consistent with theobservation of widespread SN-molecular gas interaction in the Milky Way, whilethe other $\sim40\%$ of SNe without strong CO (2-1) detections will deposittheir energy in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM), perhaps helping drivelarge-scale turbulence or galactic outflows. Broken down by type, we detect CO(2-1) emission at the sites of $\sim85\%$ of our 9 stripped-envelope SNe(SESNe), $\sim40\%$ of our 34 Type II SNe, and $\sim35\%$ of our 13 Type IaSNe, indicating that SESNe are most closely associated with the brightest CO(2-1) emitting regions in our sample. Our results confirm that SN explosionsare not restricted to only the densest gas, and instead exert feedback across awide range of molecular gas densities.|

|**Abstract**| Ratios of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) vibrational bands are apromising tool for measuring the properties of the PAH population and theireffect on star formation. The photometric bands of the MIRI and NIRCaminstruments on JWST provide the opportunity to measure PAH emission featuresacross entire galaxy disks at unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. Here wepresent the first results of this analysis in a sample of three nearbygalaxies: NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496. Based on the variations observed inthe 3.3, 7.7, and 11.3 $\mu$m features, we infer changes to the average PAHsize and ionization state across the different galaxy environments. High valuesof F335M$_{\rm PAH}$/F1130W and low values of F1130W/F770W are measured in H IIregions in all three galaxies. This suggests that these regions are populatedby hotter PAHs, and/or that the PAH ionization fraction is larger. We seeadditional evidence of heating and/or changes in PAH size in regions withhigher molecular gas content as well as increased ionization in regions withhigher H$\alpha$ intensity.|

Revision in progress*|
|**Abstract**| We develop a method to identify and determine the physical properties ofstellar associations using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) NUV-U-B-V-I imaging ofnearby galaxies from the PHANGS-HST survey. We apply a watershed algorithm todensity maps constructed from point source catalogues Gaussian smoothed tomultiple physical scales from 8 to 64 pc. We develop our method on two galaxiesthat span the distance range in the PHANGS-HST sample: NGC 3351 (10 Mpc), NGC1566 (18 Mpc). We test our algorithm with different parameters such as thechoice of detection band for the point source catalogue (NUV or V), sourcedensity image filtering methods, and absolute magnitude limits. We characterisethe properties of the resulting multi-scale associations, including sizes,number of tracer stars, number of associations, photometry, as well as ages,masses, and reddening from Spectral Energy Distribution fitting. Our methodsuccessfully identifies structures that occupy loci in the UBVI colour-colourdiagram consistent with previously published catalogues of clusters andassociations. The median ages of the associations increases from log(age/yr) =6.6 to log(age/yr) = 6.9 as the spatial scale increases from 8 pc to 64 pc forboth galaxies. We find that the youngest stellar associations, with ages < 3Myr, indeed closely trace H ii regions in H$\alpha$ imaging, and that olderassociations are increasingly anti-correlated with the H$\alpha$ emission.Owing to our new method, the PHANGS-HST multi-scale associations provide a farmore complete census of recent star formation activity than found with previouscluster and compact association catalogues. The method presented here will beapplied to the full sample of 38 PHANGS-HST galaxies.|

|**Abstract**| A primary new capability of JWST is the ability to penetrate the dust in starforming galaxies to identify and study the properties of young star clustersthat remain embedded in dust and gas. In this paper we combine new infraredimages taken with JWST with our optical HST images of the star-bursting barred(Seyfert2) spiral galaxy NGC 1365. We find that this galaxy has the richestpopulation of massive young clusters of any known galaxy within 30 Mpc, with$\sim$ 30 star clusters that are more massive than 10$^6$ Msolar and youngerthan 10 Myr. Sixteen of these clusters are newly discovered from our JWSTobservations. An examination of the optical images reveals that 4 of 30($\sim$13$\%$) are so deeply embedded that they cannot be seen in the I band(AV $\gt$ 10 mag), and that 11 of 30 ($\sim$37$\%$) are missing in the HST Bband, so age and mass estimates from optical measurements alone arechallenging. These numbers suggest that massive clusters in NGC 1365 remainobscured in the visible for $\sim$ 1.3 $\pm$ 0.7 Myr, and are either completelyor partially obscured for $\sim$ 3.7 $\pm$ 1.1 Myr. We also use the JWSTobservations to gain new insights into the triggering of star cluster formationby the collision of gas and dust streamers with gas and dust in the bar. TheJWST images reveal previously unknown structures (e.g., bridges and overshootregions from stars that form in the bar) that help us better understand theorbital dynamics of barred galaxies and associated star-forming rings. Finally,we note that the excellent spatial resolution of the NIRCAM F200W filterprovides a better way to separate barely resolved compact clusters fromindividual stars based on their sizes.|

|**Abstract**| We present maps tracing the fraction of dust in the form of polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in IC 5332, NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496 fromJWST/MIRI observations. We trace the PAH fraction by combining the F770W($7.7~\mu$m) and F1130W ($11.3~\mu$m) filters to track ionized and neutral PAHemission, respectively, and comparing the PAH emission to F2100W which tracessmall, hot dust grains. We find average $R{\rm_{PAH} = (F770W+F1130W)/F2100W}$values of 3.3, 4.7, 5.1, and 3.6 in IC 5332, NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496,respectively. We find that H II regions traced by MUSE H$\alpha$ show asystematically low PAH fraction. The PAH fraction remains relatively constantacross other galactic environments, with slight variations. We use CO + H I +H$\alpha$ to trace the interstellar gas phase and find that the PAH fractiondecreases above a value of I$_{H\alpha}/\Sigma_{H~I+H_2}$ $\sim~10^{37.5}$ ergs$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ (M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$)$^{-1}$, in all four galaxies. Radialprofiles also show a decreasing PAH fraction with increasing radius, correlatedwith lower metallicity, in line with previous results showing a strongmetallicity dependence to the PAH fraction. Our results suggest that theprocess of PAH destruction in ionized gas operates similarly across the fourtargets.|

|**Abstract**| PHANGS-JWST mid-infrared (MIR) imaging of nearby spiral galaxies has revealedubiquitous filaments of dust emission in intricate detail. We present a pilotstudy to systematically map the dust filament network (DFN) at multiple scalesbetween 25-400 pc in NGC 628. MIRI images at 7.7, 10, 11.3 and 21$\mu$m of NGC628 are used to generate maps of the filaments in emission, while PHANGS-HSTB-band imaging yields maps of dust attenuation features. We quantify thecorrespondence between filaments traced by MIR thermal continuum / polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission and filaments detected via extinction /scattering of visible light; the fraction of MIR flux contained in the DFN; andthe fraction of HII regions, young star clusters and associations within theDFN. We examine the dependence of these quantities with the physical scale atwhich the DFN is extracted. With our highest resolution DFN maps (25 pcfilament width), we find that filaments in emission and attenuation areco-spatial in 40% of sight lines, often exhibiting detailed morphologicalagreement; that ~30% of the MIR flux is associated with the DFN; and that75-80% of HII regions and 60% of star clusters younger than 5 Myr are containedwithin the DFN. However, the DFN at this scale is anti-correlated with looserassociations of stars younger than 5 Myr identified using PHANGS-HST near-UVimaging. We discuss the impact of these findings for studies of star formationand the ISM, and the broad range of new investigations enabled with multi-scalemaps of the DFN.|

|**Abstract**| We present ALMA Band-3/7 observations towards "the Heart" of a massivehub-filament system (HFS) SDC335, to investigate its fragmentation andaccretion. At a resolution of $\sim0.03$ pc, 3 mm continuum emission resolvestwo massive dense cores MM1 and MM2, with $383(^{+234}_{-120})$ $M_\odot$(10-24% mass of "the Heart") and $74(^{+47}_{-24})$ $M_\odot$, respectively.With a resolution down to 0.01 pc, 0.87 mm continuum emission shows MM1 furtherfragments into six condensations and multi-transition lines of H$_2$CS providetemperature estimation. The relation between separation and mass ofcondensations at a scale of 0.01 pc favors turbulent Jeans fragmentation wherethe turbulence seems to be scale-free rather than scale-dependent. We use theH$^{13}$CO$^+$ (1-0) emission line to resolve the complex gas motion inside"the Heart" in position-position-velocity space. We identify four major gasstreams connected to large-scale filaments, inheriting the anti-clockwisespiral pattern. Along these streams, gas feeds the central massive core MM1.Assuming an inclination angle of $45(\pm15)^{\circ}$ and a H$^{13}$CO$^+$abundance of $5(\pm3)\times10^{-11}$, the total mass infall rate is estimatedto be $2.40(\pm0.78)\times10^{-3}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, numerically consistentwith the accretion rates derived from the clump-scale spherical infall modeland the core-scale outflows. The consistency suggests a continuous, nearsteady-state, and efficient accretion from global collapse, therefore ensuringcore feeding. Our comprehensive study of SDC335 showcases the detailed gaskinematics in a prototypical massive infalling clump and calls for furthersystematic and statistical analyses in a large sample.|

|**Abstract**| Whether ionization feedback triggers the formation of massive stars is highlydebated. Using ALMA 3 mm observations with a spatial resolution of $\sim 0.05$pc and a mass sensitivity of 1.1 $\rm M_\odot$ beam$^{-1}$ at 20 K, weinvestigate the star formation and gas flow structures within the ionizingfeedback-driven structure, a clump-scale massive ($\gtrsim 1500$ $\rm M_\odot$)bright-rimmed cloud (BRC) associated with IRAS 18290-0924. This BRC is boundonly if external compression from ionized gas is considered. A small-scale($\lesssim1$ pc) age sequence along the direction of ionizing radiation isrevealed for the embedded cores and protostars, which suggests triggered starformation via radiation-driven implosion (RDI). Furthermore, filamentary gasstructures converge towards the cores located in the BRC's center, indicatingthat these filaments are fueling mass towards cores. The local core-scale massinfall rate derived from H$^{13}$CO$^+$ $J=1-0$ blue profile is of the sameorder of magnitude as the filamentary mass inflow rate, approximately 1 $\rmM_\odot$ kyr$^{-1}$. A photodissociation region (PDR) covering the irradiatedclump surface is detected in several molecules, such as CCH, HCO$^+$, and CSwhereas the spatial distribution stratification of these molecules isindistinct. CCH spectra of the PDR possibly indicate a photoevaporation flowleaving the clump surface with a projected velocity of $\sim2$ km s$^{-1}$. Ournew observations show that RDI accompanied by a clump-fed process is operatingin this massive BRC. Whether this combined process works in other massive BRCsis worth exploring with dedicated surveys.|

|**Abstract**| Using MIRI on-board JWST we present mid-infrared sub-arcsec imaging (MIRIM)and spectroscopy (MRS) of the hyperluminous infrared system SPT0311-58 atz=6.9. MIRI observations are compared with existing ALMA far-infrared continuumand [CII]158$\mu$m imaging. Even though the ALMA observations suggests veryhigh star formation rates (SFR) in the eastern (E) and western (W) galaxies ofthe system, the H$\alpha$ line is not detected. This, together with thedetection of the Pa$\alpha$ line, implies very high optical nebular extinctionwith lower limits of 4.2 (E) and 3.9 mag (W), and even larger 5.6 (E) and 10.0(W) for SED derived values. The extinction-corrected Pa$\alpha$ SFRs are 383and 230M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the E and W galaxies, respectively. Thisrepresents 50% of the SFRs derived from the [CII]158$\mu$m line and infraredlight for the E galaxy and as low as 6% for the W galaxy. The MIRI observationsreveal a clumpy stellar structure, with each clump having 3 to 5$\times$10$^{9}$M$_\mathrm{\odot}$, leading to a total stellar mass of 2.0 and1.5$\times$10$^{10}$M$_\mathrm{\odot}$ for the E and W galaxies, respectively.The specific SFR in the stellar clumps ranges from 25 to 59Gyr$^{-1}$, whichare 3 to 10 times larger than the values measured in galaxies of similar massat redshifts 6 to 8. The overall gas mass fraction is$M_\mathrm{gas}$/$M_*\sim3$, similar to that of z=4.5-6 star-forming galaxies.The observed properties of SPT0311-58 such as the clumpy distribution atsub(kpc) scales and the very high average extinction are similar to thoseobserved in low- and intermediate-z LIRGs and ULIRGs, even though SPT0311-58 isobserved only 800 Myr after the Big Bang. Massive, heavily obscured, clumpystarburst systems like SPT0311-58 likely represent the early phases in theformation of massive high-z bulge/spheroids and luminous quasars.|

|**Abstract**| We present the discovery of an Earth-mass planet ($M_b\sin i =1.26\pm0.21M_\oplus$) on a 15.6d orbit of a relatively nearby ($d\sim$9.6pc)and low-mass ($0.167\pm0.011 M_\odot$) M5.0V star, Wolf 1069. Sitting at aseparation of $0.0672\pm0.0014$au away from the host star puts Wolf 1069b inthe habitable zone (HZ), receiving an incident flux of$S=0.652\pm0.029S_\oplus$. The planetary signal was detected usingtelluric-corrected radial-velocity (RV) data from the CARMENES spectrograph,amounting to a total of 262 spectroscopic observations covering almost fouryears. There are additional long-period signals in the RVs, one of which weattribute to the stellar rotation period. This is possible thanks to ourphotometric analysis including new, well-sampled monitoring campaigns undergonewith the OSN and TJO facilities that supplement archival photometry (i.e., fromMEarth and SuperWASP), and this yielded an updated rotational period range of$P_{rot}=150-170$d, with a likely value at $169.3^{+3.7}_{-3.6}$d. The stellaractivity indicators provided by the CARMENES spectra likewise demonstrateevidence for the slow rotation period, though not as accurately due to possiblefactors such as signal aliasing or spot evolution. Our detectability limitsindicate that additional planets more massive than one Earth mass with orbitalperiods of less than 10 days can be ruled out, suggesting that perhaps Wolf1069 b had a violent formation history. This planet is also the 6th closestEarth-mass planet situated in the conservative HZ, after Proxima Centauri b, GJ1061d, Teegarden's Star c, and GJ 1002 b and c. Despite not transiting, Wolf1069b is nonetheless a very promising target for future three-dimensionalclimate models to investigate various habitability cases as well as forsub-ms$^{-1}$ RV campaigns to search for potential inner sub-Earth-mass planetsin order to test planet formation theories.|

|**Abstract**| We present the first exoplanet phase curve measurement made with the JWSTNIRSpec instrument, highlighting the exceptional stability of thisnewly-commissioned observatory for exoplanet climate studies. The target,WASP-121b, is an ultrahot Jupiter with an orbital period of 30.6 hr. We analyzetwo broadband light curves generated for the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors, coveringwavelength ranges of 2.70-3.72 micron and 3.82-5.15 micron, respectively. Bothlight curves exhibit minimal systematics, with approximately linear drifts inthe baseline flux level of 30 ppm/hr (NRS1) and 10 ppm/hr (NRS2). Assuming asimple brightness map for the planet described by a low-order sphericalharmonic dipole, our light curve fits suggest that the phase curve peakscoincide with orbital phases $3.36 \pm 0.11$ deg (NRS1) and $2.66 \pm 0.12$ deg(NRS2) prior to mid-eclipse. This is consistent with the strongest daysideemission emanating from eastward of the substellar point. We measureplanet-to-star emission ratios of $3,924 \pm 7$ ppm (NRS1) and $4,924 \pm 9$ppm (NRS2) for the dayside hemisphere, and $136 \pm 8$ ppm (NRS1) and $630 \pm10$ ppm (NRS2) for the nightside hemisphere. The latter nightside emissionratios translate to planetary brightness temperatures of $926 \pm 12$ K (NRS1)and $1,122 \pm 10$ K (NRS2), which are low enough for a wide range ofrefractory condensates to form, including enstatite and forsterite. A nightsidecloud deck may be blocking emission from deeper, hotter layers of theatmosphere, potentially helping to explain why cloud-free 3D generalcirculation model simulations systematically over-predict the nightsideemission for WASP-121b.|

|**Abstract**| A long-standing problem when deriving the physical properties of stellarpopulations is the degeneracy between age, reddening, and metallicity. When asingle metallicity is used for all star clusters in a galaxy, this degeneracycan result in $`$catastrophic$'$ errors for old globular clusters. Typically,approximately 10 - 20 % of all clusters detected in spiral galaxies can haveages that are incorrect by a factor of ten or more. In this paper we present apilot study for four galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 1433, NGC 1365, and NGC 3351) fromthe PHANGS-HST survey. We describe methods to correct the age-dating for oldglobular clusters, by first identifying candidates using their colors, and thenreassigning ages and reddening based on a lower metallicity solution. We findthat young $`$interlopers$'$ can be identified from their Halpha flux. CO (2-1)intensity or the presence of dust can also be used, but our tests show thatthey do not work as well. Improvements in the success fraction are possible atthe $\sim$ 15 % level (reducing the fraction of catastrophic age-estimates frombetween 13 - 21 % to 3 - 8 %). A large fraction of the incorrectly age-datedglobular clusters are systematically given ages around 100 Myr, polluting theyounger populations as well. Incorrectly age-dated globular clusterssignificantly impact the observed cluster age distribution in NGC 628, whichaffects the physical interpretation of cluster disruption in this galaxy. ForNGC 1365, we also demonstrate how to fix a second major age-dating problem,where very dusty young clusters with E(B-V) $>$ 1.5 mag are assigned old,globular-cluster like ages. Finally, we note the discovery of a densepopulation of $\sim$ 300 Myr clusters around the central region of NGC 1365.and discuss how this results naturally from the dynamics in a barred galaxy.|

|**Abstract**| Ionized nebulae provide critical insights into the conditions of theinterstellar medium (ISM). Their bright emission lines enable the measurementof physical properties, such as the gas-phase metallicity, across galaxy disksand in distant galaxies. The PHANGS--MUSE survey has produced opticalspectroscopic coverage of the central star-forming discs of 19 nearbymain-sequence galaxies. Here, we use the H{\alpha} morphology from this data toidentify 30,790 distinct nebulae, finding thousands of nebulae per galaxy. Foreach nebula, we extract emission line fluxes and, using diagnostic line ratios,identify the dominant excitation mechanism. A total of 23,244 nebulae (75%) areclassified as HII regions. The dust attenuation of every nebulae ischaracterised via the Balmer decrement and we use existing environmental masksto identify their large scale galactic environment (centre, bar, arm, interarmand disc). Using strong-line prescriptions, we measure the gas-phase oxygenabundances (metallicity) and ionization parameter for all HII regions. Withthis new catalogue, we measure the radial metallicity gradients and exploresecond order metallicity variations within each galaxy. By quantifying theglobal scatter in metallicity per galaxy, we find a weak negative correlationwith global star formation rate and stronger negative correlation with globalgas velocity dispersion (in both ionized and molecular gas). With this paper werelease the full catalogue of strong line fluxes and derived properties,providing a rich database for a broad variety of ISM studies.|

|**Abstract**| Detecting a planetary companion in a short-period orbit through radioemission from the interaction with its host star is a new prospect in exoplanetscience. Recently, a tantalising signal was found close to the low-mass stellarsystem GJ 1151 using LOFAR observations. We studied spectroscopic time-seriesdata of GJ 1151 in order to search for planetary companions, investigatepossible signatures of stellar magnetic activity, and to find possibleexplanations for the radio signal. We used the combined radial velocitiesmeasured from spectra acquired with the CARMENES, HARPS-N, and HPF instruments,extracted activity indices from those spectra in order to mitigate the impactof stellar magnetic activity on the data, and performed a detailed analysis ofGaia astrometry and all available photometric time series coming from theMEarth and ASAS-SN surveys. We found a M$>$10.6 M$_{\oplus}$ companion to GJ1151 in a 390d orbit at a separation of 0.57 au. Evidence for a secondmodulation is also present; this could be due to long-term magnetic variabilityor a second (substellar) companion. The star shows episodes of elevatedmagnetic activity, one of which could be linked to the observed LOFAR radioemission. We show that it is highly unlikely that the detected GJ 1151 b, orany additional outer companion is the source of the detected signal. We cannotfirmly rule out the suggested explanation of an undetected short-period planetthat could be related to the radio emission, as we establish an upper limit of1.2 M$_{\oplus}$ for the minimum mass.|

|**Abstract**| Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been observed as far as redshift z~7. Theyare crucial in investigating the early Universe as well as the growth ofsupermassive black holes at their centres. Radio-loud AGN with their jets seenat a small viewing angle are called blazars and show relativistic boosting oftheir emission. Thus, their apparently brighter jets are easier to detect inthe high-redshift Universe. DES J014132.4-542749.9 is a radio-luminous butX-ray weak blazar candidate at z = 5. We conducted high-resolution radiointerferometric observations of this source with the Australian Long BaselineArray at 1.7 and 8.5 GHz. A single, compact radio emitting feature was detectedat both frequencies with a flat radio spectrum. We derived themilliarcsecond-level accurate position of the object. The frequency dependenceof its brightness temperature is similar to that of blazar sources observed atlower redshifts. Based on our observations, we can confirm its blazar nature.We compared its radio properties with those of two other similarly X-ray-weakand radio-bright AGN, and found that they show very different relativisticboosting characteristics.|

|**Abstract**| Aims. We want to find the distribution of initial conditions that bestreproduces disc observations at the population level. Methods. We first ran aparameter study using a 1D model that includes the viscous evolution of a gasdisc, dust, and pebbles, coupled with an emission model to compute themillimetre flux observable with ALMA. This was used to train a machine learningsurrogate model that can compute the relevant quantity for comparison withobservations in seconds. This surrogate model was used to perform parameterstudies and synthetic disc populations. Results. Performing a parameter study,we find that internal photoevaporation leads to a lower dependency of disclifetime on stellar mass than external photoevaporation. This dependence shouldbe investigated in the future. Performing population synthesis, we find thatunder the combined losses of internal and external photoevaporation, discs aretoo short lived. Conclusions. To match observational constraints, future modelsof disc evolution need to include one or a combination of the followingprocesses: infall of material to replenish the discs, shielding of the discfrom internal photoevaporation due to magnetically driven disc winds, andextinction of external high-energy radiation. Nevertheless, disc properties inlow-external-photoevaporation regions can be reproduced by having more massiveand compact discs. Here, the optimum values of the $\alpha$ viscosity parameterlie between $3\times10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$ and with internal photoevaporationbeing the main mode of disc dispersal.|

|**Abstract**| Context. Our Galaxy is composed of different stellar populations with varyingchemical abundances, which are thought to imprint the composition of planetbuilding blocks (PBBs). As such, the properties of stars should affect theproperties of planets and small bodies formed in their systems. In thiscontext, high-resolution spectroscopic surveys open a window into the chemicallinks between and their host stars.Aims. We aim to determine the PBB composition trends for various stellarpopulations across the Galaxy by comparing the two large spectroscopic surveysAPOGEE and GALAH. We assess the reliability of the PBB composition asdetermined with these surveys with a propagation error study.Methods. Stellar spectroscopic abundances from the large surveys GALAH-DR3and APOGEE-DR17 were used as input with a stoichiometric condensation model. Weclassified stars into different Galactic components and we quantified the PBBcomposition trends as a function of [Fe/H]. We also analysed the distributioncomposition patterns in the [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] diagram.Results. Our propagation error study suggests that the overall trends with[Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] are robust, which is supported by the double study ofboth APOGEE and GALAH. We therefore confirm the existence of a bimodal PBBcomposition separating the thin disc stars from the thick disc stars.Furthermore, we confirm that the stoichiometric water PBB content isanti-correlated with [Fe/H].Conclusions. Our results imply that metal-poor stars both in the thin andthick disks are suitable hosts for water-rich PBBs and for ice-rich smallbodies. However, for metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<0), the PBBs around thick discstars should have a higher water content than that around thin disc starsbecause of the $\alpha$-contentdependence of the water mass fraction.|

|**Abstract**| We present new 0.3-21 micron photometry of SN 2021aefx in the spiral galaxyNGC 1566 at +357 days after B-band maximum, including the first detection ofany SN Ia at >15 micron. These observations follow earlier JWST observations ofSN 2021aefx at +255 days after the time of maximum brightness, allowing us toprobe the temporal evolution of the emission properties. We measure thefraction of flux emerging at different wavelengths and its temporal evolution.Additionally, the integrated 0.3-14 micron decay rate of $\Delta m_{0.3-14} =1.35 \pm 0.05$ mag/100 days is higher than the decline rate from theradioactive decay of $^{56}$Co of $\sim 1.2$mag/100 days. The most plausibleexplanation for this discrepancy is that flux is shifting to >14 micron, andfuture JWST observations of SNe Ia will be able to directly test thishypothesis. However, models predicting non-radiative energy loss cannot beexcluded with the present data.|

|**Abstract**| Retrieving the physical parameters from spectroscopic observations ofexoplanets is key to understanding their atmospheric properties. Exoplanetaryatmospheric retrievals are usually based on approximate Bayesian inference andrely on sampling-based approaches to compute parameter posterior distributions.Accurate or repeated retrievals, however, can result in very long computationtimes due to the sequential nature of sampling-based algorithms. We aim toamortize exoplanetary atmospheric retrieval using neural posterior estimation(NPE), a simulation-based inference algorithm based on variational inferenceand normalizing flows. In this way, we aim (i) to strongly reduce inferencetime, (ii) to scale inference to complex simulation models with many nuisanceparameters or intractable likelihood functions, and (iii) to enable thestatistical validation of the inference results. We evaluate NPE on a radiativetransfer model for exoplanet spectra petitRADTRANS, including the effects ofscattering and clouds. We train a neural autoregressive flow to quicklyestimate posteriors and compare against retrievals computed with MultiNest. NPEproduces accurate posterior approximations while reducing inference time downto a few seconds. We demonstrate the computational faithfulness of ourposterior approximations using inference diagnostics including posteriorpredictive checks and coverage, taking advantage of the quasi-instantaneousinference time of NPE. Our analysis confirms the reliability of the approximateposteriors produced by NPE. The accuracy and reliability of the inferenceresults produced by NPE establishes it as a promising approach for atmosphericretrievals. Amortization of the posterior inference makes repeated inference onseveral observations computationally inexpensive since it does not requireon-the-fly simulations, making the retrieval efficient, scalable, and testable.|

|**Abstract**| One of the main scientific goals of the TESS mission is the discovery oftransiting small planets around the closest and brightest stars in the sky.Here, using data from the CARMENES, MAROON-X, and HIRES spectrographs, togetherwith TESS, we report the discovery and mass determination of a planetary systemaround the M1.5 V star GJ 806 (TOI-4481). GJ 806 is a bright (V=10.8 mag, J=7.3mag) and nearby (d=12 pc) M dwarf that hosts at least two planets. Theinnermost planet, GJ 806 b, is transiting and has an ultra-short orbital periodof 0.93 d, a radius of 1.331+-0.023 Re, a mass of 1.90+-0.17 Me, a mean densityof 4.40+-0.45 g/cm3, and an equilibrium temperature of 940+-10 K. We detect asecond, non-transiting, super-Earth planet in the system, GJ 806c, with anorbital period of 6.6 d, a minimum mass of 5.80+-0.30 Me, and an equilibriumtemperature of 490+-5 K. The radial velocity data also shows evidence for athird periodicity at 13.6 d, although the current dataset does not providesufficient evidence to unambiguously distinguish between a third super-Earthmass (Msin(i)=8.50+-0.45 Me) planet or stellar activity. Additionally, wereport one transit observation of GJ 806 b taken with CARMENES in search for apossible extended atmosphere of H or He, but we can only place upper limits toits existence. This is not surprising as our evolutionary models support theidea that any possible primordial H/He atmosphere that GJ 806 b might have had,would long have been lost. However, GJ 806b's bulk density makes it likely thatthe planet hosts some type of volatile atmosphere. In fact, with a transmissionspectroscopy metrics (TSM) of 44 and an emission spectroscopy metrics (ESM) of24, GJ 806 b the third-ranked terrestrial planet around an M dwarf suitable fortransmission spectroscopy studies, and the most promising terrestrial planetfor emission spectroscopy studies.|

|**Abstract**| EX Lup is a low-mass pre-main sequence star that occasionally showsaccretion-related outbursts. Here, we present JWST/MIRI medium resolutionspectroscopy obtained for EX Lup fourteen years after its powerful outburst. EXLup is now in quiescence and displays a Class II spectrum. We detect a forestof emission lines from molecules previously identified in infrared spectra ofclassical T Tauri disks: H2O, OH, H2, HCN, C2H2, and CO2. The detection oforganic molecules demonstrates that they are back after disappearing during thelarge outburst. Spectral lines from water and OH are for the first timede-blended and will provide a much improved characterization of theirdistribution and density in the inner disk. The spectrum also shows broademission bands from warm, sub-micron size amorphous silicate grains at 10 and18 um. During the outburst, in 2008, crystalline forsterite grains wereannealed in the inner disk within 1 au, but their spectral signatures in the 10um silicate band later disappeared. With JWST we re-discovered these crystalsvia their 19.0, 20.0, and 23.5 um emission, whose strength implies that theparticles are at ~3 au from the star. This suggests that crystalline grainsformed in 2008 were transported outwards and now approach the water snowline,where they may be incorporated into planetesimals. Containing several keytracers of planetesimal and planet formation, EX Lup is an ideal laboratory tostudy the effects of variable luminosity on the planet-forming material and mayprovide explanation for the observed high crystalline fraction in solar systemcomets.|

|**Abstract**| Icy grain mantles are the main reservoir of the volatile elements that linkchemical processes in dark, interstellar clouds with the formation of planetsand composition of their atmospheres. The initial ice composition is set in thecold, dense parts of molecular clouds, prior to the onset of star formation.With the exquisite sensitivity of JWST, this critical stage of ice evolution isnow accessible for detailed study. Here we show the first results of the EarlyRelease Science program "Ice Age" that reveal the rich composition of thesedense cloud ices. Weak ices, including, $^{13}$CO$_2$, OCN$^-$, $^{13}$CO, OCS,and COMs functional groups are now detected along two pre-stellar lines ofsight. The $^{12}$CO$_2$ ice profile indicates modest growth of the icy grains.Column densities of the major and minor ice species indicate that icescontribute between 2 and 19% of the bulk budgets of the key C, O, N, and Selements. Our results suggest that the formation of simple and complexmolecules could begin early in a water-ice rich environment.|

|**Abstract**| We trace the evolution of the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 3501, making use ofits stellar populations extracted from deep integral-field spectroscopy MUSEobservations. We present stellar kinematic and population maps, as well as thestar formation history, of the south-western half of the galaxy. The derivedmaps of the stellar line-of-sight velocity and velocity dispersion are quiteregular, show disc-like rotation, and no other structural component of thegalaxy. However, maps of the stellar populations exhibit structures in themass-weighted and light-weighted age, total metallicity and [Mg/Fe] abundance.These maps indicate that NGC 3501 is a young galaxy, consisting mostly of starswith ages between 2 to 8 Gyr. Also, they show a thicker more extended structurethat is metal-poor and $\alpha$-rich, and another inner metal-rich and$\alpha$-poor one with smaller radial extension. While previous studiesrevealed that NGC 3501 shows only one morphological disc component in itsvertical structure, we divided the galaxy into two regions: an inner metal-richmidplane and a metal-poor thicker envelope. Comparing the star formationhistory of the inner thinner metal-rich disc and the thicker metal-poor disc,we see that the metal-rich component evolved more steadily, while themetal-poor one experienced several bursts of star formation. We propose thisspiral galaxy is being observed in an early evolutionary phase, with a thickerdisc already in place and an inner thin disc in an early formation stage. So weare probably witnessing the birth of a future massive thin disc, continuouslygrowing embedded in a preexisting thicker disc.|

|**Abstract**| Recent integral-field spectroscopy observations have revealed that thick- andthin-disk star-formation histories are regulated by the interplay of internaland external processes. We analyze stellar-population properties of 24 spiralgalaxies from the AURIGA zoom-in cosmological simulations, to offer a morein-depth interpretation of observable properties. We present edge-on maps ofstellar age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] abundance, and we extract thestar-formation and chemical-evolution histories of thin and thick disks. Bothshow signs of the interplay between internal chemical enrichment and gas andstar accretion. Thick disks show particularly complex stellar populations,including an in-situ component, formed from both slowly enriched and accretedmore pristine gas, and an additional significant fraction of ex-situ stars.|

|**Abstract**| The JWST is revolutionizing the study of high-redshift galaxies by providingfor the first time a high-sensitivity view of the early Universe at infraredwavelengths, both with its Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid InfraredInstrument (MIRI). In this paper, we make use of medium and broad-band NIRCamimaging, as well as ultra-deep MIRI 5.6 microns imaging, in the Hubble eXtremeDeep Field (XDF) to identify prominent line emitters at z ~ 7-8. Out of a totalof 58 galaxies at z ~ 7-8, we find 18 robust candidates (~31%) for prominent(Hb + [OIII]) emitters, based on their enhanced fluxes in the F430M and F444Wfilters, with rest-frame EW(Hb + [OIII]) ~ 87 - 2100 A. Among these emitters,16 lie on the MIRI coverage area and 12 show a clear flux excess at 5.6microns, indicating the simultaneous presence of a prominent Ha emission linewith rest-frame EW(Ha) ~ 200 - 3000 A. This is the first time that Ha emissioncan be detected in individual galaxies at z>7. The Ha line, when present,allows us to separate the contributions of the Hb and [OIII] emission lines tothe (Hb + [OIII]) complex and derive Ha-based star formation rates (SFRs). Wefind that in some cases [OIII]/Hb > 1, suggesting low metallicities, but a fewhave [OIII]/Hb < 1, so the NIRCam flux excess is mainly driven by Hb. The vastmajority of prominent line emitters are very young starbursts or galaxies ontheir way to/from the starburst cloud. They make for a cosmic SFR densitylog10(SFRD_Ha / Msun yr^-1 Mpc^-3) ~ 2.35, which is about a third of the totalvalue at z ~ 7-8. Therefore, the strong Ha emitters likely had an importantrole in reionization.|

|**Abstract**| We investigate the origin of stars in the innermost $500\,\mathrm{pc}$ ofgalaxies spanning stellar masses of $5\times10^{8-12}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ at$\mathrm{z=0}$ using the cosmological magnetohydrodynamical TNG50 simulation.Three different origins of stars comprise galactic centers: 1) in-situ (born inthe center), 2) migrated (born elsewhere in the galaxy and ultimately moved tothe center), 3) ex-situ (accreted from other galaxies). In-situ and migratedstars dominate the central stellar mass budget on average with 73% and 23%respectively. The ex-situ fraction rises above 1% for galaxies$\gtrsim10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Yet, only 9% of all galaxies exhibit noex-situ stars in their centers and the scatter of ex-situ mass is significant($4-6\,\mathrm{dex}$). Migrated stars predominantly originate closely from thecenter ($1-2\,\mathrm{kpc}$), but if they travelled together in clumpsdistances reach $\sim10\,\mathrm{kpc}$. Central and satellite galaxies possesssimilar amounts and origins of central stars. Star forming galaxies($\gtrsim10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) have on average more ex-situ mass intheir centers than quenched ones. We predict readily observable stellarpopulation and dynamical properties: 1) migrated stars are distinctly young($\sim2\,\mathrm{Gyr}$) and rotationally supported, especially for Milky Waymass galaxies, 2) in-situ stars are most metal-rich and older than migratedstars, 3) ex-situ stars are on random motion dominated orbits and typically theoldest, most metal-poor and $\alpha$-enhanced population. We demonstrate thatthe interaction history with other galaxies leads to diverse pathways ofbuilding up galaxy centers in a $\Lambda$CDM universe. Our work highlights thenecessity for cosmological context in formation scenarios of central galacticcomponents and the potential to use galaxy centers as tracers of overall galaxyassembly.|

|**Abstract**| Recent cosmic shear studies have shown that higher-order statistics (HOS)developed by independent teams now outperform standard two-point estimators interms of statistical precision thanks to their sensitivity to the non-Gaussianfeatures of large-scale structure. The aim of the Higher-Order Weak LensingStatistics (HOWLS) project is to assess, compare, and combine the constrainingpower of $10$ different HOS on a common set of $Euclid$-like mocks, derivedfrom N-body simulations. In this first paper of the HOWLS series we compute thenon-tomographic ($\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\sigma_8$) Fisher information for one-pointprobability distribution function, peak counts, Minkowski functionals, Bettinumbers, persistent homology Betti numbers and heatmap, and scatteringtransform coefficients, and compare them to the shear and convergence two-pointcorrelation functions in the absence of any systematic bias. We also includeforecasts for three implementations of higher-order moments, but these cannotbe robustly interpreted as the Gaussian likelihood assumption breaks down forthese statistics. Taken individually, we find that each HOS outperforms thetwo-point statistics by a factor of around $2$ in the precision of theforecasts with some variations across statistics and cosmological parameters.When combining all the HOS, this increases to a $4.5$ times improvement,highlighting the immense potential of HOS for cosmic shear cosmologicalanalyses with $Euclid$. The data used in this analysis are publicly releasedwith the paper.|

|**Abstract**| We present new neutral hydrogen (HI) observations of the nearby galaxy NGC2403 to determine the nature of a low-column density cloud that was detectedearlier by the Green Bank Telescope. We find that this cloud is the tip of acomplex of filaments of extraplanar gas that is coincident with the thin disk.The total HI mass of the complex is $2\times10^{7}\text{ M}_\odot$ or 0.6% ofthe total HI mass of the galaxy. The main structure, previously referred to asthe 8-kpc filament, is now seen to be even more extended, along a 20 kpcstream. The kinematics and morphological properties of the filaments areunlikely to be the result of outflows related to galactic fountains. It is morelikely that the 20 kpc filament is related to a recent galaxy interaction. Inthis context, a $\sim$ 50 kpc long stellar stream has been recently detectedconnecting NGC 2403 with the nearby dwarf satellite DDO 44. Intriguingly, thesouthern tip of this stream overlaps with that of 20 kpc HI filament. Weconclude that the HII anomalies in NGC 2403 are the result of a recent($\sim2\text{ Gyr}$) interaction with DDO 44 leading to the observedfilamentary complex.|

In this paper, we summarize thein-orbit performance of NIRSpec, as derived from data collected during itscommissioning campaign and the first few months of nominal science operations.More specifically, we discuss the performance of some critical hardwarecomponents such as the two NIRSpec Hawaii-2RG (H2RG) detectors, wheelmechanisms, and the micro-shutter array. We also summarize the accuracy of thetwo target acquisition procedures used to accurately place science targets intothe slit apertures, discuss the current status of the spectro-photometric andwavelength calibration of NIRSpec spectra, and provide the as measuredsensitivity in all NIRSpec science modes. Finally, we point out a few importantconsiderations for the preparation of NIRSpec science programs.|

|**Abstract**| We present new HCN and HCO$^+$ ($J$=3-2) images of the nearby star-forminggalaxies (SFGs) NGC 3351, NGC 3627, and NGC 4321. The observations, obtainedwith the Morita ALMA Compact Array, have a spatial resolution of $\sim$290-440pc and resolve the inner $R_\textrm{gal} \lesssim$ 0.6-1 kpc of the targets, aswell as the southern bar end of NGC 3627. We complement this data set withpublicly available images of lower excitation lines of HCN, HCO$^+$, and CO andanalyse the behaviour of a representative set of line ratios:HCN(3-2)/HCN(1-0), HCN(3-2)/HCO$^+$(3-2), HCN(1-0)/CO(2-1), andHCN(3-2)/CO(2-1). Most of these ratios peak at the galaxy centres and decreaseoutwards. We compare the HCN and HCO$^+$ observations with a grid of one-phase,non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative transfer models andfind them compatible with models that predict subthermally excited andoptically thick lines. We study the systematic variations of the line ratiosacross the targets as a function of the stellar surface density($\Sigma_\textrm{star}$), the intensity-weighted CO(2-1) ($\langleI_\text{CO}\rangle$), and the star formation rate surface density($\Sigma_\text{SFR}$). We find no apparent correlation with$\Sigma_\text{SFR}$, but positive correlations with the other two parameters,which are stronger in the case of $\langle I_\text{CO}\rangle$. TheHCN/CO-$\langle I_\text{CO}\rangle$ relations show $\lesssim$0.3 dexgalaxy-to-galaxy offsets, with HCN(3-2)/CO(2-1)-$\langle I_\text{CO}\rangle$being $\sim$2 times steeper than HCN(1-0)/CO(2-1). In contrast, theHCN(3-2)/HCN(1-0)-$\langle I_\text{CO}\rangle$ relation exhibits a tighteralignment between galaxies. We conclude that the overall behaviour of the lineratios cannot be ascribed to variations in a single excitation parameter (e.g.density or temperature).|

|**Abstract**| Recent models for the inner structure of active galactic nuclei (AGN)advocate the presence of a radiatively accelerated, dusty outflow launched fromthe outer regions of the accretion disk. Here we present the firstnear-infrared (near-IR) variable (rms) spectrum for the high-luminosity, nearbyAGN Mrk 876. We find that it tracks the accretion disk spectrum out to longerwavelengths than the mean spectrum due to a reduced dust emission. The impliedouter accretion disk radius is consistent with the infrared results predictedby a contemporaneous optical accretion disk reverberation mapping campaign andmuch larger than the self-gravity radius. The reduced flux variability of thehot dust could be either due to the presence of a secondary, constant dustcomponent in the mean spectrum or introduced by the destructive superpositionof the dust and accretion disk variability signals or some combination of both.Assuming thermal equilibrium for optically thin dust, we derive theluminosity-based dust radius for different grain properties using ourmeasurement of the temperature. We find that in all cases considered the valuesare significantly larger than the dust response time measured by IR photometricmonitoring campaigns, with the least discrepancy present relative to the resultfor a wavelength-independent dust emissivity law, i.e. a blackbody, which isappropriate for large grain sizes. This result can be well explained byassuming a flared, disk-like structure for the hot dust.|

|**Abstract**| We present the ultraviolet luminosity function and an estimate of the cosmicstar formation rate density at $8<z<13$ derived from deep NIRCam observationstaken in parallel with the MIRI Deep Survey (MDS) of the Hubble Ultra DeepField (HUDF), NIRCam covering the parallel field 2 (HUDF-P2). Our deep(40~hours) NIRCam observations reach a $F277W$ magnitude of 30.8 at the$5\sigma$ level, more than 2 magnitudes deeper than JWST public datasetsalready analyzed to find high redshift galaxies. We select a sample of 45 $z>8$galaxy candidates based on their dropout nature in the $F115W$ and/or $F150W$filters, a high probability for their photometric redshifts, estimated withthree different codes, being at $z>8$, good fits based on $\chi^2$calculations, and predominant solutions compared to $z<8$ alternatives. We findmild evolution in the luminosity function from $z\sim13$ to $z\sim8$, i.e.,only a small increase in the average number density of $\sim$0.2~dex, while thefaint-end slope and absolute magnitude of the knee remain approximatelyconstant, with values $\alpha=-2.3\pm0.2$ and $M^*=-20.8\pm0.2$~mag. Comparingour results with the predictions of a wide range of state-of-the-art galaxyevolution models, we find two main results: (1) a slower increase with time inthe cosmic star formation rate density compared to a steeper rise predicted bymodels; (2) nearly a factor of 10 higher star formation activity concentratedin scales around 2~kpc in galaxies with stellar masses $\sim10^8$~M$_\odot$during the first 350~Myr of the Universe ($z\sim12$), with models matchingbetter the observations $\sim$150~Myr later, by $z\sim9$.|

|**Abstract**| We derive and publish data-driven estimates of stellar metallicities [M/H]for ~120 million stars with low-resolution XP spectra published in Gaia DR3.The [M/H] values, along with Teff and logg, are derived using the XGBoostalgorithm, trained on stellar parameters from APOGEE, augmented by a set ofvery metal-poor stars. XGBoost draws on a number of data features: the full setof XP spectral coefficients, narrowband fluxes derived from XP spectra, andbroadband magnitudes. In particular, we include AllWISE magnitudes, as theyreduce the degeneracy of Teff and dust reddening. We also include the parallaxas a data feature, which helps constrain logg and [M/H]. The resulting meanstellar parameter precision is 0.1dex in [M/H], 50K in Teff, and 0.08dex inlogg. This all-sky [M/H] sample is two orders of magnitude larger thanpublished samples of comparable fidelity across -3<[M/H]<+0.5. Additionally, weprovide a catalog of over 13 million bright (G<16) red giants whose [M/H] arevetted to be precise and pure. We present all-sky maps of the Milky Way indifferent [M/H] regimes that illustrate the purity of the dataset, anddemonstrate the power of this unprecedented sample to reveal the Milky Way'sstructure from its heart to its disk.|

|**Abstract**| We use new HCN(1-0) data from the ALMOND (ACA Large-sample Mapping Of Nearbygalaxies in Dense gas) survey to trace the kpc-scale molecular gas densitystructure and CO(2-1) data from PHANGS-ALMA to trace the bulk molecular gasacross 25 nearby, star-forming galaxies. At 2.1 kpc scale, we measure thedensity-sensitive HCN/CO line ratio and the SFR/HCN ratio to trace the starformation efficiency in the denser molecular medium. At 150 pc scale, wemeasure structural and dynamical properties of the molecular gas via CO(2-1)line emission, which is linked to the lower resolution data using anintensity-weighted averaging method. We find positive correlations (negative)of HCN/CO (SFR/HCN) with the surface density, the velocity dispersion and theinternal turbulent pressure of the molecular gas. These observed correlationsagree with expected trends from turbulent models of star formation, whichconsider a single free-fall time gravitational collapse. Our results show thatthe kpc-scale HCN/CO line ratio is a powerful tool to trace the 150 pc scaleaverage density distribution of the molecular clouds. Lastly, we findsystematic variations of the SFR/HCN ratio with cloud-scale molecular gasproperties, which are incompatible with a universal star formation efficiency.Overall, these findings show that mean molecular gas density, molecular cloudproperties and star formation are closely linked in a coherent way, andobservations of density-sensitive molecular gas tracers are a useful tool toanalyse these variations, linking molecular gas physics to stellar outputacross galaxy discs.|

|**Abstract**| Star formation and stellar feedback are interlinked processes thatredistribute energy and matter throughout galaxies. When young, massive starsform in spatially clustered environments, they create pockets of expanding gastermed superbubbles. As these processes play a critical role in shaping galaxydiscs and regulating the baryon cycle, measuring the properties of superbubblesprovides important input for galaxy evolution models. With wide coverage andhigh angular resolution ($\sim$50-150 pc) of the PHANGS-ALMA $^{12}$CO (2-1)survey, we can now resolve and identify a statistically representative numberof superbubbles with molecular gas in nearby galaxies. We identify superbubblesby requiring spatial correspondence between shells in CO with stellarpopulations identified in PHANGS-HST, and combine the properties of the stellarpopulations with CO to constrain feedback models and quantify their energetics.We visually identify 325 cavities across 18 PHANGS-ALMA galaxies, 88 of whichhave clear superbubble signatures (unbroken shells, central clusters, kinematicsignatures of expansion). We measure their radii and expansion velocities usingCO to dynamically derive their ages and the mechanical power driving thebubbles, which we use to compute the expected properties of the parent stellarpopulations driving the bubbles. We find consistency between the predicted andderived stellar ages and masses of the stellar populations if we use asupernova (SN) model that injects energy with a coupling efficiency of 5-12%,whereas wind models fail to explain stellar ages we measure. Not only does thisconfirm molecular gas accurately traces superbubble properties, but it alsoprovides key observational constraints for superbubble models. We also findevidence that the bubbles are sweeping up gas as they expand and speculate thatthese sites have the potential to host new generations of stars.|

|**Abstract**| Methanol is the most complex molecule securely identified in interstellarices and is a key chemical species for understanding chemical complexity inastrophysical environments. Important aspects of the methanol icephotochemistry are still unclear such as the branching ratios andphoto-dissociation cross-sections at different temperatures and irradiationfluxes. This work aims at a quantitative agreement between laboratoryexperiments and astrochemical modelling of the CH3OH ice UV photolysis. Thiswork also allows us to better understand which processes govern the methanolice photochemistry present in laboratory experiments. We use ProDiMo tosimulate the conditions of laboratory measurements. The simulations start withsimple chemistry consisting only of methanol ice and helium to mimic theresidual gas in the experimental chamber. A surface chemical network enlargedby photo-dissociation reactions is used to study the chemical reactions withinthe ice. Additionally, different surface chemistry parameters (surfacecompetition, tunnelling, thermal diffusion and reactive desorption) are adoptedto check those that reproduce the experimental results. The chemical modelswith ProDiMo can reproduce the methanol ice destruction via UVphotodissociation at temperatures of 20, 30, 50 and 70 K as observed in theexperiments. We note that the results are sensitive to different branchingratios after photolysis and to the mechanisms of reactive desorption. In thesimulations of a molecular cloud at 20 K, we observed an increase in themethanol gas abundance of one order of magnitude, with a similar decrease inthe solid-phase abundance. Comprehensive astrochemical models provide newinsights into laboratory experiments as the quantitative understanding of theprocesses that govern the reactions within the ice. Ultimately, those insightscan help to better interpret astronomical observations.|

|**Abstract**| This work considers which higher-order effects in modelling the cosmic shearangular power spectra must be taken into account for Euclid. We identify whichterms are of concern, and quantify their individual and cumulative impact oncosmological parameter inference from Euclid. We compute the values of thesehigher-order effects using analytic expressions, and calculate the impact oncosmological parameter estimation using the Fisher matrix formalism. We review24 effects and find the following potentially need to be accounted for: thereduced shear approximation, magnification bias, source-lens clustering, sourceobscuration, local Universe effects, and the flat Universe assumption. Uponcomputing these explicitly, and calculating their cosmological parameterbiases, using a maximum multipole of $\ell=5000$, we find that themagnification bias, source-lens clustering, source obscuration, and localUniverse terms individually produce significant ($\,>0.25\sigma$) cosmologicalbiases in one or more parameters, and accordingly must be accounted for. Intotal, over all effects, we find biases in $\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\Omega_{\rm b}$,$h$, and $\sigma_{8}$ of $0.73\sigma$, $0.28\sigma$, $0.25\sigma$, and$-0.79\sigma$, respectively, for flat $\Lambda$CDM. For the $w_0w_a$CDM case,we find biases in $\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\Omega_{\rm b}$, $h$, $n_{\rm s}$,$\sigma_{8}$, and $w_a$ of $1.49\sigma$, $0.35\sigma$, $-1.36\sigma$,$1.31\sigma$, $-0.84\sigma$, and $-0.35\sigma$, respectively; which areincreased relative to the $\Lambda$CDM due to additional degeneracies as afunction of redshift and scale.|

|**Abstract**| TOI-2525 is a K-type star with an estimated mass of M =0.849$_{-0.033}^{+0.024}$ M$_\odot$ and radius of R = 0.785$_{-0.007}^{+0.007}$R$_\odot$ observed by the TESS mission in 22 sectors (within sectors 1 and 39).The TESS light curves yield significant transit events of two companions, whichshow strong transit timing variations (TTVs) with a semi-amplitude of a $\sim$6hours. We performed TTV dynamical, and photo-dynamical light curve analysis ofthe TESS data, combined with radial velocity (RV) measurements from FEROS andPFS, and we confirmed the planetary nature of these companions. The TOI-2525system consists of a transiting pair of planets comparable to Neptune andJupiter with estimated dynamical masses of $m_{\rm b}$ =0.088$_{-0.004}^{+0.005}$ M$_{\rm Jup.}$, and $m_{\rm c}$ =0.709$_{-0.033}^{+0.034}$ M$_{\rm Jup.}$, radius of $r_b$ =0.88$_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$ R$_{\rm Jup.}$ and $r_c$ = 0.98$_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$R$_{\rm Jup.}$, and with orbital periods of $P_{\rm b}$ =23.288$_{-0.002}^{+0.001}$ days and $P_{\rm c}$ = 49.260$_{-0.001}^{+0.001}$days for the inner and the outer planet, respectively. The period ratio isclose to the 2:1 period commensurability, but the dynamical simulations of thesystem suggest that it is outside the mean motion resonance (MMR) dynamicalconfiguration. TOI-2525 b is among the lowest density Neptune-mass planetsknown to date, with an estimated median density of $\rho_{\rm b}$ =0.174$_{-0.015}^{+0.016}$ g\,cm$^{-3}$. The TOI-2525 system is very similar tothe other K-dwarf systems discovered by TESS, TOI-2202 and TOI-216, which arecomposed of almost identical K-dwarf primary and two warm giant planets nearthe 2:1 MMR.|

|**Abstract**| Debris disks are the signposts of collisionally eroding planetesimalcircumstellar belts, whose study can put important constraints on the structureof extrasolar planetary systems. The best constraints on the morphology ofdisks are often obtained from spatially resolved observations in scatteredlight. Here, we investigate the young (~16 Myr) bright gas-rich debris diskaround HD121617. We use new scattered-light observations with VLT/SPHERE tocharacterize the morphology and the dust properties of this disk. From theseproperties we can then derive constraints on the physical and dynamicalenvironment of this system, for which significant amounts of gas have beendetected. The disk morphology is constrained by linear-polarimetricobservations in the J band. Based on our modeling results and archivalphotometry, we also model the SED to put constraints on the total dust mass andthe dust size distribution. We explore different scenarios that could explainthese new constraints. We present the first resolved image in scattered lightof the debris disk HD121617. We fit the morphology of the disk, finding asemi-major axis of 78.3$\pm$0.2 au, an inclination of 43.1$\pm$0.2Â° and aposition angle of the major axis with respect to north, of 239.8$\pm$0.3Â°,compatible with the previous continuum and CO detection with ALMA. Our analysisshows that the disk has a very sharp inner edge, possibly sculpted by ayet-undetected planet or gas drag. While less sharp, its outer edge is steeperthan expected for unperturbed disks, which could also be due to a planet or gasdrag, but future observations probing the system farther from the main beltwould help explore this further. The SED analysis leads to a dust mass of0.21$\pm$0.02 M$_{\oplus}$ and a minimum grain size of 0.87$\pm$0.12 $\mu$m,smaller than the blowout size by radiation pressure, which is not unexpectedfor very bright col...|

|**Abstract**| We present JWST NIRCam 9-band near-infrared imaging of the luminous $z=10.6$galaxy GN-z11 from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) of theGOODS-N field. We find a spectral energy distribution (SED) entirely consistentwith the expected form of a high-redshift galaxy: a clear blue continuum from1.5 to 4 microns with a complete dropout in F115W. The core of GN-z11 isextremely compact in JWST imaging. We analyze the image with a two-componentmodel, using a point source and a SÃ©rsic profile that fits to a half-lightradius of 200 pc and an index $n=0.9$. We find a low-surface brightness hazeabout $0.4''$ to the northeast of the galaxy, which is most likely a foregroundobject but might be a more extended component of GN-z11. At a spectroscopicredshift of 10.60 (Bunker et al. 2023), the comparison of the NIRCam F410M andF444W images spans the Balmer jump. From population synthesis modeling, hereassuming no light from an active galactic nucleus, we reproduce the SED ofGN-z11, finding a stellar mass of $\sim$$10^{9}~M_{\odot}$, a star-formationrate of $\sim$$20~M_{\odot}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and a young stellar age of$\sim$$20~\mathrm{Myr}$. As massive galaxies at high redshift are likely to behighly clustered, we search for faint neighbors of GN-z11, finding 9 galaxiesout to $\sim$5 comoving Mpc transverse with photometric redshifts consistentwith $z=10.6$, and a 10$^{\rm th}$ more tentative dropout only $3''$ away.|

|**Abstract**| We present JADES JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of GN-z11, the most luminouscandidate $z>10$ Lyman break galaxy in the GOODS-North field with$M_{UV}=-21.5$. We derive a redshift of $z=10.603$ (lower than previousdeterminations) based on multiple emission lines in our low and mediumresolution spectra over $0.8-5.3\,\mu$m. We significantly detect the continuumand measure a blue rest-UV spectral slope of $\beta=-2.4$. Remarkably, we seespatially-extended Lyman-$\alpha$ in emission (despite the highly-neutral IGMexpected at this early epoch), offset 555 km/s redward of the systemicredshift. From our measurements of collisionally-excited lines of both low- andhigh-ionization (including [O II] $\lambda3727$, [Ne III] $\lambda 3869$ and CIII] $\lambda1909$) we infer a high ionization parameter ($\log U\sim -2$). Wedetect the rarely-seen N IV] $\lambda1486$ and N III]$\lambda1748$ lines inboth our low and medium resolution spectra, with other high ionization linesseen in low resolution spectrum such as He II (blended with O III]) and C IV(with a possible P-Cygni profile). Based on the observed rest-UV line ratios,we cannot conclusively rule out photoionization from AGN. The high C III]/He IIratios, however, suggest a likely star-formation explanation. If the observedemission lines are powered by star formation, then the strong N III]$\lambda1748$ observed may imply an unusually high $N/O$ abundance. Balmeremission lines (H$\gamma$, H$\delta$) are also detected, and if powered by starformation rather than an AGN we infer a star formation rate of $\sim 20-30M_{\odot}\,\rm yr^{-1}$ (depending on the IMF) and low dust attenuation. OurNIRSpec spectroscopy confirms that GN-z11 is a remarkable galaxy with extremeproperties seen 430 Myr after the Big Bang.|

|**Abstract**| Visual inspections of the first optical rest-frame images from JWST haveindicated a surprisingly high fraction of disk galaxies at high redshifts. Herewe alternatively apply self-supervised machine learning to explore themorphological diversity at $z \geq 3$. Our proposed data-driven representationscheme of galaxy morphologies, calibrated on mock images from the TNG50simulation, is shown to be robust to noise and to correlate well with physicalproperties of the simulated galaxies, including their 3D structure. We applythe method simultaneously to F200W and F356W galaxy images of a mass-completesample ($M_*/M_\odot>10^9$) at $z \geq 3$ from the first JWST/NIRCam CEERS datarelease. We find that the simulated and observed galaxies do not populate thesame manifold in the representation space from contrastive learning, partlybecause the observed galaxies tend to be more compact and more elongated thanthe simulated galaxies. We also find that about half the galaxies that werevisually classified as disks based on their elongated images actually populatea similar region of the representation space than spheroids, which according tothe TNG50 simulation is occupied by objects with low stellar specific angularmomentum and non-oblate structure. This suggests that the disk fraction at $z >3$ as evaluated by visual classification may be severely overestimated bymisclassifying compact, elongated galaxies as disks. Deeper imaging and/orspectroscopic follow-ups as well as comparisons with other simulations willhelp to unambiguously determine the true nature of these galaxies.|

|**Abstract**| We report the analysis of microlensing event OGLE-2017-BLG-1038, observed bythe Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, Korean Microlensing TelescopeNetwork, and Spitzer telescopes. The event is caused by a giant source star inthe Galactic Bulge passing over a large resonant binary lens caustic. Theavailability of space-based data allows the full set of physical parameters tobe calculated. However, there exists an eightfold degeneracy in the parallaxmeasurement. The four best solutions correspond to very-low-mass binaries near($M_1 = 170^{+40}_{-50} M_J$ and $M_2 = 110^{+20}_{-30} M_J$), or well below($M_1 = 22.5^{+0.7}_{-0.4} M_J$ and $M_2 = 13.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3} M_J$) theboundary between stars and brown dwarfs. A conventional analysis, with scaleduncertainties for Spitzer data, implies a very-low-mass brown dwarf binary lensat a distance of 2 kpc. Compensating for systematic Spitzer errors using aGaussian process model suggests that a higher mass M-dwarf binary at 6 kpc isequally likely. A Bayesian comparison based on a galactic model favors thelarger-mass solutions. We demonstrate how this degeneracy can be resolvedwithin the next ten years through infrared adaptive-optics imaging with a 40 mclass telescope.|

|**Abstract**| We report spectroscopic and photometric follow-up of a dormant black hole(BH) candidate from Gaia DR3. The system, which we call Gaia BH2, contains a$\sim 1M_{\odot}$ red giant and a dark companion with mass $M_2 = 8.9\pm0.3\,M_{\odot}$ that is very likely a BH. The orbital period, $P_{\rm orb} =1277$ days, is much longer than that of any previously studied BH binary. Ourradial velocity (RV) follow-up over a 7-month period spans more than 90% of theorbit's dynamic range in RV and is in excellent agreement with predictions ofthe Gaia solution. UV imaging and high-resolution optical spectra rule out allplausible luminous companions that could explain the orbit. The star is abright ($G=12.3$), slightly metal-poor ($\rm [Fe/H]=-0.22$) low-luminositygiant ($T_{\rm eff}=4600\,\rm K$; $R = 7.8\,R_{\odot}$; $\log\left[g/\left({\rmcm\,s^{-2}}\right)\right] = 2.6$). The binary's orbit is moderately eccentric($e=0.52$). The giant is strongly enhanced in $\alpha-$elements, with $\rm[\alpha/Fe] = +0.26$, but the system's Galactocentric orbit is typical of thethin disk. We obtained X-ray and radio nondetections of the source nearperiastron, which support BH accretion models in which the net accretion rateat the horizon is much lower than the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton rate. At a distanceof 1.16 kpc, Gaia BH2 is the second-nearest known BH, after Gaia BH1. Its orbit-- like that of Gaia BH1 -- seems too wide to have formed through commonenvelope evolution. Gaia BH1 and BH2 have orbital periods at opposite edges ofthe Gaia DR3 sensitivity curve, perhaps hinting at a bimodal intrinsic perioddistribution for wide BH binaries. Dormant BH binaries like Gaia BH1 and GaiaBH2 likely significantly outnumber their close, X-ray bright cousins, but theirformation pathways remain uncertain.|

|**Abstract**| Radial velocities (RVs) measured from high-resolution stellar spectra areroutinely used to detect and characterise orbiting exoplanet companions. Thedifferent lines present in stellar spectra are created by several species,which are non-uniformly affected by stellar variability features such as spotsor faculae. Stellar variability distorts the shape of the spectral absorptionlines from which precise RVs are measured, posing one of the main problems inthe study of exoplanets. In this work we aim to study how the spectral linespresent in M dwarfs are independently impacted by stellar activity. We usedCARMENES optical spectra of six active early- and mid-type M dwarfs to computeline-by-line RVs and study their correlation with several well-studied proxiesof stellar activity. We are able to classify spectral lines based on theirsensitivity to activity in five M dwarfs displaying high levels of stellaractivity. We further used this line classification to compute RVs withactivity-sensitive lines and less sensitive lines, enhancing or mitigatingstellar activity effects in the RV time series. For specific sets of the leastactivity-sensitive lines, the RV scatter decreases by ~ 2 to 5 times theinitial one, depending on the star. Finally, we compare these lines in thedifferent stars analysed, finding the sensitivity to activity to vary from starto star. Despite the high density of lines and blends present in M dwarfstellar spectra, we find that a line-by-line approach is able to deliverprecise RVs. Line-by-line RVs are also sensitive to stellar activity effects,and they allow for an accurate selection of activity-insensitive lines tomitigate activity effects in RV. However, we find stellar activity effects tovary in the same insensitive lines from star to star.|

|**Abstract**| The diffusion of molecules on interstellar grain surfaces is one of the mostimportant driving forces for the molecular complexity in the interstellarmedium. Due to the lack of laboratory measurements, astrochemical modeling ofgrain surface processes usually assumes a constant ratio between the diffusionenergy barrier and the desorption energy. This over-simplification inevitablycauses large uncertainty in model predictions. We present a new measurement ofthe diffusion of CO$_2$ molecules on the surface of non-porous amorphous solidwater (np-ASW), an analog of the ice mantle that covers cosmic dust grains. Asmall coverage of CO$_2$ was deposited onto an np-ASW surface at 40~K, thesubsequent warming of the ice activated the diffusion of CO$_2$ molecules, anda transition from isolated CO$_2$ to CO$_2$ clusters was seen in the infraredspectra. To obtain the diffusion energy barrier and pre-exponential factorsimultaneously, a set of isothermal experiments were carried out. The valuesfor the diffusion energy barrier and pre-exponential factor were found to be$1300\pm110$~K and $10^{7.6\pm0.8}$~s$^{-1}$. A comparison with priorlaboratory measurements on diffusion is discussed.|

|**Abstract**| We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) transit observations of theHot-Jupiter WASP-79b acquired with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph(STIS) in the near ultraviolet (NUV). Two transit observations, part of thePanCET program, are used to obtain the transmission spectra of the planetbetween 2280 and 3070Ã. We correct for systematic effects in the raw datausing the jitter engineering parameters and polynomial modelling to fit thewhite light curves of the two transits. We observe an increase in theplanet-to-star radius ratio at short wavelengths, but no spectrally resolvedabsorption lines. The difference between the radius ratios at 2400 and3000Ã reaches $0.0191\pm0.0042$ ($\sim$4.5$-\sigma$). Although the NUVtransmission spectrum does not show evidence of hydrodynamical escape, thestrong atmospheric features are likely due to species at very high altitudes.We performed a 1D simulation of the temperature and composition of WASP-79busing Exo-REM. The temperature pressure profile crosses condensation curves ofradiatively active clouds, particularly MnS, Mg$_2$SiO$_4$, Fe, andAl$_2$O$_3$. Still, none of these species produces the level of observedabsorption at short wavelengths and can explain the observed increase in theplanet's radius. WASP-79b's transit depth reaches 23 scale height, making itone of the largest spectral features observed in an exoplanet at thistemperature ($\sim$1700 K). The comparison of WASP-79b's transmission spectrumwith three warmer hot Jupiters shows a similar level of absorption to WASP-178band WASP-121b between 0.2 and 0.3$\mu$m, while HAT-P-41b's spectrum is flat.The features could be explained by SiO absorption.|

|**Abstract**| The CARMENES instrument was conceived to deliver high-accuracy radialvelocity (RV) measurements with long-term stability to search for temperaterocky planets around a sample of nearby cool stars. The broad wavelengthcoverage was designed to provide a range of stellar activity indicators toassess the nature of potential RV signals and to provide valuable spectralinformation to help characterise the stellar targets. The CARMENES Data Release1 (DR1) makes public all observations obtained during the CARMENES guaranteedtime observations, which ran from 2016 to 2020 and collected 19,633 spectra fora sample of 362 targets. The CARMENES survey target selection was aimed atminimising biases, and about 70% of all known M dwarfs within 10 pc andaccessible from Calar Alto were included. The data were pipeline-processed, andhigh-level data products, including 18,642 precise RVs for 345 targets, werederived. Time series data of spectroscopic activity indicators were alsoobtained. We discuss the characteristics of the CARMENES data, the statisticalproperties of the stellar sample, and the spectroscopic measurements. We showexamples of the use of CARMENES data and provide a contextual view of theexoplanet population revealed by the survey, including 33 new planets, 17re-analysed planets, and 26 confirmed planets from transiting candidatefollow-up. A subsample of 238 targets was used to derive updated planetoccurrence rates, yielding an overall average of 1.44+/-0.20 planets with 1M_Earth < M sin i < 1000 M_Earth and 1 d < P_orb < 1000 d per star, andindicating that nearly every M dwarf hosts at least one planet. CARMENES datahave proven very useful for identifying and measuring planetary companions aswell as for additional applications, such as the determination of stellarproperties, the characterisation of stellar activity, and the study ofexoplanet atmospheres.|

|**Abstract**| We investigate the formation of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in theTNG300 cosmological simulation of the IllustrisTNG project. Our cluster sampleconsists of 700 haloes with $M_{200} \geq 5 \times 10^{13} \,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ at $z=0$, along with their progenitors at earlier epochs.This includes 280 systems with $M_{200} \geq 10^{14} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ at$z=0$, as well as three haloes with $M_{200} \geq 10^{15} \,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We find that the stellar masses and star formation ratesof our simulated BCGs are in good agreement with observations at $z \lesssim0.4$, and that they have experienced, on average, $\sim$2 ($\sim$3) majormergers since $z=1$ ($z=2$). Separating the BCG from the intracluster light(ICL) by means of a fixed 30 kpc aperture, we find that the fraction of stellarmass contributed by ex situ (i.e. accreted) stars at $z=0$ is approximately 70,80, and 90 per cent for the BCG, BCG+ICL, and ICL, respectively. Tracking oursimulated BCGs back in time using the merger trees, we find that they becamedominated by ex situ stars at $z \sim $1-2, and that half of the stars that arepart of the BCG at $z=0$ formed early ($z \sim 3$) in other galaxies, but`assembled' onto the BCG until later times ($z \approx 0.8$ for the wholesample, $z \approx 0.5$ for BCGs in $M_{200} \geq 5 \times 10^{14} \,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ haloes). Finally, we show that the stellar mass profiles ofBCGs are often dominated by ex situ stars at all radii, with stars from majormergers being found closer to the centre, while stars that were tidallystripped from other galaxies dominate the outer regions.|

|**Abstract**| We report the discovery of a remarkable Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxy at$z=7.278$, JADES-GS+53.16746-27.7720 (shortened to JADES-GS-z7-LA), withEW$_0$(Ly$\alpha$) $\approx400 \pm 90$A and UV magnitude $-16.7$. Thespectroscopic redshift is confirmed via rest-frame optical lines [O II],H$\beta$ and [O III] in its JWST/NIRSpec Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) spectrum.The Ly$\alpha$ line is detected in both lower resolution ($R\sim100$) PRISM aswell as medium resolution ($R\sim1000$) G140M grating spectra. The Ly$\alpha$FWHM in the grating is $\approx360$ km s$^{-1}$ and the line peaks within $120$km s$^{-1}$ of the systemic redshift, indicative of very little neutral gas ordust within the galaxy. We estimate the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction to be$\sim100\%$. JADES-GS-z7-LA has a [O III]/[O II] ratio (O32) of $8.8 \pm 1.1$and ([O III]+[O II])/H$\beta$ ratio (R23) of $9.6\pm2.2$, consistent with lowmetallicity and high ionization parameters. Deep NIRCam imaging also revealed aclose companion source (separated by $0.23''$), which exhibits similarphotometry to that of JADES-GS-z7-LA, with a photometric excess in the F410MNIRCam image consistent with [O III]+H$\beta$ emission at the same redshift.The spectral energy distribution of JADES-GS-z7-LA indicates a `bursty'star-formation history, with a low stellar mass of $10^{7.15}$ M$_\odot$. Theonly explanation of the high EW Ly$\alpha$ emission seen in JADES-GS-z7-LA isif it resides in an ionized bubble with radius $\gtrsim 3$ pMpc. Owing to thefaint nature of JADES-GS-z7-LA, we show that it is incapable of single-handedlyionizing a bubble large enough. Therefore, we suggest that JADES-GS-z7-LA (andpossibly the companion source) may be a part of a larger overdensity,presenting direct evidence of overlapping ionized bubbles at $z>7$, allowing usto study the process of reionization across both small and large scales.|

|**Abstract**| Planetary population synthesis is a tool to understand the physics ofplanetary system formation. It builds on a model that includes a multitude ofphysical processes. The outcome can be statistically compared with exoplanetobservations. Here, we review the population synthesis method and then use onepopulation to explore how different planetary system architectures emerge andwhich conditions lead to their formation. The systems can be classified intofour main architectures: Class I of near-in situ compositionally orderedterrestrial and ice planets, Class II of migrated sub-Neptunes, Class III ofmixed low-mass and giant planets, broadly similar to the Solar System, andClass IV of dynamically active giants without inner low-mass planets. Thesefour classes exhibit distinct typical formation pathways and are characterisedby certain mass scales. Class I systems form from the local accretion ofplanetesimals followed by a giant impact phase, and the final planet massescorrespond to the `Goldreich mass'. Class II systems form when planets reachthe `equality mass' (equal accretion and migration timescales) before thedispersal of the gas disc, but not large enough to allow for rapid gasaccretion. Giant planets form when the `equality mass' allows for rapid gasaccretion while the planet are migrating, i.e. when the critical core mass isreached. The main discriminant of the four classes is the initial mass ofsolids in the disc, with contributions from the lifetime and mass of the gasdisc. The breakdown into classes allows to better understand which physicalprocesses are dominant. Comparison with observations reveals certaindifferences to the actual population, pointing at limitation of theoreticalunderstanding. For example, the overrepresentation of synthetic super Earthsand sub-Neptunes in Class I causes these planets to be found at lowermetallicities than in observations.|

|**Abstract**| The Hydra I cluster offers an excellent opportunity to study and compare therelic old stellar populations in the core of its two brightest galaxies. Inaddition, the differing kinematics of the two galaxies allows a test of thelocal validity of general scaling relations. In this work we present a directcomparison employing full spectral fitting of new high-quality long-slitoptical and NIR spectroscopic data. We retrieve age, metallicity and 19elemental abundances out to about 12 kpc within each galaxy, as well as the IMFin their central regions. Our results suggest that the inner 5 kpc region ofboth galaxies, despite their different masses, formed at the same time andevolved with a similar star formation time-scale and chemical enrichment,confirming their early formation in the cluster build up. Only the overallmetallicity and IMF radial profiles show differences connected with theirdifferent velocity dispersion profiles. The radial trend of the IMF positivelycorrelates with both [Z/H] and velocity dispersion. While the trends of the IMFwith metallicity agree with a global trend for both galaxies, the trends withthe velocity dispersion exhibit differences. The outer regions show signs ofmixed stellar populations with large differences in chemical content comparedto the centers, but with similar old ages.|

|**Abstract**| We develop, validate and apply a forward model to estimate stellaratmospheric parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$, $\log{g}$ and $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$),revised distances and extinctions for 220 million stars with XP spectra from$\textit{Gaia}$ DR3. Instead of using $\textit{ab initio}$ stellar models, wedevelop a data-driven model of $\textit{Gaia}$ XP spectra as a function of thestellar parameters, with a few straightforward built-in physical assumptions.We train our model on stellar atmospheric parameters from the LAMOST survey,which provides broad coverage of different spectral types. We model the$\textit{Gaia}$ XP spectra with all of their covariances, augmented by 2MASSand WISE photometry that greatly reduces degeneracies between stellarparameters, yielding more precise determinations of temperature and dustreddening. Taken together, our approach overcomes a number of importantlimitations that the astrophysical parameters released in $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3faced, and exploits the full information content of the data. We provide theresulting catalog of stellar atmospheric parameters, revised parallaxes andextinction estimates, with all their uncertainties. The modeling procedure alsoproduces an estimate of the optical extinction curve at the spectral resolutionof the XP spectra ($R \sim 20-100$), which agrees reasonably well with the${R(V) = 3.1}$ CCM model. Remaining limitations that will be addressed infuture work are that the model assumes a universal extinction law, ignoresbinary stars and does not cover all parts of the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram($\textit{e.g.}$, white dwarfs).|

|**Abstract**| In the Milky Way the central massive black hole, SgrA*, coexists with acompact nuclear star cluster that contains a sub-parsec concentration offast-moving young stars called S-stars. Their location and age are not easilyexplained by current star formation models, and in several scenarios thepresence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) has been invoked. We useGRAVITY astrometric and SINFONI, KECK, and GNIRS spectroscopic data of S2 toinvestigate whether a second massive object could be present deep in theGalactic Centre (GC) in the form of an IMBH binary companion to SgrA*. To solvethe three-body problem, we used a post-Newtonian framework and consider twotypes of settings: (i) a hierarchical set-up where the star S2 orbits the SgrA*- IMBH binary and (ii) a non-hierarchical set-up where the IMBH trajectory liesoutside the S2 orbit. In both cases we explore the full 20-dimensionalparameter space by employing a Bayesian dynamic nested sampling method. For thehierarchical case we find: IMBH masses > 2000 Msun on orbits with smallersemi-major axes than S2 are largely excluded. For the non-hierarchical case theparameter space contains several pockets of valid IMBH solutions. However, acloser analysis of their impact on the resident stars reveals that IMBHs onsemi-major axes larger than S2 tend to disrupt the S-star cluster in less thana million years. This makes the existence of an IMBH among the S-stars highlyunlikely. The current S2 data do not formally require the presence of an IMBH.If an IMBH hides in the GC, it has to be either a low-mass IMBH inside the S2orbit that moves on a short and significantly inclined trajectory or an IMBHwith a semi-major axis >1". We provide the parameter maps of valid IMBHsolutions in the GC and discuss the general structure of our results.(abridged)|

|**Abstract**| The Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) initiative aims to develop aspace based mid-infrared (MIR) nulling interferometer to measure the thermalemission spectra of temperate terrestrial exoplanets.We investigate how well LIFE could characterize a cloudy Venus-twin exoplanetto: (1) test our retrieval routine on a realistic non-Earth-like MIR spectrumof a known planet, (2) investigate how clouds impact retrievals, (3) refine theLIFE requirements derived in previous Earth-centered studies.We run retrievals for simulated LIFE observations of a Venus-twin exoplanetorbiting a Sun-like star located 10 pc from the observer. By assuming differentmodels (cloudy and cloud-free) we analyze the performance as a function of thequality of the LIFE observation. This allows us to determine how wellatmosphere and clouds are characterizable depending on the quality of thespectrum.Our study shows that the current minimal resolution ($R=50$) andsignal-to-noise ($S/N=10$ at $11.2\mu$m) requirements for LIFE suffice tocharacterize the structure and composition of a Venus-like atmosphere above thecloud deck if an adequate model is chosen. However, we cannot infer cloudproperties. The accuracy of the retrieved planet radius ($R_{pl}$), equilibriumtemperature ($T_{eq}$), and Bond albedo ($A_B$) depend on the choice of model.Generally, a cloud-free model performs best and thus the presence of cloudscannot be inferred. This model dependence of retrieval results emphasizes theimportance of developing a community-wide best-practice for atmosphericretrieval studies. If we consider higher quality spectra (especially $S/N=20$),we can infer the presence of clouds and pose first constraints on theirstructure.|

|**Abstract**| The spin-orbit obliquity of a planetary system constraints its formationhistory. A large obliquity may either indicate a primordial misalignmentbetween the star and its gaseous disk or reflect the effect of differentmechanisms tilting planetary systems after formation. Observations andstatistical analysis suggest that system of planets with sizes between 1 and 4R$_{\oplus}$ have a wide range of obliquities ($\sim0-30^{\circ}$), and thatsingle- and multi-planet transiting have statistically indistinguishableobliquity distributions. Here, we revisit the ``breaking the chains'' formationmodel with focus in understanding the origin of spin-orbit obliquities. Thismodel suggests that super-Earths and mini-Neptunes migrate close to their hoststars via planet-disk gravitational interactions, forming chain of planetslocked in mean-motion resonances. After gas-disk dispersal, about 90-99\% ofthese planetary systems experience dynamical instabilities, which spread thesystems out. Using synthetic transit observations, we show that if planets areborn in disks where the disk angular momentum is virtually aligned with thestar's rotation spin, their final obliquity distributions peak at about $\sim$5degrees or less, and the obliquity distributions of single and multi-planettransiting systems are statistically distinct. By treating the star-diskalignment as a free-parameter, we show that the obliquity distributions ofsingle and multi-planet transiting systems only become statisticallyindistinguishable if planets are assumed to form in primordially misalignednatal disks with a ``tilt'' distribution peaking at $\gtrsim$10-20 deg. Wediscuss the origin of these misalignments in the context of star formation andpotential implications of this scenario for formation models.|

|**Abstract**| The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) has presented first -dynamic-range limited - images of the black hole shadows in M87 and Sgr A*. Thenext generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) will provide higher sensitivityand higher dynamic range images (and movies) of these two sources plus image atleast a dozen others at $\leq$100 gravitational radii resolution. We hereperform an exploratory study of the appearance of winds and jets in such futureobservations. To do this we use M87 and Sgr A* as reference systems: we do notaim to exactly reproduce them, but rather to determine how their observedimages will depend on specific physical assumptions. Even in the case ofsimilar or the same dynamics, the images depend significantly on globalparameters such as the black hole mass and the mass accretion rate. Our resultsprovide guidance in the interpretation of future high-resolution images,particularly if a wind or jet is detected.|

|**Abstract**| VISIONS is an ESO public survey of five nearby (d < 500 pc) star-formingmolecular cloud complexes that are canonically associated with theconstellations of Chamaeleon, Corona Australis, Lupus, Ophiuchus, and Orion.The survey was carried out with VISTA, using VIRCAM, and collected data in thenear-infrared passbands J, H, and Ks. With a total on-sky exposure time of 49.4h VISIONS covers an area of 650 deg$^2$, and it was designed to build aninfrared legacy archive similar to that of 2MASS. Taking place between April2017 and March 2022, the observations yielded approximately 1.15 millionimages, which comprise 19 TB of raw data. The observations are grouped intothree different subsurveys: The wide subsurvey comprises shallow, large-scaleobservations and has visited the star-forming complexes six times over thecourse of its execution. The deep subsurvey of dedicated high-sensitivityobservations has collected data on the areas with the largest amounts of dustextinction. The control subsurvey includes observations of areas oflow-to-negligible dust extinction. Using this strategy, the VISIONS surveyoffers multi-epoch position measurements, is able to access deeply embeddedobjects, and provides a baseline for statistical comparisons and samplecompleteness. In particular, VISIONS is designed to measure the proper motionsof point sources with a precision of 1 mas/yr or better, when complemented withdata from VHS. Hence, VISIONS can provide proper motions for sourcesinaccessible to Gaia. VISIONS will enable addressing a range of topics,including the 3D distribution and motion of embedded stars and the nearbyinterstellar medium, the identification and characterization of young stellarobjects, the formation and evolution of embedded stellar clusters and theirinitial mass function, as well as the characteristics of interstellar dust andthe reddening law.|

|**Abstract**| The VISIONS public survey provides large-scale, multiepoch imaging of fivenearby star-forming regions at subarcsecond resolution in the near-infrared.All data collected within the program and provided by the European SouthernObservatory (ESO) science archive are processed with a custom end-to-endpipeline infrastructure to provide science-ready images and source catalogs.The data reduction environment has been specifically developed for the purposeof mitigating several shortcomings of the bona fide data products processedwith software provided by the Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit (CASU), suchas spatially variable astrometric and photometric biases of up to 100 mas and0.1 mag, respectively. At the same time, the resolution of coadded images is upto 20% higher compared to the same products from the CASU processingenvironment. Most pipeline modules are written in Python and make extensive useof C extension libraries for numeric computations, thereby simultaneouslyproviding accessibility, robustness, and high performance. The astrometriccalibration is performed relative to the Gaia reference frame, and fluxes arecalibrated with respect to the source magnitudes provided in the Two Micron AllSky Survey (2MASS). For bright sources, absolute astrometric errors aretypically on the order of 10 to 15 mas and fluxes are determined withsubpercent precision. Moreover, the calibration with respect to 2MASSphotometry is largely free of color terms. The pipeline produces data that arecompliant with the ESO Phase 3 regulations and furthermore provides curatedsource catalogs that are structured similarly to those provided by the 2MASSsurvey.|

|**Abstract**| Super-Mercuries, rocky exoplanets with bulk iron mass fraction of more than60 per cent, appear to be preferentially hosted by stars with higher iron massfraction than the Earth. It is unclear whether these iron-rich planets can formin the disc, or if giant impacts are necessary. Here we investigate theformation of super-Mercuries in their natal protoplanetary discs by taking intoaccount their host stars' abundances (Fe, Mg, Si, S). We employ a discevolution model which includes the growth, drift, evaporation andrecondensation of pebbles to compute the pebble iron mass fraction. Therecondensation of outward-drifting iron vapour near the iron evaporation frontis the key mechanism that facilitates an increase in the pebble iron massfraction. We also simulate the growth of planetary seeds around the ironevaporation front using a planet formation model which includes pebbleaccretion and planet migration, and compute the final composition of theplanets. Our simulations are able to reproduce the observed iron compositionsof the super-Mercuries provided that all the iron in the disc are locked inpure Fe grains and that the disc viscosity is low. The combined effects of sloworbital migration of planets and long retention time of iron vapour inlow-viscosity discs makes it easier to form iron-rich planets. Furthermore, wefind that decreasing the stellar Mg/Si ratio results in an increase in the ironmass fraction of the planet due to a reduction in the abundance of Mg2SiO4,which has a very similar condensation temperature as iron, in the disc. Ourresults thus imply that super-Mercuries are more likely to form around starswith low Mg/Si, in agreement with observational data.|

|**Abstract**| Connecting the gas in HII regions to the underlying source of the ionizingradiation can help us constrain the physical processes of stellar feedback andhow HII regions evolve over time. With PHANGS$\unicode{x2013}$MUSE we detectnearly 24,000 HII regions across 19 galaxies and measure the physicalproperties of the ionized gas (e.g. metallicity, ionization parameter,density). We use catalogues of multi-scale stellar associations fromPHANGS$\unicode{x2013}$HST to obtain constraints on the age of the ionizingsources. We construct a matched catalogue of 4,177 HII regions that are clearlylinked to a single ionizing association. A weak anti-correlation is observedbetween the association ages and the H$\alpha$ equivalent width EW(H$\alpha$),the H$\alpha$/FUV flux ratio and the ionization parameter, log q. As all threeare expected to decrease as the stellar population ages, this could indicatethat we observe an evolutionary sequence. This interpretation is furthersupported by correlations between all three properties. Interpreting these asevolutionary tracers, we find younger nebulae to be more attenuated by dust andcloser to giant molecular clouds, in line with recent models offeedback-regulated star formation. We also observe strong correlations with thelocal metallicity variations and all three proposed age tracers, suggestive ofstar formation preferentially occurring in locations of locally enhancedmetallicity. Overall, EW(H$\alpha$) and log q show the most consistent trendsand appear to be most reliable tracers for the age of an HII region.|

|**Abstract**| We present a 1.1mm stacking analysis of moderately massive(log($M_{*}$/$M_{\odot}$) = 10.7 $\pm$ 0.2) quiescent galaxies (QGs) at$\langle z\rangle \sim1.5$, searching for cold dust continuum emission, anexcellent tracer of dust and gas mass. Using both the recent GOODS-ALMA surveyas well as the full suite of ALMA Band-6 ancillary data in the GOODS-S field,we report the tentative detection of dust continuum equivalent of dust masslog($M_{dust}$/$M_{\odot}$) = 7.47 $\pm$ 0.13 and gas masslog($M_{gas}$/$M_{\odot}$) = 9.42 $\pm$ 0.14. The emerging gas fraction is$f_{gas}$ = 5.3 $\pm$ 1.8%, consistent with the results of previous stackinganalyses based on lower resolution sub(mm) observations. Our results supportthe scenario where high-z QGs have an order of magnitude larger $f_{gas}$compared to their local counterparts and have experienced quenching with a nonnegligible gas reservoir in their interstellar medium - i.e. with gasretention. Subsequent analysis yields an anti-correlation between the $f_{gas}$and the stellar mass of QGs, especially in the high mass end where galaxiesreside in the most massive haloes. The $f_{gas}$ - $M_{*}$ anti-correlationpromotes the selection bias as a possible solution to the tension between thestacking results pointing towards gas retention in high-z QGs of moderate$M_{*}$ and the studies of individual targets that favour a fully depleted ISMin massive (log($M_{*}$/$M_{\odot}$) high-z QGs.|

|**Abstract**| Massive disk galaxies like our Milky Way should host an ancient, metal-poor,and centrally concentrated stellar population. This population reflects thestar formation and enrichment in the few most massive progenitor componentsthat coalesced at high redshift to form the proto-Galaxy. While metal-poorstars are known to reside in the inner few kiloparsecs of our Galaxy, currentdata do not yet provide a comprehensive picture of such a metal-poor "heart" ofthe Milky Way. We use information from Gaia DR3, especially the XP spectra, toconstruct a sample of 2 million bright (BP $<15.5$ mag) giant stars within$30^\circ$ of the Galactic Center with robust [M/H] estimates, $\delta$ [M/H]$\lesssim 0.1$. For most sample members we can calculate orbits based on GaiaRVS velocities and astrometry. This sample reveals an extensive, ancient, andmetal-poor population that includes $\sim 18,000$ stars with $-2.7<$ [M/H]$<-1.5$, representing a stellar mass of $\gtrsim 5\times 10^7$ M$_\odot$. Thespatial distribution of these [M/H] $<-1.5$ stars has a Gaussian extent of only$\sigma_{\mathrm{R_{GC}}} \sim 2.7$ kpc around the Galactic center, with mostof these orbits being confined to the inner Galaxy. At high orbitaleccentricities, there is clear evidence for accreted halo stars in theirpericentral orbit phase. Stars with [M/H] $< -2$ show no net rotation, whereasthose with [M/H] $\sim -1$ are rotation dominated. Most of the tightly boundstars show $[\alpha/\text{Fe}]$-enhancement and [Al/Fe]-[Mn/Fe] abundancepatterns expected for an origin in the more massive portions of theproto-Galaxy. These central, metal-poor stars most likely predate the oldestpart of the disk ($\tau_{\text{age}}\approx 12.5$ Gyrs), which implies thatthey formed at $z\gtrsim 5$, forging the proto-Milky Way.|

|**Abstract**| The majority of the Milky Way's stellar halo consists of debris from ourGalaxy's last major merger, the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE). In the past fewyears, stars from GSE have been kinematically and chemically studied in theinner $30$ kpc of our Galaxy. However, simulations predict that accreted debriscould lie at greater distances, forming substructures in the outer halo. Herewe derive metallicities and distances using Gaia DR3 XP spectra for an all-skysample of luminous red giant stars, and map the outer halo with kinematics andmetallicities out to $100$ kpc. We obtain follow-up spectra of stars in twostrong overdensities - including the previously identified Outer VirgoOverdensity - and find them to be relatively metal-rich and on predominantlyretrograde orbits, matching predictions from simulations of the GSE merger. Weargue that these are apocentric shells of GSE debris, forming $60-90$ kpccounterparts to the $15-20$ kpc shells that are known to dominate the innerstellar halo. Extending our search across the sky with literature radialvelocities, we find evidence for a coherent stream of retrograde starsencircling the Milky Way from $50-100$ kpc, in the same plane as theSagittarius stream but moving in the opposite direction. These are the firstdiscoveries of distant and structured imprints from the GSE merger, cementingthe picture of an inclined and retrograde collision that built up our Galaxy'sstellar halo.|

|**Abstract**| JWST observations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission providesome of the deepest and highest resolution views of the cold interstellarmedium (ISM) in nearby galaxies. If PAHs are well mixed with the atomic andmolecular gas and illuminated by the average diffuse interstellar radiationfield, PAH emission may provide an approximately linear, high resolution, highsensitivity tracer of diffuse gas surface density. We present a pilot studythat explores using PAH emission in this way based on MIRI observations of IC5332, NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496 from the PHANGS-JWST Treasury. Usingscaling relationships calibrated in Leroy et al. (2022), scaled F1130W provides10--40 pc resolution and 3$\sigma$ sensitivity of $\Sigma_{\rm gas} \sim 2$M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$. We characterize the surface densities of structures seenat $< 7$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ in our targets, where we expect the gas to beHI-dominated. We highlight the existence of filaments, inter-arm emission, andholes in the diffuse ISM at these low surface densities. Below $\sim 10$M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ for NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496 the gas distributionshows a ``Swiss cheese''-like topology due to holes and bubbles pervading therelatively smooth distribution of diffuse ISM. Comparing to recent galaxysimulations, we observe similar topology for the low surface density gas,though with notable variations between simulations with different setups andresolution. Such a comparison of high resolution, low surface density gas withsimulations is not possible with existing atomic and molecular gas maps,highlighting the unique power of JWST maps of PAH emission.|

|**Abstract**| Earth-sized exoplanets that transit nearby, late spectral type red dwarfswill be prime targets for atmospheric characterization in the coming decade.Such systems, however, are difficult to find via wide-field transit surveyslike Kepler or TESS. Consequently, the presence of such transiting planets isunexplored and the occurrence rates of short-period Earth-sized planets aroundlate M dwarfs remain poorly constrained. Here, we present the deepestphotometric monitoring campaign of 22 nearby late M dwarf stars, using datafrom over 500 nights on seven 1-2 meter class telescopes. Our survey includesall known single quiescent northern late M dwarfs within 15 pc. We usetransit-injection-and-recovery tests to quantify the completeness of oursurvey, successfully identify most ($>80\%$) transiting short-period (0.5-1 d)super-Earths ($R > 1.9 R_\oplus$), and are sensitive ($\sim50\%$) to transitingEarth-sized planets ($1.0-1.2 R_\oplus$). Our high sensitivity to transits witha near-zero false positive rate demonstrates an efficient survey strategy. Oursurvey does not yield a transiting planet detection, yet it provides the mostsensitive upper limits on transiting planets orbiting our target stars.Finally, we explore multiple hypotheses about the occurrence rates ofshort-period planets (from Earth-sized planets to giant planets) around late Mdwarfs. We show, for example, that giant planets at short periods ($<1$ day)are uncommon around our target stars. Our dataset provides some insight intooccurrence rates of short-period planets around TRAPPIST-1-like stars, and ourresults can help test planetary formation and system evolution models, as wellas guide future observations of nearby late M dwarfs.|

|**Abstract**| We present a comprehensive catalog of observations and stellar populationproperties for 23 highly secure host galaxies of fast radio bursts (FRBs). Oursample comprises six repeating FRBs and 17 apparent non-repeaters. We present82 new photometric and eight new spectroscopic observations of these hosts.Using stellar population synthesis modeling and employing non-parametric starformation histories (SFHs), we find that FRB hosts have a median stellar massof $\approx 10^{9.8}\,M_{\odot}$, mass-weighted age of $\approx 5.1$~Gyr, andongoing star formation rate $\approx 1.2\,M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$ but span wideranges in all properties. Classifying the hosts by degree of star formation, wefind that 91\% (21/23 hosts) are star-forming, one is transitioning, and one isquiescent. The majority trace the star-forming main sequence of galaxies, butat least two FRBs originate in less active environments, both of which areapparent non-repeaters. Across all modeled properties, we find no statisticallysignificant distinction between the hosts of repeaters and non-repeaters.However, the hosts of repeating FRBs generally extend to lower stellar masses,and the hosts of non-repeaters arise in more optically luminous galaxies. Whilefour of the galaxies with the most clear and prolonged rises in their SFHs allhost repeating FRBs, demonstrating heightened star formation activity in thelast $\lesssim 100$~Myr, one non-repeating host shows this SFH. Our resultssupport the young magnetar model for most FRBs in which their progenitorsformed through core-collapse supernovae, but the presence of some FRBs in lessactive environments suggests a fraction form through more delayed channels.|

|**Abstract**| We present maps of the 3.3 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)emission feature in NGC 628, NGC 1365, and NGC 7496 as observed with theNear-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) imager on JWST from the PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1Treasury project. We create maps that isolate the 3.3 micron PAH feature in theF335M filter (F335M$_{\rm PAH}$) using combinations of the F300M and F360Mfilters for removal of starlight continuum. This continuum removal iscomplicated by contamination of the F360M by PAH emission and variations in thestellar spectral energy distribution slopes between 3.0 and 3.6 micron. Wemodify the empirical prescription from Lai et al. (2020) to remove thestarlight continuum in our highly resolved galaxies, which have a range ofstarlight- and PAH-dominated lines-of-sight. Analyzing radially binned profilesof the F335M$_{\rm PAH}$ emission, we find that between 5-65% of the F335Mintensity comes from the 3.3 micron feature within the inner 0.5 $r_{25}$ ofour targets. This percentage systematically varies from galaxy to galaxy, andshows radial trends within the galaxies related to each galaxy's distributionof stellar mass, interstellar medium, and star formation. The 3.3 micronemission is well correlated with the 11.3 micron PAH feature traced with theMIRI F1130W filter, as is expected, since both features arise from C-Hvibrational modes. The average F335M$_{\rm PAH}$/F1130W ratio agrees with thepredictions of recent models by Draine et al. (2021) for PAHs with size andcharge distributions shifted towards larger grains with normal or higherionization.|

|**Abstract**| We present spatially resolved kinematics of 31 ALMA-identified dust-obscuredstar-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at $z\sim$1.3-2.6, as traced by H$\alpha$emission using VLT/KMOS near-infrared integral field spectroscopy from ouron-going Large Programme ''KMOS-ALMA Observations of Submillimetre Sources''(KAOSS). We derive H$\alpha$ rotation curves and velocity dispersion profilesfor the DSFGs. Of the 31 sources with bright, spatially extended H$\alpha$emission, 25 display rotation curves that are well fit by a Freeman disc model,enabling us to measure a median inclination-corrected velocity at 2.2$R_{\rmd}$ of $v_{\rm rot}$ = 190 $\pm$ 30 kms$^{-1}$ and a median intrinsic velocitydispersion of $\sigma_0$ = 87 $\pm$ 6 kms$^{-1}$ for these $\textit{disc-like}$sources. By comparison with less actively star-forming galaxies, KAOSS DSFGsare both faster rotating and more turbulent, but have similar $v_{\rmrot}/\sigma_0$ ratios, median 2.4 $\pm$ 0.5. We suggest that $v_{\rmrot}/\sigma_0$ alone is insufficient to describe the kinematics of DSFGs, whichare not kinematically ''cold'' discs, and that the individual components$v_{\rm rot}$ and $\sigma_0$ indicate that they are in fact turbulent, butrotationally supported systems in $\sim$50 per cent of cases. This turbulencemay be driven by star formation or mergers/interactions. We estimate thenormalisation of the stellar Tully-Fisher relation (sTFR) for the disc-likeDSFGs and compare it with local studies, finding no evolution at fixed slopebetween $z\sim$2 and $z\sim$0. Finally, we use kinematic estimates of DSFG halomasses to investigate the stellar-to-halo mass relation, finding our sources tobe consistent with shock heating and strong feedback which likely drives thedeclining stellar content in the most massive halos.|

|**Abstract**| The first JWST observations of nearby galaxies have unveiled a richpopulation of bubbles that trace the stellar feedback mechanisms responsiblefor their creation. Studying these bubbles therefore allows us to chart theinteraction between stellar feedback and the interstellar medium, and thelarger galactic flows needed to regulate star formation processes globally. Wepresent the first catalog of bubbles in NGC628, visually identified using MIRIF770W PHANGS-JWST observations, and use them to statistically evaluate bubblecharacteristics. We classify 1694 structures as bubbles with radii between6-552 pc. Of these, 31% contain at least one smaller bubble at their edge,indicating that previous generations of star formation have a local impact onwhere new stars form. On large scales, most bubbles lie near a spiral arm, andtheir radii increase downstream compared to upstream. Furthermore, bubbles areelongated in a similar direction to the spiral arm ridge-line. These azimuthaltrends demonstrate that star formation is intimately connected to the spiralarm passage. Finally, the bubble size distribution follows a power-law of index$p=-2.2\pm0.1$, which is slightly shallower than the theoretical value by1-3.5$\sigma$ that did not include bubble mergers. The fraction of bubblesidentified within the shells of larger bubbles suggests that bubble merging isa common process. Our analysis therefore allows us to quantify the number ofstar-forming regions that are influenced by an earlier generation, and the rolefeedback processes have in setting the global star formation rate. With thefull PHANGS-JWST sample, we can do this for more galaxies.|

|**Abstract**| Transition disks are protoplanetary disks with inner cavities possiblycleared by massive companions, which makes them prime targets to observe athigh resolution to map their velocity structure. We present ALMA Band 6 dustand gas observations of the transition disk around RXJ1604.3-2130 A, known tofeature nearly symmetric shadows in scattered light. We studied the $^{12}$COline channel maps and moment maps of the line of sight velocity and peakintensity. We fitted a Keplerian model of the channel-by-channel emission tostudy line profile differences and produced deprojected radial profiles for allvelocity components. The $^{12}$CO emission shows a cavity inwards of $\sim$56au and within the dust continuum ring at 81 au. The azimuthal brightnessvariations in the $^{12}$CO line and dust continuum are broadly aligned withthe shadows detected in scattered-light observations. We find a stronglocalized non-Keplerian feature toward the west within the continuum ring (at$R=41\pm 10$ au and $PA=280\pm 2 ^\circ$). A tightly wound spiral is alsodetected which extends over 300$^\circ$ in azimuth, possibly connected to thelocalized non-Keplerian feature. Finally, a bending of the iso-velocitycontours within the gas cavity indicates a highly perturbed inner region,possibly related to the presence of a misaligned inner disk. While broadlyaligned with the scattered-light shadows, the localized non-Keplerian featurecannot be solely due to changes in temperature. Instead, we interpret thekinematical feature as tracing a massive companion located at the edge of thedust continuum ring. We speculate that the spiral is caused by buoyancyresonances driven by planet-disk interactions. However, this potential planetat $\sim$41 au cannot explain the gas-depleted cavity, the low accretion rate,and the misaligned inner disk, which suggests the presence of another companioncloser in.|

|**Abstract**| We report the complete statistical planetary sample from the prime fields($\Gamma \geq 2~{\rm hr}^{-1}$) of the 2019 Korea Microlensing TelescopeNetwork (KMTNet) microlensing survey. We develop the optimized KMTNetAnomalyFinder algorithm and apply it to the 2019 KMTNet prime fields. We find atotal of 14 homogeneously selected planets and report the analysis of threeplanetary events, KMT-2019-BLG-(1042,1552,2974). The planet-host mass ratios,$q$, for the three planetary events are $6.34 \times 10^{-4}, 4.89 \times10^{-3}$ and $6.18 \times 10^{-4}$, respectively. A Bayesian analysis indicatesthe three planets are all cold giant planets beyond the snow line of their hoststars. The 13 planets are basically uniform in $\log q$ over the range $-5.0 <\log q < -1.5$. This result suggests that the planets below $q_{\rm break} =1.7 \times 10^{-4}$ proposed by the MOA-II survey may be more common thanpreviously believed. This work is an early component of a large project todetermine the KMTNet mass-ratio function, and the whole sample of 2016--2019KMTNet events should contain about 120 planets.|

|**Abstract**| We aim to revisit the system AB Pic which has a known companion at theexoplanet/ brown-dwarf boundary. We based this study on a rich set ofobservations to investigate the companion's orbit and atmosphere. We composed aspectrum of AB Pic b merging archival VLT/SINFONI K-band data, with publishedspectra at J and H-band (SINFONI) and Lp-band (Magellan-AO), and photometricmeasurements (HST and Spitzer). We modeled the spectrum with ForMoSA, based ontwo atmospheric models: ExoREM and BT-SETTL13. We determined the orbitalproperties of b fitting the astrometric measurements from NaCo (2003 and 2004)and SPHERE (2015). The orbital solutions favor a semi-major axis of $\sim$190auviewed edge-on. With Exo-REM, we derive a T$_{eff}$ of 1700$\pm$50K and surfacegravity of 4.5$\pm$0.3dex, consistent with previous works, and we report forthe first time a C/O ratio of 0.58$\pm$0.08 ($\sim$solar). The posteriors aresensitive to the wavelength interval and the family of models used. Given the2.1hr rotation period and our vsin(i) of $\sim$73km/s, we estimate for thefirst time the true obliquity to be $\sim$45 or $\sim$135deg, indicating asignificant misalignment between the planet's spin and orbit orientations.Finally, a proper motion anomaly between the Hipparcos and Gaia eDR3 comparedto our SPHERE detection limits and adapted radial velocity limits indicate theexistence of a $\sim$6M$_{Jup}$ inner planet orbiting from 2 to 10au(40-200mas). The possible existence of an inner companion and the likelymiss-alignment of the spin axis orientation strongly favor a formation path bygravitational instability or core accretion within a disk closer insidefollowed by dynamical interactions. Confirmation and characterization of planetc and access to a broader wavelength coverage for planet b will be essential toprobe the uncertainties associated with the parameters.|
