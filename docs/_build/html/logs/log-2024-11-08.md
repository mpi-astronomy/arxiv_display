|**Abstract**|            This study investigates the influence of Herbig-Haro jets on initiating star formation in dense environments. When molecular clouds are nearing gravitational instability, the impact of a protostellar jet could provide the impetus needed to catalyse star formation. A high-energy-density experiment was carried out at the LULI2000 laser facility, where a supersonic jet generated by a nanosecond laser was used to compress a foam or plastic ball, mimicking the interaction of a Herbig-Haro jet with a molecular cloud. Simulations using the 3D radiation hydrodynamics code TROLL provided comprehensive data for analysing ball compression and calculating jet characteristics. After applying scaling laws, similarities between stellar and experimental jets were explored. Diagnostic simulations, including density gradient, emission and X-ray radiographies, showed strong agreement with experimental data. The results of the experiment, supported by simulations, demonstrated that the impact of a protostellar jet on a molecular cloud could reduce the Bonnor-Ebert mass by approximately 9%, thereby initiating collapse.         |
