|**Abstract**|            We present the Red Unknowns: Bright Infrared Extragalactic Survey (RUBIES), providing JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of red sources selected across ~150 arcmin$^2$ from public JWST/NIRCam imaging in the UDS and EGS fields. RUBIES novel observing strategy offers a well-quantified selection function: the survey is optimised to reach high (>70%) completeness for bright and red (F150W-F444W>2) sources that are very rare. To place these rare sources in context, we simultaneously observe a reference sample of the 2<z<7 galaxy population, sampling sources at a rate that is inversely proportional to their number density in the 3D space of F444W magnitude, F150W-F444W colour, and photometric redshift. In total, RUBIES observes ~3000 targets across $1<z_{phot}<10$ with both the PRISM and G395M dispersers, and ~1500 targets at $z_{phot}>3$ using only the G395M disperser. The RUBIES data reveal a highly diverse population of red sources that span a broad redshift range ($z_{spec}\sim1-9$), with photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction that are 3 times higher than for similarly bright sources that are less red. This diversity is not apparent from the photometric SEDs. Only spectroscopy reveals that the SEDs encompass a mixture of galaxies with dust-obscured star formation, extreme line emission, a lack of star formation indicating early quenching, and luminous active galactic nuclei. As a first demonstration of our broader selection function we compare the stellar masses and rest-frame U-V colours of the red sources and our reference sample: red sources are typically more massive ($M_*\sim10^{10-11.5} M_\odot$) across all redshifts. However, we find that the most massive systems span a wide range in U-V colour. We describe our data reduction procedure and data quality, and publicly release the reduced RUBIES data and vetted spectroscopic redshifts of the first half of the survey through the DJA.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Fe II/Mg II emission line flux ratio in quasar spectra serves as a proxy for the relative Fe to alpha-element abundances in the broad line regions of quasars. Due to the expected different enrichment timescales of the two elements, they can be used as a cosmic clock in the early Universe. We present a study of the Fe II/Mg II ratios in a sample of luminous quasars exploiting high-quality near-IR spectra taken primarily by the XQR-30 program with VLT XSHOOTER. These quasars have a median bolometric luminosity of log(L_bol[erg s^-1])~47.3 and cover a redshift range of z=6.0-6.6. The median value of the measured Fe II/Mg II ratios is ~7.9 with a normalized median absolute deviation of ~2.2. In order to trace the cosmic evolution of Fe II/Mg II in an unbiased manner, we select two comparison samples of quasars with similar luminosities and high-quality spectra from the literature, one at intermediate redshifts (z=3.5-4.8) and the other at low redshifts (z=1.0-2.0). We perform the same spectral analysis for all these quasars, including the usage of the same iron template, the same spectral fitting method, and the same wavelength fitting windows. We find no significant redshift evolution in the Fe II/Mg II ratio over the wide redshift range from z=1 to 6.6. The result is consistent with previous studies and supports the scenario of a rapid iron enrichment in the vicinity of accreting supermassive black holes at high redshift.         |

|**Abstract**|            Temperate exoplanets between the sizes of Earth and Neptune, known as "sub-Neptunes", have emerged as intriguing targets for astrobiology. It is unknown whether these planets resemble Earth-like terrestrial worlds with a habitable surface, Neptune-like giant planets with deep atmospheres and no habitable surface, or something exotic in between. Recent JWST transmission spectroscopy observations of the canonical sub-Neptune K2-18 b revealed ~1% CH4, ~1% CO2, and a non-detection of CO in the atmosphere. While previous studies have proposed that the observed atmospheric composition could help constrain the lower atmosphere conditions and determine the interior structure of sub-Neptunes like K2-18 b, the possible interactions between the atmosphere and a hot, supercritical water ocean at its base remain unexplored. In this work, we investigate whether a global supercritical water ocean, resembling a planetary-scale hydrothermal system, can explain these observations on K2-18 b-like sub-Neptunes through equilibrium aqueous geochemical calculations. We find that the observed atmospheric CH4/CO2 ratio implies a minimum ocean temperature of ~715 K, whereas the corresponding CO/CO2 ratio allows ocean temperatures up to ~1060 K. These results indicate that a global supercritical water ocean on K2-18 b is plausible. While life cannot survive in this ocean, this work represents the first step towards understanding how a global supercritical water ocean may influence observable atmospheric characteristics on volatile-rich sub-Neptunes. Future observations with better constrained NH3 and CO mixing ratios could further help distinguish between possible interior compositions of K2-18 b.         |

|**Abstract**|            Ly$\alpha$ is the transition to the ground state from the first excited state of hydrogen (the most common element). Resonant scattering of this line by neutral hydrogen greatly impedes its emergence from galaxies, so the fraction of galaxies which show Ly$\alpha$ is a tracer of the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium (IGM), and thus the history of reionization. In previous works, we used early JWST/NIRSpec data from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) to classify and characterise Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies (LAEs). This survey is now approaching completion, and the current sample is nearly an order of magnitude larger. From a sample of 784 galaxies in JADES at $4.0<z<14.3$, we find evidence for Ly$\alpha$ emission in 145 sources. We reproduce the previously found correlation between Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction (\fesc) - Ly$\alpha$ rest-frame equivalent width (\rew) and the negative correlation between Ly$\alpha$ velocity offset - \fesc. Both \fesc and \rew decrease with redshift ($z\gtrsim5.5$), indicating the progression of reionization on a population scale. Our data are used to demonstrate an increasing IGM transmission of Ly$\alpha$ from $z\sim14-6$. We measure the completeness-corrected fraction of LAEs ($X_{Ly\alpha}$) from $z=4-9.5$. An application of these $X_{Ly\alpha}$ values to the results of cosmological models suggests a high neutral fraction at $z=7$ ($\rm X_{HI}=0.81_{-0.10}^{+0.07}$), likely suggesting the need for models with updated \rew distributions (based on comparison to other works). This large sample of LAEs and the completeness correction we have detailed will be paramount for unbiased population studies of galaxies in the EoR.         |
