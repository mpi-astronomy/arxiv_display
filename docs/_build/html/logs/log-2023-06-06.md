|**Abstract**| We present an overview of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), an ambitious program of infrared imaging and spectroscopy in the GOODS-S and GOODS-N deep fields, designed to study galaxy evolution from high redshift to cosmic noon. JADES uses about 770 hours of Cycle 1 guaranteed time largely from the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) instrument teams. In GOODS-S, in and around the Hubble Ultra Deep Field and Chandra Deep Field South, JADES produces a deep imaging region of ~45 arcmin$^2$ with an average of 130 hrs of exposure time spread over 9 NIRCam filters. This is extended at medium depth in GOODS-S and GOODS-N with NIRCam imaging of ~175 arcmin$^2$ with an average exposure time of 20 hrs spread over 8-10 filters. In both fields, we conduct extensive NIRSpec multi-object spectroscopy, including 2 deep pointings of 55 hrs exposure time, 14 medium pointings of ~12 hrs, and 15 shallower pointings of ~4 hrs, targeting over 5000 HST and JWST-detected faint sources with 5 low, medium, and high-resolution dispersers covering 0.6-5.3 microns. Finally, JADES extends redward via coordinated parallels with the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), featuring ~9 arcmin$^2$ with 43 hours of exposure at 7.7 microns and twice that area with 2-6.5 hours of exposure at 12.8 microns For nearly 30 years, the GOODS-S and GOODS-N fields have been developed as the premier deep fields on the sky; JADES is now providing a compelling start on the JWST legacy in these fields. |

|**Abstract**| We use deep NIRSpec spectroscopic data from the JADES survey to derive the star formation histories (SFHs) of a sample of 200 galaxies at 0.6$<$z$<$11 and spanning stellar masses from $\rm 10^6$ to $\rm 10^{9.5}~M_\odot$. We find that galaxies at high-redshift, galaxies above the Main Sequence (MS) and low-mass galaxies tend to host younger stellar populations than their low-redshift, massive, and below the MS counterparts. Interestingly, the correlation between age, M$_*$ and SFR existed even earlier than Cosmic Noon, out to the earliest cosmic epochs. However, these trends have a large scatter. Indeed, there are examples of young stellar populations also below the MS, indicating recent (bursty) star formation in evolved systems. We explore further the burstiness of the SFHs by using the ratio between SFR averaged over the last 10 Myr and averaged between 10 Myr and 100 Myr before the epoch of observation ($\mathrm{SFR_{cont, 10}/SFR_{cont, 90}}$). We find that high-redshift and low-mass galaxies have particularly bursty SFHs, while more massive and lower-redshift systems evolve more steadily. We also present the discovery of another (mini-)quenched galaxy at z = 4.4 (in addition to the one at z=7.3 reported by Looser et al. 2023), which might be only temporarily quiescent as a consequence of the extremely bursty evolution. Finally, we also find a steady decline of dust reddening of the stellar population approaching the earliest cosmic epochs, although some dust reddening is still observed in some of the highest redshift and most star forming systems. |

|**Abstract**| The rest-frame UV recombination emission line Ly-alpha can be powered by ionizing photons from young massive stars in star forming galaxies, but its ability to be resonantly scattered by neutral gas complicates its interpretation. For reionization era galaxies, a neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) will scatter Ly-alpha from the line of sight, making Ly-alpha a useful probe of the neutral fraction at z>6. Here, we explore Ly-alpha in JWST/NIRSpec spectra from the ongoing GTO program JADES, which targets hundreds of galaxies in the well-studied GOODS-S and GOODS-N fields. These sources are UV-faint (-20.4<MUV<-16.4), and thus represent a poorly-explored class of galaxies. The low spectral resolution (R~100) spectra of a subset of 93 galaxies in GOODS-S with z_spec>5.5 (as derived with optical lines) are fit with line and continuum models, in order to search for significant line emission. Through exploration of the R100 data, we find evidence for Ly-alpha in 15 sources. Additional analysis of the R1000 data from the same set of galaxies results in five additional detections. This sample allows us to place observational constraints on the fraction of galaxies with Ly-alpha emission in the redshift range 5.5<z<7.5, with a decrease from z=6 to z=7. We also find a positive correlation between Ly-alpha equivalent width and MUV, as seen in other samples. These results are used to estimate the neutral gas fraction at z~7, agreeing with previous results (XHI~0.5-0.9). |

|**Abstract**| The physical processes that establish the morphological evolution and the structural diversity of galaxies are key unknowns in extragalactic astrophysics. Here we report the finding of the morphologically-mature galaxy JADES-GS+53.18343-27.79097, which existed within the first 700 million years of the Universe's history. This star-forming galaxy with a stellar mass of $10^{8.6}$ solar masses consists of three components, a highly-compact core with a half-light radius of 144 pc, a strongly star-forming disc with a radius of 468 pc, and a star-forming clump, which all show distinctive star-formation histories. The central stellar mass density of this galaxy is within a factor of two of the most massive present-day ellipticals, while being globally 1000 times less massive. The radial profile of the specific star-formation rate is strongly rising toward the outskirts. This evidence strongly suggests the first detection of inside-out growth of a galaxy as a proto-bulge and a star-forming disc in the Epoch of Reionization. |

|**Abstract**| We describe the NIRSpec component of the JWST Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), and provide deep spectroscopy of 253 sources targeted with the NIRSpec micro-shutter assembly in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field and surrounding GOODS-South. The multi-object spectra presented here are the deepest so far obtained with JWST, amounting to up to 28 hours in the low-dispersion ($R\sim 30-300$) prism, and up to 7 hours in each of the three medium-resolution $R\approx 1000$ gratings and one high-dispersion grating, G395H ($R\approx2700$). Our low-dispersion and medium-dispersion spectra cover the wavelength range $0.6-5.3\mu$m. We describe the selection of the spectroscopic targets, the strategy for the allocation of targets to micro-shutters, and the design of the observations. We present the public release of the reduced 2D and 1D spectra, and a description of the reduction and calibration process. We measure spectroscopic redshifts for 178 of the objects targeted extending up to $z=13.2$. We present a catalog of all emission lines detected at $S/N>5$, and our redshift determinations for the targets. Combined with the first JADES NIRCam data release, these public JADES spectroscopic and imaging datasets provide a new foundation for discoveries of the infrared universe by the worldwide scientific community. |
