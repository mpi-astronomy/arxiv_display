|**Abstract**|            Luminous quasars at $z>4$ provide key insights into the early Universe. Their rarity necessitates wide-field multi-band surveys to efficiently separate them from the main astrophysical contaminants (i.e., ultracool dwarfs). To expand the sample of high-$z$ quasars, we conducted targeted selections using optical, infrared, and radio surveys, complemented by literature-based quasar candidate catalogs. In this paper, we report the discovery of \nqsos\ new quasars at $4.6<z<6.9$ (six at $z\geq6.5$), with $M_{1450}$ between $-$25.4 and $-$27.0. We also present new spectra of six $z>6.5$ quasars we selected, but whose independent discovery has already been published in the literature. Three of the newly discovered quasars are strong radio emitters (L$_{1.4~\rm GHz}$$=0.09-1.0\times$10$^{34}$erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$). Among them, one source at $z=4.71$ exhibits typical blazar-like properties, including a flat radio spectrum, radio-loudness $\sim$1000, and multi-frequency variability. It is also detected by SRG/eROSITA X-ray telescope (f$_{\rm 0.2-2.3keV} \sim 1.3\times10^{-13}$erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$). In addition, for seven $6.3<z<6.9$ quasars we present near-infrared spectroscopy and estimate the central black hole mass from their C$\rm IV$ and Mg$\rm II$ broad emission this http URL masses (log[M$_{\rm BH,MgII}$]$=8.58-9.14~\rm M_{\odot}$) and Eddington ratios ($\lambda_{\rm Edd,MgII}=0.74-2.2$) are consistent with other $z>6$ quasars reported in the literature. A $z = 6.3$ quasar exhibits a velocity difference of approximately $9000$ km s$^{-1}$ between the C$\rm IV$ and Mg$\rm II$ emission lines, making it one of the most extreme C$\rm IV$ outflows currently known. Additionally, the sample includes three high-ionization broad absorption line quasars. One of these quasars shows potential evidence of an extremely fast outflow feature, reaching $48000$ km s$^{-1}$.         |

|**Abstract**|            AGNs exhibit a wide range of black hole masses and inflow/outflow properties. It is now possible to probe regions close to the event horizons of nearby SMBHs using VLBI with earth-sized baselines, as performed by the EHT. This study explores the emission properties of accretion and outflows near the event horizon of both low-mass and high-mass SMBHs. Using resistive GR-MHD simulations, we model AGNs with thin Keplerian disks. This contrasts with widely studied models featuring thick disks, such as magnetically arrested disks (MADs) or the standard and normal evolution (SANE) scenario. Our models serve as simplified representations to study disk-jet-wind structures. These simulations are postprocessed and ray-traced, using constraints of black hole mass and observed SEDs. Thermal synchrotron emission generated near the event horizon is used to create emission maps, which are analysed by separating accretion and outflow components to determine their contributions to the total intensity. Whether the emission appears optically thick or thin at a given frequency depends on its position relative to the synchrotron SED peak. At 230 GHz, low-mass SMBHs appear optically thicker than high-mass ones, even at lower accretion rates. Doppler beaming affects the brightness of emission from outflows with changing viewing angles in low-mass systems. Eddington ratios from our models align with those inferred by the EHTC for M87 and SgrA* using thicker MAD/SANE models. Although thin disks are optically thicker, their spectral properties make high-mass systems appear optically thinner at 230 GHz; ideal for probing GR effects like photon rings. In contrast, low-mass systems remain optically thicker at these frequencies because of synchrotron self-absorption, making outflow emissions near the horizon more pronounced. However, distinguishing these features remains challenging with current EHT resolution.         |

|**Abstract**|            A stellar common envelope occurs in a binary system when the atmosphere of an evolving star expands to encompass an orbiting companion object. Such systems are predicted to evolve rapidly, ejecting the stellar envelope and leaving the companion in a tighter orbit around a stripped star. We used radio timing to identify a pulsar, PSR J1928+1815, with a spin period of 10.55 ms in a compact binary system with an orbital period of 3.60 hours. The companion star has 1.0 to 1.6 solar masses, eclipses the pulsar for about 17% of the orbit, and is undetected at other wavelengths, so it is most likely a stripped helium star. We interpret this system as having recently undergone a common envelope phase, producing a compact binary.         |

|**Abstract**|            The effectiveness and stability of mass transfer in binaries system are crucial in determining its final product. Rapid binary population synthesis (BPS) codes simplify the complex physics of mass transfer by adopting parameterized prescriptions for the stability of mass transfer, accretion efficiency in stable mass transfer, and the efficiency of common-envelope ejection. We calibrate these uncertain parameters by comparing BPS models with observational data. White dwarf and main sequence binaries are an ideal population to study binary interaction, as they can be formed through stable or unstable mass transfer, or without interaction, which affect the orbital period and masses of the present-day population. The APOGEE-GALEX-Gaia catalog provides a homogeneous sample of over 500 systems with well measured radial velocities that can be used as a comparison baseline for BPS simulations of such binaries. We compare the distribution of observed maximum radial velocity variation ($\Delta RV_{\rm max}$) and estimated masses to BPS models simulated with COSMIC, varying the mass transfer and common-envelope ejection efficiency, and the criteria for mass transfer stability at key evolutionary stages. The $\Delta RV_{\rm max}$ comparison shows clear preference for a higher fraction of stable mass transfer during the first ascent giant branch, and for highly effective envelope ejection. For the systems with WD masses, there is a slight preference for non-conservative mass transfer. In COSMIC and similar codes, the envelope ejection efficiency and the envelope binding energy are degenerate parameters. Our result of high ejection efficiency may indicate that either additional sources of energy are required to eject the envelope, or that its binding energy is lower than traditionally assumed. Future comparisons to BPS simulations can be drawn for other datasets as they become available.         |

|**Abstract**|            In the axion model, electromagnetic waves interacting with axions induce frequency-dependent time delays, determined by the axion mass and decay constant. These small delays are difficult to detect, making traditional methods ineffective. To address this, we computed time delays for various parameters and found a prominent dispersion signal when the wave frequency equals half the axion mass. Based on this, we developed a machine learning-based pipeline, achieving 95\% classification accuracy and demonstrating strong detection capability in low signal-to-noise data. Applying this to PSR J1933-6211, we found no axion-induced delays within current sensitivity limits. While existing constraints are limited by atomic clock resolution in radio telescopes, future advances in optical clocks and broader bandwidths will enable more extensive searches. In particular, combining high-precision optical clocks with next-generation radio telescopes, such as the Qitai Radio Telescope, could improve decay constant constraints by four orders of magnitude for axion masses in the $10^{-6} \sim 10^{-4}$ eV range.         |

|**Abstract**|            NIRCam and MIRI coronagraphy have successfully demonstrated the ability to directly image young sub-Jupiter mass and mature gas-giant exoplanets. However, these modes struggle to reach the sensitivities needed to find the population of cold giant planets that are similar to our own Solar System's giant planets ($T_{\rm eff} = 60 - 125$ K; $a=5 - 30$ AU). For the first time, we explore the high-contrast imaging capabilities of MIRI imaging rather than coronagraphy. Using data from the JWST GO 6122: Cool Kids on the Block program which targets nearby ($<6$ pc) M-dwarfs with NIRCam coronagraphy and MIRI imaging, we demonstrate that 21$\mu$m MIRI imaging can detect planets with the same temperature, mass, age, and orbital separations as Saturn and Jupiter. For systems within 3pc, 21$\mu$m MIRI imaging reaches the sensitivity needed to detect planets colder than Saturn ($<95$ K). NIRCam coronagraphy can achieve similar results only in the unlikely case that a cold giant planet is cloud-free. Motivated by these compelling findings, we extend our analysis to evaluate the measured performance of MIRI F2100W imaging versus NIRCam F444W coronagraphy to 70 pc and conclude that MIRI imaging offers the advantage for systems within 20pc. Microlensing surveys predict an occurrence rate as high as 1 - 2 low-mass giant exoplanets per star, suggesting that JWST MIRI imaging surveys of nearby systems may be poised to uncover a substantial population. This breakthrough enables a path towards the first direct characterization of cold giant exoplanets that are analogous to the solar system giant planets.         |
