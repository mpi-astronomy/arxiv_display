|**Abstract**|            Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) is the Milky Way's most massive globular cluster and is likely the stripped nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy. In this paper, we analyze $\omega$ Cen's kinematics using data from oMEGACat, a comprehensive catalog of $\omega$ Cen's central regions, including 1.4 million proper motion measurements and 300,000 spectroscopic radial velocities. Our velocity dispersion profiles and kinematic maps are consistent with previous work but improve on their resolution, precision, and spatial coverage. The cluster's 3D dispersion is isotropic in the core, with increasing radial anisotropy at larger radii. The 2D kinematic maps show an elongation of the velocity dispersion field comparable to the flattening observed photometrically. We find good agreement between proper motions and line-of-sight velocity dispersion and measure a kinematic distance of 5494$\pm$61 pc, the most precise kinematic distance to $\omega$ Cen available. The subset of data with precise metallicity measurements shows no correlation between metallicity and kinematics, supporting the picture of well-mixed stellar populations within the half-light radius of $\omega$ Cen. Finally, we study the degree of energy equipartition using a large range of stellar masses. We find partial energy equipartition in the center that decreases towards large radii. The spatial dependence of the radial energy equipartition is stronger than the tangential energy equipartition. Our kinematic observations can serve as a new reference for future dynamical modeling efforts that will help to further disentangle the complex mass distribution within $\omega$ Cen.         |

|**Abstract**|            Fundamental questions about the physics responsible for fragmenting molecular parsec-scale clumps into cores of ~1000 au are still open, that only a statistically significant investigation with ALMA is able to address: what are the dominant agents that determine the core demographics, mass, and spatial distribution as a function of the physical properties of the hosting clumps, their evolutionary stage and the different Galactic environments in which they reside? To what extent extent is fragmentation driven by clumps dynamics or mass transport in filaments? With ALMAGAL we observed the 1.38 mm continuum and lines toward more than 1000 dense clumps in our Galaxy, with M>500M_sun, surface density > 0.1 g/cm2 and d<7.5 kpc. The ACA and two 12-m array setups were used to deliver a minimum resolution of ~1000 au over the entire sample distance range. The sample covers all evolutionary stages from infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) to HII regions from the tip of the Galactic bar to the outskirts of the Galaxy. The spectral setup includes several molecular lines to trace the multiscale physics and dynamics of gas, notably CH3CN, H2CO, SiO, CH3OH, DCN, HC3N, SO etc. We present an initial overview of the observations and the early science product and results, with a first characterization of the morphological properties of the continuum emission. We use "perimeter-versus-area" and convex hull-versus-area metrics to classify the different morphologies. More extended and morphologically complex shapes are found toward clumps that are relatively more evolved and have higher surface densities.         |

|**Abstract**|            The ALMAGAL Large Program has observed 1017 high-mass star-forming regions distributed throughout the Galaxy, sampling different evolutionary stages and environmental conditions. In this work, we present the acquisition and processing of the ALMAGAL data. The main goal is to set up a robust pipeline that generates science-ready products, with a good and uniform quality across the whole sample. ALMAGAL observations were performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Each field was observed in three different telescope arrays, being sensitive to spatial scales ranging from 1000 au up to 0.1 pc. The spectral setup allows sensitive imaging of the continuum emission at 219 GHz, and it covers multiple molecular spectral lines observed in four different spectral windows that span about 4 GHz in frequency coverage. We have designed a Python-based processing workflow to calibrate and image these observational data. This ALMAGAL pipeline includes an improved continuum determination, suited for line-rich sources; an automatic self-calibration process that improves the dynamical range of the final images; and the combination of data from different telescope arrays to produce science-ready, fully combined images. The fully combined products have spatial resolutions in the range 800-2000 au, and mass sensitivities in the range 0.02-0.07 Mo. We also present a first analysis of the spectral line information included in the ALMAGAL setup, and its potential for future scientific studies. As an example, specific spectral lines at 1000 au scales resolve the presence of multiple outflows in clusters and will help us to search for disk candidates around massive protostars. Moreover, the broad frequency bands provide information on the chemical richness of the different cluster members, which can be used to study the chemical evolution during the formation process of star clusters.         |

|**Abstract**|            The mechanisms behind the fragmentation of high-mass dense clumps into compact star-forming cores are fundamental topics in current astrophysical research. The ALMAGAL survey provides the opportunity to study this process at an unprecedented level of detail and statistical significance, featuring high-angular resolution $1.38$ mm ALMA observations of $1013$ massive dense clumps at various Galactic locations. These clumps cover a wide range of distances, masses, surface densities, and evolutionary stages. Here, we present the catalog of compact sources obtained with the CuTEx algorithm from continuum images of the full ALMAGAL clump sample combining ACA-$7$m and $12$m ALMA arrays, reaching a uniform high median spatial resolution of $\sim1400$ au. We discuss the fragmentation properties and the estimated physical parameters of the core population. The ALMAGAL compact source catalog includes $6348$ cores detected in $844$ clumps ($83\%$ of the total), with a number of cores per clump between $1$ and $49$ (median of $5$). The estimated core diameters are mostly within $\sim800-3000$ au (median of $1700$ au). We obtained core masses from $0.002$ to $345\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. We evaluated the variation in the core mass function (CMF) with evolution as traced by the clump $L/M$, finding a clear, robust shift and change in slope among CMFs within subsamples at different stages. This finding suggests that the CMF shape is not constant throughout the star formation process, but rather it builds (and flattens) with evolution, with higher core masses reached at later stages. We found that all cores within a clump grow in mass on average with evolution, and the number of cores increases with the core masses. Our results favor a clump-fed scenario for high-mass star formation, in which cores form as low-mass seeds, and then gain mass while further fragmentation occurs in the clump.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a study of the galaxy merger and interaction activity within the Hyperion Proto-supercluster at z~2.5 in an effort to assess the occurrence of galaxy mergers and interactions in contrast to the coeval field and their impact on the build up of stellar mass in high density environments at higher-z. For this work, we utilize data from the Charting Cluster Construction with VUDS and ORELSE Survey (C3VO) along with extensive spectroscopic and photometric datasets available for the COSMOS field, including the HST-Hyperion Survey. To evaluate potential merger and interaction activity, we measure the fraction of galaxies with close kinematic companions ($f_{ckc}$) both within Hyperion and the coeval field by means of a Monte Carlo (MC) methodology developed in this work that probabilistically employs our entire combined spectroscopic and photometric dataset. We validate our $f_{ckc}$ MC methodology on a simulated lightcone built from the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly semi-analytic model, and we determine correction factors that account for the underlying spectroscopic sampling rate of our dataset. We find that galaxies in Hyperion have close kinematic companions $\gtrsim 2\times$ more than galaxies in the field and measure a corrected $f_{ckc}=49_{-7.8}^{+7.4}$% for Hyperion and a corrected $f_{ckc}=23_{-1.3}^{+1.2}$% for the surrounding field; a $>3\sigma$ difference. This increase in $f_{ckc}$ indicates an enhancement in the merger and interaction activity within Hyperion and matches the trend seen in other structures. The rate of merger and interactions within the field implied from our field $f_{ckc}$ measurement is well aligned with values measured from other observations in similar redshift ranges. The enhanced $f_{ckc}$ measured within Hyperion suggests that merger and interaction activity play an important role in the mass growth of galaxies in denser environments at higher z.         |

|**Abstract**|            We acquired 450 {\mu}m and 850 {\mu}m dust continuum polarization observations toward the inner region of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) as part of the B-Fields In Star-Forming Region Observations (BISTRO) survey using the POL-2 polarimeter on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. These observations encompassed three dense structures: the 20 km s{^{-1}} cloud (20MC), 50 km s{^{-1}} cloud (50MC), and circumnuclear disk (CND). Our aim is to investigate the magnetic field morphology and strength in the inner region of the CMZ using polarized dust continuum and the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The magnetic field morphology is highly ordered in all three dense regions. The plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths are {\sim}1 mG for the 20MC and the 50MC, and {\sim}2 mG for the CND. We compare the energy contributions of turbulence, gravity, and thermal motion with that of the magnetic field using the plasma {\beta}, mass-to-flux ratio, and Alfvén Mach number. The outcomes reveal the magnetic field stands out as the predominant factor within the inner region of the CMZ. The dominance of the magnetic field may explain the low star-forming rate in the CMZ. We further investigate the dust grain alignment efficiency by exploring the relationship between polarization fraction and total intensity. The results suggest that dust grains are well aligned with the magnetic fields.         |

|**Abstract**|            Understanding galactic magnetic fields is essential for interpreting feedback processes in galaxies. Despite their importance, the exact structure of these fields, particularly in galactic halos, remains unclear. Accurate descriptions are crucial for understanding the interaction between star formation and halo magnetisation. By systematically analysing the polarisation patterns in halos of nearby galaxies, we aim to deepen the understanding of the interplay between galactic magnetic fields and star formation processes. We provide an analytical description of the observed X-shaped halos. Based on radio polarimetry data, we classify the polarisation patterns of a sample of edge-on galaxies, by using a newly introduced three-class system: disc dominated, small-scale, and X-shaped. We then fit X-shaped patterns to the polarisation data for galaxies classified as X-shaped and explore links between the polarisation patterns and other physical properties of these galaxies. The classification process shows that 11 out of 18 analysed galaxies display an X-shaped polarisation pattern. Galaxies classified as disc dominated seem less efficient at forming stars than expected for their stellar mass and rotate faster than galaxies with similarly sized HI-discs. X-shape modelling reveals that the polarisation patterns are best fitted by a constant-angle model, and we observe a correlation between the X-shape opening angle and star formation rate surface density indicating the interplay between the star formation in the disc and the magnetisation of the galactic halo. The analysis of polarisation patterns in nearby galaxies reveals that most exhibit an X-shaped configuration, indicating a common magnetic field structure in galactic halos. The introduced models capture the X-shaped morphology and reveal the link between the X-shape's opening angle and star formation rate surface density.         |
