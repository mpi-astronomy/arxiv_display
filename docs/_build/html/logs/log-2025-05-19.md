|**Abstract**|            The matter cycle between gas clouds and stars in galaxies plays a crucial role in regulating galaxy evolution through feedback mechanisms. In turn, the local and global galactic environments shape the interstellar medium and provide the initial conditions for star formation, potentially affecting the properties of this small-scale matter cycle. In particular, spiral arms have been proposed to play a pivotal role in the star formation life cycle, by enhancing the gas density and triggering star formation. However, their exact role is still debated. In this paper, we investigate the role of spiral arms in the giant molecular cloud evolutionary life cycle and on the star formation process in a sample of 22 nearby spiral galaxies from the PHANGS survey. We measure the cloud lifetime, the feedback timescale, the typical distance between independent regions and the star formation efficiency in spiral arms and inter-arm regions separately. We find that the distributions of the cloud lifetime as well as the feedback timescale are similar in both environments. This result suggests that spiral arms are unlikely to play a dominant role in triggering star formation. By contrast, the star formation efficiency appears to be slightly higher in inter-arm regions compared to spiral arms.         |

|**Abstract**|            The discovery of hot Jupiters that orbit very close to their host stars has long challenged traditional models of planetary formation and migration. Characterising their atmospheric composition - mainly in the form of the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio and metallicity - can provide insights into their formation locations and evolution pathways. With JWST we can characterise the atmospheres of these types of planets more precisely than previously possible, primarily because it allows us to determine both their atmospheric oxygen and carbon composition. Here, we present a JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum from 2.8-5.1$\mu m$ of WASP-94Ab, an inflated hot Jupiter with a retrograde misaligned orbit around its F-type host star. We find a relatively cloud-free atmosphere, with absorption features of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ at detection significances of $\sim 4\sigma$ and $\sim 11\sigma$, respectively. In addition, we detect tentative evidence of CO absorption at $\sim3\sigma$, as well as hints of sulphur with the detection of H$_2$S at a $\sim 2.5\sigma$ confidence level. Our favoured equilibrium chemistry model determines a C/O ratio of $0.49^{+0.08}_{-0.13}$ for WASP-94Ab's atmosphere, which is substellar compared to the star's C/O ratio of $0.68 \pm 0.10$. The retrieved atmospheric metallicity is similar to the star's metallicity as both are $\sim 2\times$ solar. We find that this sub-stellar C/O ratio and stellar metallicity can be best explained by pebble accretion or planetesimal accretion in combination with large-distance migration of the planet.         |

|**Abstract**|            JWST has revealed a stunning population of bright galaxies at surprisingly early epochs, $z>10$, where few such sources were expected. Here we present the most distant example of this class yet -- MoM-z14, a luminous ($M_{\rm{UV}}=-20.2$) source in the COSMOS legacy field at $z_{\rm{spec}}=14.44^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ that expands the observational frontier to a mere 280 million years after the Big Bang. The redshift is confirmed with NIRSpec/prism spectroscopy through a sharp Lyman-$\alpha$ break and $\approx3\sigma$ detections of five rest-UV emission lines. The number density of bright $z_{\rm{spec}}\approx14-15$ sources implied by our "Mirage or Miracle" survey spanning $\approx350$ arcmin$^{2}$ is $>100\times$ larger ($182^{+329}_{-105}\times$) than pre-JWST consensus models. The high EWs of UV lines (${\approx}15{-}35$ Å) signal a rising star-formation history, with a ${\approx}10\times$ increase in the last 5 Myr ($\rm{SFR_{\rm{5Myr}}}/\rm{SFR_{\rm{50Myr}}}=9.9^{+3.0}_{-5.8}$). The source is extremely compact (circularized $r_{\rm{e}} = 74^{+15}_{-12}$ pc), and yet resolved, suggesting an AGN is not the dominant source of light. The steep UV slope ($\beta=-2.5^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$) implies negligible dust attenuation and a young stellar population. The absence of a strong damping wing may indicate that the immediate surroundings of MoM-z14 are partially ionized at a redshift where virtually every reionization model predicts a $\approx100\%$ neutral fraction. The nitrogen emission and highly super-solar [N/C]$>1$ hint at an abundance pattern similar to local globular clusters that may have once hosted luminous supermassive stars. Since this abundance pattern is also common among the most ancient stars born in the Milky Way, we may be directly witnessing the formation of such stars in dense clusters, connecting galaxy evolution across the entire sweep of cosmic time.         |

|**Abstract**|            We demonstrate the power of JWST-NIRCam medium-band photometry to measure emission line fluxes and study dust and star formation properties of galaxies at cosmic noon. In this work, we present photometric emission line measurements and spatially-resolved maps of H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$ for a sample of 14 galaxies at $1.3\leq z\leq 2.4$, observed by the MegaScience medium-band survey and the UNCOVER deep spectroscopic survey. We measure line fluxes directly from the medium-band photometry and compare with spectroscopic measurements from UNCOVER. We find reasonable agreement between the photometric and spectroscopic emission line fluxes for both H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$, with scatter $<0.15$ dex down to emission line equivalent widths of $10$Å. We also make a nebular dust measurement from the ratio Pa$\beta$ / H$\alpha$, finding an average nebular A$_\mathrm{V}$ of 1.4. Our photometric A$_\mathrm{V}$ measurements show a slightly larger scatter of $0.5$ magnitudes when compared to spectroscopic measurements; however, this scatter may be partially caused by aperture effects. Finally, we produce spatially resolved maps of H$\alpha$ emission, Pa$\beta$ emission, and stellar continuum. We find that offsets in H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$ emission are common, especially for galaxies with the highest A$_\mathrm{V}$, indicating dusty sub-structures. Furthermore, the correlation between H$\alpha$ and continuum emission decreases with increasing A$_\mathrm{V}$, suggesting that the dustiest objects have clumpy dust and star formation distributions. Our study demonstrates the power of medium-band photometry to directly probe emission line strengths, star formation, and dust attenuation for hundreds of galaxies in UNCOVER and thousands of galaxies in upcoming JWST medium-band surveys.         |

|**Abstract**|            Sub-parsec (sub-pc) binary supermassive black holes (BSBHs) should be common from galaxy mergers, yet direct evidence has been elusive. We present HST/WFC3IR F160W imaging for a sample of 8 candidate sub-pc BSBHs at redshifts z~0.1--0.5, as well as cross-comparison with a sample of ordinary quasars with archival HST/WFC3 IR F160W images. These 8 candidate sub-pc BSBHs were identified from multi-epoch spectroscopic surveys of quasars (including both typical quasars and those with single-peaked velocity-offset broad lines). whose broad H$\beta$ lines are significantly offset (by ~< a few hundred km/s) from the systemic redshifts. We directly test the prediction that the host galaxies of BSBHs would have a higher fraction of disturbed morphologies and younger stellar bulges from recent interactions than those of control quasars. After careful subtraction of the central quasar light, our candidate BSBH hosts show a statistically undifferentiated distribution of host asymmetry, indicative of a similar fraction of recent mergers. While a significantly larger sample is needed to place this result on a much firmer statistical ground, it opens questions as to the timescale differences between galaxy merger and BSBH formation, or the efficacy of the radial-velocity-shift--based selection of sub-pc BSBH candidates.         |

|**Abstract**|            We perform a precise calculation of the EFT conditional likelihood for large-scale structure (LSS) via the saddle-point expansion method in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG). The precision is manifested at two levels: one corresponding to the consideration of higher-order noise terms, and the other to the inclusion of contributions around the saddle points. In computing the latter, we encounter the same issue of the negative modes as in the context of false vacuum decay, which necessitates deforming the original integration contour into the combination of the steepest descent contours to ensure a convergent and real result. We demonstrate through detailed calculations that, upon the incorporation of leading-order PNG, both types of extensions introduce irreducible field-dependent contributions to the conditional likelihood. This insight motivates the systematic inclusion of additional effective terms within the forward modeling framework. Our work facilitates Bayesian forward modeling under non-Gaussian initial conditions, thereby enabling more stringent constraints on the parameters describing PNG.         |

|**Abstract**|            Recurrent small-scale eruptions are fascinating phenomena in the solar atmosphere. However, their underlying physical mechanisms remain unclear. On 2021 May 23, five recurrent jetlets (J1-J5) were observed continuously ejecting from a satellite spot located at the north edge of AR 12824. Using high-resolution, multi-wavelength data from NVST, SDO, and IRIS, we investigate the physical characteristics of these jetlets and their relationship with the satellite spot. The widths of these jetlets range from 1300 to 2900 km, their lifetimes range span 3 to 10 minutes, and their projection speeds vary from 152.8 to 406.0 km s$^{-1}$. During the eruptions, the satellite spot moved northwest at a low speed of 376 $\pm$ 12 m s$^{-1}$. Its area gradually decreased due to magnetic cancellation with surrounding positive magnetic field, resulting in an average cancellation rate of 1.3$\times$10$^{18}$ Mx hr$^{-1}$. Dark lanes that separated from the satellite spot and small pores were observed to move toward nearby these features or dark lanes with opposite polarities, eventually disappearing during the magnetic cancellation process. J4 was driven by an eruption of a micro-filament. Spectral observations revealed a redshift on the right side of J4 and a blueshift on the left side of its base, suggesting a counterclockwise rotation. The horizontal magnetic field of the satellite spot consistently exhibited a vortex structure throughout its evolution until it vanished. The nonlinear force-free field extrapolation confirms that the satellite spot serves as one footpoint of a mini-flux rope. These observations reveal that these jetlets might result from three-dimensional null-point magnetic reconnection, initiated by the continuous eruption of a mini-flux-rope or multiple mini-flux-ropes, driven by sustained magnetic cancellation.         |
