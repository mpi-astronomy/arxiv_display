|**Abstract**|            As part of the guaranteed time observations program Mid-Infrared Characterization Of Nearby Iconic galaxy Centers (MICONIC), we used the medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board of the JWST to study the nearby merger NGC6240. We aim to characterise the dual active galactic nuclei (AGN), the ionised gas outflows and the main properties of the interstellar medium over a mapped area of 6.6"x7.7". We obtained integral field spectroscopic mid-infrared data of NGC6240, resolving both nuclei for the first time in the full 5-28{\mu}m spectral range. We modelled the emission lines through a kinematic decomposition, finding that the fine-structure lines in the southern (S) nucleus are broader than for the northern (N) nucleus (full width at half maximum of $\geq$1500 vs ~700 km s^{-1} on average). High excitation lines, such as [NeV], [NeVI], and [MgV], are clearly detected in the N nucleus. In the S nucleus, the same lines can be detected but only after a decomposition of the PAH features in the integrated spectrum, due to a combination of a strong mid-IR continuum, the broad emission lines, and the intense star formation (SF). The SF is distributed all over the mapped FoV of 3.5kpc x 4.1kpc (projected), with the maximum located around the S nucleus. Both nuclear regions appear to be connected by a bridge region detected with all the emission lines. Based on the observed MRS line ratios and the high velocity dispersion ({\sigma}~600 km s^{-1}), shocks are also dominating the emission in this system. We detected the presence of outflows as a bubble north-west from the N nucleus and at the S nucleus. We estimated a ionised mass outflow rate of 1.4$\pm$0.3 M yr^{-1} and 1.8$\pm$0.2 M yr^{-1}, respectively. Given the derived kinetic power of these outflows, both the AGN and the starburst could have triggered them. [Abridged]         |

|**Abstract**|            ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) are an abundant high-redshift population newly discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). They are characterized by a red color in the rest-frame optical band, compact morphology, and broad Balmer emission lines (${\rm FWHM} \gtrsim 1000~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) that suggest an AGN nature. Using a method of pixel-by-pixel color selection and relaxing the compactness criteria, we identify three of the first dual LRD candidates in the COSMOS-Web survey with projected separations of $0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}2-0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}4$ (1-2 pkpc at their photometric redshifts). A comparison between existing LRD samples and mock data reveals that the projected separations of these dual LRD candidates are unlikely to result from chance projections of objects at different redshifts. In one case (CW-B5-15958), the dual LRD includes two bright sources ($m_{\rm F444W}=24.3$ and $24.8$) with characteristic V-shape spectral energy distribution (SEDs) and photometric redshifts consistent with each other. We find that CW-B5-15958 has a faint off-centered component and a companion galaxy. In the other two dual systems, the brighter LRD exhibits a V-shape SED, while the fainter LRD ($m_{\rm F444W}\gtrsim26$) is undetected in both F115W and F150W. These discoveries suggest that the angular auto-correlation function (ACF) of LRDs exhibits a significant excess ($\sim3\times10^2$ times) on sub-arcsec (kilo-parsec) separations compared to the extrapolation of a power-law ACF of JWST-found AGNs measured over $10^{\prime\prime}-100^{\prime\prime}$. Follow-up spectroscopic confirmation of their redshifts and the construction of a larger sample are essential to advance our understanding of the evolution of supermassive black holes and the importance of mergers in the early universe.         |

|**Abstract**|            Dark matter halos with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) experience a unique evolutionary phenomenon, in that their central regions eventually collapse to high density through the runaway gravothermal process after initially forming a large and low-density core. When coupled with orbital evolution, this is expected to naturally produce a large diversity in dark-matter halos' inner mass distribution, potentially explaining the diversity problem of dwarf galaxies. However, it remains unknown how the diversity in SIDM dark-matter halos propagates to the more easily observed luminous matter at the center of the halo, especially the stellar component. In this work, we use idealized N-body simulations with two species of particles (dark matter and stars) to study the response of the stellar properties of field and satellite dwarf galaxies to SIDM evolution and orbital effects on their halos. Galaxies' stellar components, including galaxy size, mass-to-light ratio, and stellar velocity dispersion, display a much larger scatter in SIDM than the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. Importantly, we find signs of universality in the evolution pathways, or ``tidal tracks'', of SIDM dwarf satellites, which are physically interpretable and potentially parameterizable. This type of tidal-track model can be layered onto larger-scale, cosmological simulations to reconstruct the evolution of populations of SIDM dwarfs in cases where high-resolution simulations of galaxies are otherwise prohibitively expensive.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the discovery of 14 new (and recovery of 4 known) low accretion rate magnetic white dwarfs in post-common envelope binaries that emit strong cyclotron emission using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) light curves, doubling the known sample size. In addition, we discovered a candidate magnetic period bouncer and recovered three known ones. We confirmed the presence of cyclotron emission using low-resolution spectra in 19 objects. Using the ZTF light curves, follow-up spectra, and the spectral energy distribution, we measured the orbital period, magnetic field strength, and white dwarf temperature of each system. Although the phase-folded light curves have diverse shapes and show a much larger variability amplitude, we show that their intrinsic properties (e.g. period distribution, magnetic field strength) are similar to those of previously known systems. The diversity in light curve shapes can be explained by differences in the optical depth of the accretion spot and geometric differences, the inclination angle and the magnetic spot latitude. The evolutionary states of the longer period binaries are somewhat uncertain but are vary; we found systems consistent with being pre-polars, detached polars, or low-state polars. In addition, we discovered two new low-state polars that likely have brown dwarf companions and could be magnetic period bouncers.         |

|**Abstract**|            In the early stages of planetary system formation, young exoplanets gravitationally interact with their surrounding environments and leave observable signatures on protoplanetary disks. Among these structures, a pair of nearly symmetric spiral arms can be driven by a giant protoplanet. For the double-spiraled SAO 206462 protoplanetary disk, we obtained three epochs of observations spanning 7 yr using the Very Large Telescope's SPHERE instrument in near-infrared $J$-band polarized light. By jointly measuring the motion of the two spirals at three epochs, we obtained a rotation rate of $-0.85^\circ\pm0.05^\circ~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. This rate corresponds to a protoplanet at $66\pm3$ au on a circular orbit dynamically driving both spirals. The derived location agrees with the gap in ALMA dust-continuum observations, indicating that the spiral driver may also carve the observed gap. What is more, a dust filament at $\sim$63 au observed by ALMA coincides with the predicted orbit of the spiral-arm-driving protoplanet. This double-spiraled system is an ideal target for protoplanet imaging.         |
