|**Abstract**|            We present MIRI/JWST medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS) and imaging (MIRIM) of B14-65666, a Lyman-break and interacting galaxy at redshift $z$=7.15. We detect the H$\alpha$ line emission in this system, revealing a spatially-resolved structure of the H$\alpha$ emitting gas, which consists of two distinct galaxies, E and W, at a projected distance of 0.4". Galaxy E is very compact in the rest-frame UV, while W galaxy is more extended, showing a clumpy structure reminiscent of a tidal tail. The total H$\alpha$ luminosity implies that the system is forming stars at a Star Formation Rate (SFR) of 76$\pm$8 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and 30$\pm$4 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for E and W, respectively. The ionizing photon production efficiency is within the range measured in galaxies at similar redshifts. The high values derived for the H$\alpha$ equivalent widths (EW) and the distinct locations of the E and W galaxies in the $\log(\zeta_\mathrm{ion}$) $-$ EW (H$\alpha$) plane, indicate that the system is dominated by a young (less than 10 Myr) stellar population. The overall spectral energy distribution suggests that in addition to a young stellar population, the two galaxies may have mature stellar population and very different dust attenuation. The derived SFR and stellar masses identify the two galaxies as going through a starburst phase. The kinematics of the ionized gas traced by the H$\alpha$ line show a velocity difference of 175 $\pm$ 28 km s$^{-1}$ between the two components of B14-65666. The in-depth study of systems like B14-65666 reveal how galaxy mergers in the early Universe drive intense star formation, shape the interstellar medium, and influence the buildup of stellar mass, just 700 $-$ 800 Myr after the Big Bang.         |

|**Abstract**|            Studying the composition and origin of the inner region of our Galaxy -- the "Galactic bulge" -- is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way and other galaxies. We present new observational constraints based on a sample of around 18,000 stars in the inner Galaxy, combining Gaia DR3 RVS and APOGEE DR17 spectroscopy. Gaia-RVS complements APOGEE by improving sampling of the metallicity, [Fe/H] in the -2.0 to -0.5 dex range. This work marks the first application of Gaia-RVS spectroscopy to the bulge region, enabled by a novel machine learning approach (hybrid-CNN) that derives stellar parameters from intermediate-resolution spectra with precision comparable to APOGEE's infrared data. We performed full orbit integrations using a barred Galactic potential and applied orbital frequency analysis to disentangle the stellar populations in the inner Milky Way. For the first time, traced by the field stars, we are able to robustly identify the long-sought pressure supported bulge. We show this stellar population to be chemically and kinematically distinct from the other main components co-existing in the same region. The spheroidal bulge has a metallicity distribution function (MDF) peak at around -0.70 dex extending to solar value, is dominated by a high-[alpha/Fe] population with almost no dependency on metallicity, consistent with very rapid early formation, predating the thick disc and the bar. We find evidence that the bar has influenced the dynamics of the spheroidal bulge, introducing a mild triaxiality and radial extension. We identify a group of stars on X4 orbits, likely native to the early spheroid, as this population mimics the chemistry of the spheroidal bulge, with a minor contamination from the more metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -1.0) halo. We find the inner-thick disc to be kinematically hotter (mean Vphi ~125 km/s) than the local-thick disc. ...         |

|**Abstract**|            The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V (SDSS-V) is pioneering panoptic spectroscopy: it is the first all-sky, multi-epoch, optical-to-infrared spectroscopic survey. SDSS-V is mapping the sky with multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) at telescopes in both hemispheres (the 2.5-m Sloan Foundation Telescope at Apache Point Observatory and the 100-inch du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory), where 500 zonal robotic fiber positioners feed light from a wide-field focal plane to an optical (R$\sim 2000$, 500 fibers) and a near-infrared (R$\sim 22,000$, 300 fibers) spectrograph. In addition to these MOS capabilities, the survey is pioneering ultra wide-field ($\sim$ 4000~deg$^2$) integral field spectroscopy enabled by a new dedicated facility (LVM-I) at Las Campanas Observatory, where an integral field spectrograph (IFS) with 1801 lenslet-coupled fibers arranged in a 0.5 degree diameter hexagon feeds multiple R$\sim$4000 optical spectrographs that cover 3600-9800 angstroms. SDSS-V's hardware and multi-year survey strategy are designed to decode the chemo-dynamical history of the Milky Way Galaxy and tackle fundamental open issues in stellar physics in its Milky Way Mapper program, trace the growth physics of supermassive black holes in its Black Hole Mapper program, and understand the self-regulation mechanisms and the chemical enrichment of galactic ecosystems at the energy-injection scale in its Local Volume Mapper program. The survey is well-timed to multiply the scientific output from major all-sky space missions. The SDSS-V MOS programs began robotic operations in 2021; IFS observations began in 2023 with the completion of the LVM-I facility. SDSS-V builds upon decades of heritage of SDSS's pioneering advances in data analysis, collaboration spirit, infrastructure, and product deliverables in astronomy.         |

|**Abstract**|            Mapping the local and distant Universe is key to our understanding of it. For decades, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has made a concerted effort to map millions of celestial objects to constrain the physical processes that govern our Universe. The most recent and fifth generation of SDSS (SDSS-V) is organized into three scientific ``mappers". Milky Way Mapper (MWM) that aims to chart the various components of the Milky Way and constrain its formation and assembly, Black Hole Mapper (BHM), which focuses on understanding supermassive black holes in distant galaxies across the Universe, and Local Volume Mapper (LVM), which uses integral field spectroscopy to map the ionized interstellar medium in the local group. This paper describes and outlines the scope and content for the nineteenth data release (DR19) of SDSS and the most substantial to date in SDSS-V. DR19 is the first to contain data from all three mappers. Additionally, we also describe nine value added catalogs (VACs) that enhance the science that can be conducted with the SDSS-V data. Finally, we discuss how to access SDSS DR19 and provide illustrative examples and tutorials.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present Kurucz-a1, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that emulates 1D stellar atmosphere models under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), addressing a critical bottleneck in differentiable stellar spectroscopy. By incorporating hydrostatic equilibrium as a physical constraint during training, Kurucz-a1 creates a differentiable atmospheric structure solver that maintains physical consistency while achieving computational efficiency. Kurucz-a1 can achieve superior hydrostatic equilibrium and more consistent with the solar observed spectra compared to ATLAS-12 itself, demonstrating the advantages of modern optimization techniques. Combined with modern differentiable radiative transfer codes, this approach enables data-driven optimization of universal physical parameters across diverse stellar populations-a capability essential for next-generation stellar astrophysics.         |

|| J.-G. Zhang, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-10*|
|*Comments*| *13 pages, 3 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            The dispersion measure (DM) analysis of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) has accounted for all cosmic baryons but remains limited by systematic uncertainties from various parameter degeneracies. We show that the prominent degeneracy between the baryon density ($\Omega_{\rm b}$) and the Hubble constant ($H_0$) can be disentangled through an independent $H_0$ value uniquely inferred from the absolute luminosity distance measurements of gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens. By combining $104$ localized FRBs with $47$ GW events, we obtain a robust, late-Universe measurement of \ob $=0.0488\pm0.0064$ ($1\sigma$), in concordance with early-Universe observations of CMB + BBN. Notably, incorporating GW data helps not only avoid biases induced by the $H_0$ tension, but also mitigate those from the parameters of diffuse baryon fraction and DM distribution models. Although the current precision ($\sim 13\%$) is limited by sample size, the growing detections of both FRBs and GWs will make their synergy a powerful probe of low-redshift cosmology.         |
