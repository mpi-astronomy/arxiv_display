|**Abstract**| Stars formed with initial mass over 50 Msun are very rare today, but they are thought to be more common in the early universe. The fates of those early, metal-poor, massive stars are highly uncertain. Most are expected to directly collapse to black holes, while some may explode as a result of rotationally powered engines or the pair-creation instability. We present the chemical abundances of J0931+0038, a nearby low-mass star identified in early followup of SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper, which preserves the signature of unusual nucleosynthesis from a massive star in the early universe. J0931+0038 has relatively high metallicity ([Fe/H] = -1.76 +/- 0.13) but an extreme odd-even abundance pattern, with some of the lowest known abundance ratios of [N/Fe], [Na/Fe], [K/Fe], [Sc/Fe], and [Ba/Fe]. The implication is that a majority of its metals originated in a single extremely metal-poor nucleosynthetic source. An extensive search through nucleosynthesis predictions finds a clear preference for progenitors with initial mass > 50 Msun, making J0931+0038 one of the first observational constraints on nucleosynthesis in this mass range. However the full abundance pattern is not matched by any models in the literature. J0931+0038 thus presents a challenge for the next generation of nucleosynthesis models and motivates study of high-mass progenitor stars impacted by convection, rotation, jets, and/or binary companions. Though rare, more examples of unusual early nucleosynthesis in metal-poor stars should be found in upcoming large spectroscopic surveys. |

|**Abstract**| Isolated galaxies are the ideal reference sample to study the galaxy structure minimising potential environmental effects. We selected a complete sample of 14 nearby, late-type, highly inclined ($i\geq80^{\circ}$), isolated galaxies from the Catalogue of Isolated Galaxies (CIG) which offers a vertical view of their disc structure. We aim to study extraplanar Diffuse Ionized Gas (eDIG) by comparing the old and young disc components traced by near-infrared (NIR) and Ultraviolet (UV) imaging with the H$\alpha$ emission structure. We obtained H$\alpha$ monochromatic maps from the Fabry-Perot (FP) interferometry, while the old and young discs structures are obtained from the photometric analysis of the 2MASS K$_{s}$-band, and GALEX NUV and FUV images, thereby identifying the stellar disc and whether the eDIG is present. The H$\alpha$ morphology is peculiar in CIG 71, CIG 183, CIG 593 showing clear asymmetries. In general, geometric parameters (isophotal position angle, peak light distribution, inclination) measured from H$\alpha$, UV and NIR show minimal differences (e.g. $\Delta i\leq\pm$10$^{\circ}$), suggesting that interaction does not play a significant role in shaping the morphology, as expected in isolated galaxies. From H$\alpha$ maps, the eDIG was detected vertically in 11 out of 14 galaxies. Although the fraction of eDIG is high, the comparison between our sample and a generic sample of inclined spirals suggests that the phenomenon is uncorrelated to the galaxy environment. As suggested by the extraplanar UV emission found in 13 out of 14 galaxies the star formation extends well beyond the disc defined by the H$\alpha$ map. |

|**Abstract**| Atmospheric photochemistry on Titan continuously transforms methane and nitrogen gases into various organic compounds. This study explores the fate of these molecules when they land on Titan's surface. Our analytical exploration reveals that most simple organics found in Titan's atmosphere, including all nitriles, triple-bonded hydrocarbons, and benzene, land as solids. Only a few compounds are in the liquid phase, while only ethylene remains gaseous. For the simple organics that land as solids, we further examine their interactions with Titan's lake liquids. Utilizing principles of buoyancy, we found that flotation can be achieved via porosity-induced (25-60% porosity) or capillary force-induced buoyancy for HCN ices on ethane-rich lakes. Otherwise, these ices would sink and become lakebed sediments. By evaluating the timescale of flotation, our findings suggest that porosity-induced flotation of millimeter-sized and larger sediments is the only plausible mechanism for floating solids to explain the transient "magic islands" phenomena on Titan's lakes. |

|**Abstract**| The diffusion of water molecules through mesoporous dust of amorphous carbon (a-C) is a key process in the evolution of prestellar, protostellar, and protoplanetary dust, as well as in that of comets. It also plays a role in the formation of planets. Given the absence of data on this process, we experimentally studied the isothermal diffusion of water molecules desorbing from water ice buried at the bottom of a mesoporous layer of aggregated a-C nanoparticles, a material analogous to protostellar and cometary dust. We used infrared spectroscopy to monitor diffusion in low temperature (160 to 170 K) and pressure (6 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ to 8 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ Pa) conditions. Fick's first law of diffusion allowed us to derive diffusivity values on the order of 10$^{-2}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$, which we linked to Knudsen diffusion. Water vapor molecular fluxes ranged from 5 $\times$ 10$^{12}$ to 3 $\times$ 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ for thicknesses of the ice-free porous layer ranging from 60 to 1900 nm. Assimilating the layers of nanoparticles to assemblies of spheres, we attributed to this cosmic dust analog of porosity 0.80-0.90 a geometry correction factor, similar to the tortuosity factor of tubular pore systems, between 0.94 and 2.85. Applying the method to ices and refractory particles of other compositions will provides us with other useful data. |
