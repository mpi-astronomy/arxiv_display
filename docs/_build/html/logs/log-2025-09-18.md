|**Abstract**|            The recently identified Gaia population of main-sequence--white dwarf (MS+WD) binaries at separations of ${\sim}\,1~{\rm AU}$, often with moderate eccentricities, is not readily reproduced by binary population synthesis models. Barium stars represent a closely related population whose enrichment in $s$-process elements both confirms the presence of a WD companion and attests to past binary interaction. It also indicates that mass transfer occurred at least during the late- and post-AGB phases of the WD progenitor, when $s$-process elements are dredged up. In this work, we further explore the connection between the astrometrically identified Gaia MS+WD binaries and the classical barium star population. To achieve this, we used high-resolution FEROS spectroscopy to measure abundances for 30 Gaia DR3 non-single-star binaries, identifying 10 as Ba-enriched. Together with our recent analysis of archival GALAH data, this yields a sample of 38 barium dwarfs with dynamically measured WD masses, compared to only 6 previously known systems with known WD masses at these separations. We find that, in cases where metallicity is sufficiently low to facilitate efficient $s$-process production, barium and yttrium enrichment is often detected. This enrichment is also identified in eccentric systems, suggesting that post-AGB mass transfer mechanisms are capable of pumping eccentricity into the orbit or occur without erasing it. Our results indicate that the Gaia MS+WD binaries trace the population from which barium stars emerge. Treating the large Gaia-discovered population as an extension of known $s$-process enriched dwarfs opens an avenue to empirically constrain their formation and evolution.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report the discovery of a new directly-imaged brown dwarf companion with Keck/NIRC2+pyWFS around a nearby mid-type M~dwarf LSPM~J1446+4633 (hereafter J1446). The $L'$-band contrast ($4.5\times10^{-3}$) is consistent with a $\sim20-60\ M_{\rm Jup}$ object at 1--10~Gyr and our two-epoch NIRC2 data suggest a $\sim30\%$ ($\sim3.1\sigma)$ variability in its $L'$-band flux. We incorporated Gaia DR3 non-single-star catalog into the orbital fitting by combining the Subaru/IRD RV monitoring results, NIRC2 direct imaging results, and Gaia proper motion acceleration. As a result, we derive ${59.8}_{-1.4}^{+1.5}\ M_{\rm Jup}$ and $\approx4.3~{\rm au}$ for the dynamical mass and the semi-major axis of the companion J1446B, respectively. J1446B is one of the intriguing late-T~dwarfs showing variability at $L'$-band for future atmospheric studies with the constrained dynamical mass. Because the J1446 system is accessible with various observation techniques such as astrometry, direct imaging, and high-resolution spectroscopy including radial velocity measurement, it has a potential as a great benchmark system to improve our understanding for cool dwarfs.         |

|**Abstract**|            Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread in the interstellar medium (ISM) of Solar metallicity galaxies, where they play a critical role in ISM heating, cooling, and reprocessing stellar radiation. The PAH fraction, the abundance of PAHs relative to total dust mass, is a key parameter in ISM physics. Using JWST and MUSE observations of 42 galaxies from the PHANGS survey, we analyze the PAH fraction in over 17 000 H II regions spanning a gas-phase oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) = 8.0-8.8 (Z ~ 0.2-1.3 Zsun), and ~400 isolated supernova remnants (SNRs). We find a significantly lower PAH fraction toward H II regions compared to a reference sample of diffuse ISM areas at matched metallicity. At 12+log(O/H) > 8.2, the PAH fraction toward H II regions is strongly anti-correlated with the local ionization parameter, suggesting that PAH destruction is correlated with ionized gas and/or hydrogen-ionizing UV radiation. At lower metallicities, the PAH fraction declines steeply in both H II regions and the diffuse ISM, likely reflecting less efficient PAH formation in metal-poor environments. Carefully isolating dust emission from the vicinity of optically-identified supernova remnants, we see evidence for selective PAH destruction from measurements of lower PAH fractions, which is, however, indistinguishable at ~50 pc scales. Overall, our results point to ionizing radiation as the dominant agent of PAH destruction within H II regions, with metallicity playing a key role in their global abundance in galaxies.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the first near-infrared interferometric data of a QSO at z=4. The K-band observations were performed with GRAVITY+ on the VLTI using all 4 UTs, detecting a differential phase signal that traces the spatially resolved kinematics for both the H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$ lines in the broad line region. We fit the two lines simultaneously with an updated model that includes distinct rotating and conical outflowing components. We find that more than 80\% of the HI line emission from the BLR originates in an outflow with a velocity up to $10^4$ km s$^{-1}$. This is oriented so that our line of sight is along an edge of the conical structure, which produces the prominent blue wing on the line profile. A combination of anisotropic line emission and mid-plane opacity lead to the single-sided phase signal. The model is able to qualitatively match both the outflowing CIV line profile and the systemic OI fluorescent emission. The derived black hole mass of $8\times10^8$ M$_\odot$ is the highest redshift black hole mass measurement to date obtained directly from BLR dynamics. It is an order of magnitude lower than that inferred from various single epoch scaling relations, and implies that the accretion is highly super-Eddington. With reference to recent simulations, the data suggest that this QSO is emitting close to its radiative limit in a regime where strong outflows are expected around a polar conical region.         |

|**Abstract**|            The search for atmospheres on rocky exoplanets is a crucial step in understanding the processes driving atmosphere formation, retention, and loss. Past studies have revealed the existence of planets interior to the radius valley with densities lower than would be expected for pure-rock compositions, indicative of the presence of large volatile inventories which could facilitate atmosphere retention. Here we present an analysis of the JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum of the warm ($T_\mathrm{eq,{A_B}=0}$ = 569 K) super-Earth TOI-270 b ($R_\mathrm{p}$ = 1.306 $R_\oplus$), captured alongside the transit of TOI-270 d. The JWST white light-curve transit depth updates TOI-270 b's density to $\rho_\mathrm{p}$ = 3.7 $\pm$ 0.5 g/cm$^3$, inconsistent at 4.4$\sigma$ with an Earth-like composition. Instead, the planet is best explained by a non-zero, percent-level water mass fraction, possibly residing on the surface or stored within the interior. The JWST transmission spectrum shows possible spectroscopic evidence for the presence of this water as part of an atmosphere on TOI-270 b, favoring a H$_2$O-rich steam atmosphere model over a flat spectrum ($\ln\mathcal{B}$ = $0.3-3.2$, inconclusive to moderate), with the exact significance depending on whether an offset parameter between the NIRSpec detectors is included. We leverage the transit of the twice-larger TOI-270 d crossing the stellar disk almost simultaneously to rule out the alternative hypothesis that the transit-light-source effect could have caused the water feature in TOI-270 b's observed transmission spectrum. Planetary evolution modeling furthermore shows that TOI-270 b could sustain a significant atmosphere on Gyr timescales, despite its high stellar irradiation, if it formed with a large initial volatile inventory.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) forest at $z \sim 5$ offers a primary probe to constrain the history of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), retaining thermal and ionization signatures imprinted by the reionization process. In this work, we present a new inference framework based on JAX that combines forward-modeled Ly$\alpha$ forest observables with differentiable neural emulators and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). We construct a dataset of 501 low-resolution simulations generated with user-defined reionization histories and compute a set of 1D Ly$\alpha$ power spectra and model-dependent covariance matrices. We then train two independent neural emulators that achieve sub-percent errors across relevant scales and combine them with HMC to efficiently perform parameter estimation. We validate this framework by applying it to a suite of mock observations, demonstrating that the true parameters are reliably recovered. While this work is limited by the low resolution of the simulations used, our results highlight the potential of this method for inferring the reionization history from high-redshift Ly$\alpha$ forest measurements. Future improvements in our reionization models will further enhance its ability to extract constraints from observational datasets.         |

|**Abstract**|            We have analyzed the GeV gamma-ray emission in the region of the supernova remnant (SNR) Kes 78 using $\sim$16.7 years of Fermi-LAT observations and found that the catalog sources 4FGL J1852.4+0037e and 4FGL J1851.8$-$0007c are better represented as two extended sources modeled as `2Ext'. One of them, designated as E2, is located at R.A.$=282.86^\circ$, Dec.$=-0.11^\circ$ with the 68\% containment radius $R_{68} = 0.31^\circ$, and is detected with a significance of 15.2$\sigma$ in the 0.2--500 GeV energy range. The gamma-ray emission of source E2 is well described by a log-parabola (LogP) spectral model with spectral index $\Gamma$ = 1.2 and curvature $\beta$ = 0.3. The fitting with electron-proton number ratio $K_{\rm ep}=0.01$ indicates that the GeV emission of source E2 is dominated by hadronic emission. Given the dense molecular environment surrounding the middle-aged SNR Kes 78, the hadronic scenario provides a natural explanation for the observed GeV emission. The extended source E2 can also be replaced with two point sources. One of them, designated as PTS1, is coincident with the newly discovered PSR J1852$-$0002g within the 68\% positional uncertainty circle, indicating a possible gamma-ray contribution from this PSR. The gamma-ray spectrum of source PTS1 can be well described by a LogP spectral shape. The synchro-curvature radiation model provides a satisfactory spectral fit for source PTS1, suggesting that some of the GeV emission from the Kes 78 region might possibly originate from the magnetosphere of PSR J1852$-$0002g.         |

|**Abstract**|            Submillimeter astronomy is poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Universe by revealing cosmic phenomena hidden from optical and near-infrared observations, particularly those associated with interstellar dust, molecular gas, and star formation. The Xue-shan-mu-chang 15-meter submillimeter telescope (XSMT-15m), to be constructed at a premier high-altitude site (4813 m) in Qinghai, China, marks a major milestone for Chinese astronomy, establishing the China mainland's first independently developed, world-class submillimeter facility. Equipped with state-of-the-art instruments, XSMT-15m will address a diverse range of frontier scientific questions spanning extragalactic astronomy, Galactic structure, time-domain astrophysics, and astrochemistry. In synergy with current and forthcoming observatories, XSMT-15m will illuminate the formation and evolution of galaxies, unravel the physical and chemical processes shaping the interstellar medium, and explore transient phenomena in the submillimeter regime. These capabilities will advance our understanding across extragalactic astronomy, Galactic ecology, astrochemistry, and time-domain astrophysics, inaugurating a new era for submillimeter research in China and the northern hemisphere.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2025-09-18*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            Improved low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories would unlock study of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, binary black hole eccentricity, and provide early warnings for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star mergers. Today's mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10--30Hz band by over 30x, and up to 100x in sub-bands surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future GW observatories, and more broadly instrumentation and control systems.         |

|**Abstract**|            With the rise of the integral field spectroscopy, we are currently dealing with large amounts of spatially resolved data, whose analysis has become challenging, especially when observing complex objects such as nearby galaxies. We aim to develop a method to automatically separate different physical regions within the central parts (1"~160 pc, on average) of galaxies. This can allow us to better understand the systems, and provide an initial characterisation of the main ionisation sources affecting its evolution. We have developed an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to analyse data cubes based on spectral similarity. It clusters together spaxels with similar spectra, which is useful to disentangle between different physical processes. We have applied this method to a sample of 15 nearby (distances <100 Mpc) galaxies, 7 from the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS) and 8 archival sources, all observed with the medium resolution spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board of the JWST. From the clusters, we computed their median spectrum and measured the line and continuum properties. We used these measurements to train random forest models and create several empirical mid-IR diagnostic diagrams for the MRS channel 3 wavelength range, including among others the bright [Ne II], [Ne III], and [Ne V] lines, several H2 transitions, and PAH features. The clustering technique allows to differentiate emission coming from an AGN, the disc, and star forming regions in galaxies, and other composite regions, potentially ionised by several sources simultaneously. This is supported by the results from the empirical diagnostic diagrams, that are indeed able to separate physically distinct regions. This innovative method serves as a tool to identify regions of interest in any data cube prior to an in-depth analysis of the sources. [abridged]         |
