|**Abstract**|            We characterize two candidate cool galactic outflows in two relatively low mass, highly inclined Virgo cluster galaxies: NGC4424 and NGC4694. Previous analyses of observations using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) carbon monoxide (CO) line emission maps did not classify these sources as cool outflow hosts. Using new high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, JWST mid-infrared photometry in the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-tracing F770W band, we identify extended structures present off of the stellar disk. The identified structures are bright in the MIRI F770W and F2100W bands, suggesting they include PAHs as well as other dust grains. As PAHs have been shown to be destroyed in hot, ionized gas, these structures are likely to be outflows of cool (T$\leq 10^4$K) gas. This work represents an exciting possibility for using mid infrared observations to identify and measure outflows in lower mass, lower star formation galaxies.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Rosette Nebula is a well-known H II region shaped by the interaction of gas with the OB stars of the NGC 2244 stellar association. Located within the remnant of a giant molecular cloud, it exhibits a complex structure of ionized gas, molecular material, dust, and embedded clusters. In October 2023, the region was observed as part of the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM) integral field spectroscopy survey. Covering a radius of approximately 1 degree, the dataset comprises 33,326 spectra with spatially resolved information spanning 390 - 980 nm. We present a structural analysis of the ionized, molecular, and dusty components using multi-wavelength observations: optical spectroscopy from SDSS-V LVM, 12CO emission from PMO/MWISP (sub-millimeter), and dust emission from WISE (12 micron) and Herschel (far-infrared). These datasets were complemented with the positions of ionizing stars to study emission structures traced by H alpha, H beta, [O III], [N II], and [S II], as well as the spatial distribution of line ratios (H alpha/H beta, [O III]/H beta, [N II]/H alpha, and [S II]/H alpha) relative to the surrounding molecular cloud. Our analysis reveals interaction zones between ionized and neutral gas, including filaments, globules, and dense regions with or without ongoing star formation. Radial and quadrant-based flux profiles further highlight morphological and ionization variations, supporting the scenario in which the Rosette Nebula evolved from a non-homogeneous molecular cloud with a thin, sheet-like structure.         |

|| S.-H. Zhou, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-09-16*|
|*Comments*| *13 pages, 4 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            Early JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of high-redshift candidate massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 7$, and recent DESI measurements show a preference for dynamical dark energy, which together present a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In this work, we jointly analyze high-redshift galaxy data from JWST, baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI DR2, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and ACT, measuring the total neutrino mass $\sum m_{\nu}$. We consider three dark energy models ($\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM) and three mass hierarchies. Our results indicate that in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, adding JWST data to CMB+DESI tightens the upper limit of $\sum m_{\nu}$ by about $5.8\%-10.2\%$, and we obtain $\sum m_{\nu} < 0.167~\mathrm{eV}$ ($2\sigma$) in the normal hierarchy (NH) case. Furthermore, JWST also offers indicative lower limits on star formation efficiency parameter of $f_{*,10} \gtrsim 0.146-0.161$. Bayesian evidence weakly favors the $w_0w_a$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model relative to the $\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model using CMB+DESI+JWST data. These results suggest that the joint analysis of high-redshift JWST data and low-redshift DESI data provides compelling constraints on neutrino mass and merits further investigation.         |

|**Abstract**|            Solar white-light flares (WLFs) have been observed since 1859, but their occurrence rate is not yet fully understood. The physical properties of WLFs in super active regions (SARs) are also well worth investigating. With full-disk images at 3600 Å (in the Balmer continuum) from the White-light Solar Telescope (WST) on board the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory, we here study the M- and X-class WLFs occurring in SAR NOAA 13664/13697 (a same region in two solar Carrington rotations) during May/June 2024. 48 WLFs at 3600 Å are identified from 89 available samples with an occurrence rate of 53.9%, which is much higher than that (23.9%) of a longterm-continuous data set from October 2022 to May 2023 in our previous work (Jing et al. 2024). In particular, with an additional sample of over 730 M- and X-class flares from October 2022 to June 2024, we find that the occurrence rate of WLFs shows a good correlation with the solar cycle represented by sunspot counts. As regards the properties of the emission at 3600 Å, the WLFs in SAR NOAA 13664/13697 have some different characteristics, say, a longer duration but a weaker relative enhancement and a smaller brightening area compared with the previous long-term-continuous sample. We also find that for WLFs in NOAA 13664/13697 the relation between the duration and energy at 3600 Å is described by a power-law with index of 0.35, which is similar to the results found for superflares in Sun-like stars (Kowalski 2024). All these help us understand the solar WLFs in SARs and also provide important insights into the superflares on Sun-like stars.         |

|| N. Zimmermann, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-09-16*|
|*Comments*| *24 pages, 13 figures, 8 tables, submitted to A&A*|
|**Abstract**|            We select galaxy cluster candidates from the high-redshift (BEST_Z > 0.9) end of the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) galaxy cluster catalogue, for which we obtain moderately deep J-band imaging data with the OMEGA2000 camera at the 3.5m telescope of the Calar Alto Observatory. We include J-band data of four additional targets obtained with the three-channel camera at the 2m Fraunhofer telescope at the Wendelstein Observatory. We complement the new J-band photometric catalogue with forced photometry in the i- and z-bands of the tenth data release of the Legacy Survey (LSDR10) to derive the radial colour distribution around the eRASS1 clusters. Without assuming a priori to find a cluster red sequence at a specific colour, we try to find a radially weighted colour over-density to confirm the presence of high-redshift optical counterparts for the X-ray emission. We compare our confirmation with optical properties derived in earlier works based on LSDR10 data to refine the existing high-redshift cluster confirmation of eROSITA-selected clusters. We attempt to calibrate the colour-redshift-relation including the new J-band data by comparing our obtained photometric redshift estimate with the spectroscopic redshift of a confirmed, optically selected, high-redshift galaxy cluster. We confirm 9 out of 18 of the selected galaxy cluster candidates with a radial over-density of similar coloured galaxies for which we provide a photometric redshift estimate. We can report an increase in the relative colour measurement precision from 8% to 4% when including J-band data. In conclusion, our findings indicate a not insignificant spurious contaminant fraction at the high-redshift end (BEST_Z > 0.9) of the eROSITA/eRASS1 galaxy cluster catalogue, as well as it underlines the necessity for wide and deep near infrared imaging data for confirmation and characterisation of high-$z$ galaxy clusters.         |

|| S. Lin, et al. -- incl., <mark>F. Xu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-09-16*|
|*Comments*| *16 pages, 8 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJL*|
|**Abstract**|            We report the discovery of a dense molecular ring-like structure in a dense (10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$), cold (pc-scale CO depletion at a factor of 5), and young (10$^4$ year) star-forming region G34.74-0.12, revealed by C$^{18}$O (2-1), HNC (1-0), and N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The ring-like structure is redshifted with respect to the clump, spanning from $V_{\rm sys,lsr} + 0.9$ to $V_{\rm sys,lsr} + 2.9$ km s$^{-1}$, with a total mass of 109 $M_{\odot}$. It is spatially coincident with 1.3 mm and 3.0 mm dust continuum emission from cores, and several protostellar outflows. However, no free-free emission or H\textsc{ii} region is detected in association with this structure. With a slow expansion speed indicated by the position-velocity diagram, this ring structure differs from rings previously identified in more evolved star-forming regions. Possible explanations for the ring-like structure include a relic wind-blown bubble produced by a deeply embedded young stellar object, a hollow cavity formed by cloud-cloud interactions, a gas ring resulting from a temperature gradient, or a line-of-sight superposition of multiple outflows or dense clouds. This discovery offers a rare observational glimpse into the earliest dynamical processes involved in massive star formation.         |

|| H. Zhao, B. Chen, <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-09-16*|
|*Comments*| *12 pages, 1 table, 3 figures, accepted for publication in ApJL*|
|**Abstract**|            Recent observations have revealed that dust is widespread and abundant in galaxies up to $z\,{\backsimeq}\,8$, significantly influencing their appearance and spectral properties. In the early Universe, dust is thought to form primarily in supernova (SN) ejecta, but also undergoes destruction by the reverse shock. Studying dust in local supernova remnants (SNRs) of different sizes and ages thus provides key constraints on dust formation and evolution during cosmic dawn. Using the newly released 3D $R_{\rm V}$ map, we derived local $R_{\rm V} \equiv A_{\rm V}/E(B-V)$ values for dust in 14 Galactic SNRs in the early Sedov phase and their surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). For the first time, we detect a moderately strong positive correlation between the difference in SNR and ISM $R_{\rm V}$ ($\Delta R_{\rm V}$) and SNR radius ($R_{\rm SNR}$), with a Spearman coefficient of $r_{\rm s}\,{=}\,0.62\,{\pm}\,0.14$. This trend offers direct observational evidence for a redistribution of dust grain sizes toward larger grains during SN shock processing, consistent with theoretical models. Our findings provide essential observational constraints on dust size evolution in SNRs and important implications for understanding the rapid enrichment and survival of dust in the early Universe.         |

|**Abstract**|            Periodic variability in active galactic nuclei (AGN) light curves has been proposed as a signature of close supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. Recently, 181 candidate SMBH binaries were identified in Gaia DR3 based on periodicity in their $\sim$1000-day light curves. By supplementing Gaia photometry with longer-baseline light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Catalina Real Time Transient Survey (CRTS), we test whether the reported periodic signals persist beyond the Gaia DR3 time window. We find that in all 116 cases with available ZTF data, the Gaia-inferred periodic model fails to predict subsequent variability, which appears stochastic rather than periodic. The periodic candidates thus overwhelmingly appear to be false positives; red noise contamination appears to be the primary source of false detections. We conclude that truly periodic AGN are exceedingly rare, with at most a few in $10^6$ AGN exhibiting stable periodicity on 100 to 1000 day timescales. Models predict that the Gaia AGN light curve sample should contain dozens of true SMBH binaries with periods within the observational baseline, so the lack of strictly periodic light curves in the sample suggests that most short-period binary AGN do not have light curves dominated by simple periodicity.         |
