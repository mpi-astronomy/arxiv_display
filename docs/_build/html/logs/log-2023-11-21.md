|**Abstract**| We aim to understand the physical mechanisms that drive star formation in a sample of mass-complete (>10$^{9.5}M_{\odot}$) star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at 1.2 $\leq z$ < 1.6. We selected SFGs from the COSMOS2020 catalog and applied a $uv$-domain stacking analysis to their archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) data. Our stacking analysis provides precise measurements of the mean molecular gas mass and size of SFGs. We also applied an image-domain stacking analysis on their \textit{HST} $i$-band and UltraVISTA $J$- and $K_{\rm s}$-band images. Correcting these rest-frame optical sizes using the $R_{\rm half-stellar-light}$-to-$R_{\rm half-stellar-mass}$ conversion at rest 5,000 angstrom, we obtain the stellar mass size of MS galaxies. Across the MS (-0.2 < $\Delta$MS < 0.2), the mean molecular gas fraction of SFGs increases by a factor of $\sim$1.4, while their mean molecular gas depletion time decreases by a factor of $\sim$1.8. The scatter of the MS could thus be caused by variations in both the star formation efficiency and molecular gas fraction of SFGs. The majority of the SFGs lying on the MS have $R_{\rm FIR}$ $\approx$ $R_{\rm stellar}$. Their central regions are subject to large dust attenuation. Starbursts (SBs, $\Delta$MS>0.7) have a mean molecular gas fraction $\sim$2.1 times larger and mean molecular gas depletion time $\sim$3.3 times shorter than MS galaxies. Additionally, they have more compact star-forming regions ($\sim$2.5~kpc for MS galaxies vs. $\sim$1.4~kpc for SBs) and systematically disturbed rest-frame optical morphologies, which is consistent with their association with major-mergers. SBs and MS galaxies follow the same relation between their molecular gas mass and star formation rate surface densities with a slope of $\sim1.1-1.2$, that is, the so-called KS relation. |

|**Abstract**| Methods: Observing the large pc-scale Stokes I mm dust continuum emission with the IRAM 30m telescope and the intermediate-scale (<0.1pc) polarized submm dust emission with the Submillimeter Array toward a sample of 20 high-mass star-forming regions allows us to quantify the dependence of the fragmentation behaviour of these regions depending on the density and magnetic field structures. Results: We infer density distributions n~r^{-p} of the regions with typical power-law slopes p around ~1.5. There is no obvious correlation between the power-law slopes of the density structures on larger clump scales (~1pc) and the number of fragments on smaller core scales (<0.1pc). Comparing the large-scale single-dish density profiles to those derived earlier from interferometric observations at smaller spatial scales, we find that the smaller-scale power-law slopes are steeper, typically around ~2.0. The flattening toward larger scales is consistent with the star-forming regions being embedded in larger cloud structures that do not decrease in density away from a particular core. Regarding the magnetic field, for several regions it appears aligned with filamentary structures leading toward the densest central cores. Furthermore, we find different polarization structures with some regions exhibiting central polarization holes whereas other regions show polarized emission also toward the central peak positions. Nevertheless, the polarized intensities are inversely related to the Stokes I intensities. We estimate magnetic field strengths between ~0.2 and ~4.5mG, and we find no clear correlation between magnetic field strength and the fragmentation level of the regions. Comparison of the turbulent to magnetic energies shows that they are of roughly equal importance in this sample. The mass-to-flux ratios range between ~2 and ~7, consistent with collapsing star-forming regions. |

|**Abstract**| To understand the relation between NH$_2$D and its physical environment, we mapped ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$ at 85.9 GHz toward 24 Galactic late-stage massive star-forming regions with Institut de Radioastronomie Millim$ \'e$trique (IRAM) 30-m telescope. Ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$ was detected in 18 of 24 sources. Comparing with the distribution of H$^{13}$CN 1-0 as a dense gas tracer and radio recombination line H42$\alpha$, ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$ present complex and diverse spatial distribution in these targets. 11 of the 18 targets, present a different distribution between ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$ and H$^{13}$CN 1-0, while no significant difference between these two lines can be found in the other 7 sources, mainly due to limited spatial resolution and sensitivity. Moreover, with H42$\alpha$ tracing massive young stellar objects, ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$ seems to show a relatively weak emission near the massive young stellar objects. |

|**Abstract**| The observations of gravitational wave (GW) provide us a new probe to study the universe. GW events can be used as standard sirens if their redshifts are measured. Normally, stardard sirens can be divided into bright/dark sirens according to whether the redshifts are measured by electromagnetic (EM) counterpart observations. Firstly, we investigate the capability of the 2.5-meter Wide-Field Survey Telescope (WFST) to take follow-up observations of kilonova counterparts. For binary neutron star (BNS) bright sirens, WFST is expected to observe 10-20 kilonovae per year in the second-generation (2G) GW detection era. As for neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers, when a BH spin is extremely high and the NS is stiff, the observation rate is $\sim10$ per year. Combining optical and GW observations, the bright sirens are expected to constrain the Hubble constant $H_0$ to $\sim2.8\%$ in five years of observations. As for dark sirens, tidal effects of neutron stars (NSs) during merging time provide us a cosmological model-independent approach to measure the redshifts of GW sources. Then we investigate the applications of tidal effects in redshift measurements. We find in 3G era, the host galaxy groups of around 45\% BNS mergers at $z<0.1$ can be identified through this method, if the EOS is ms1, which is roughly equivalent to the results from luminosity distant constraints. Therefore, tidal effect observations provide a reliable and cosmological model-independent method of identifying BNS mergers' host galaxy groups. Using this method, the BNS/NSBH dark sirens can constrain $H_0$ to 0.2\%/0.3\% over a five-year observation period. |

|| S. Crowe, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-11-21*|

|**Abstract**| Methods: Broad- and narrow-band imaging of AFGL 5180 was made in the NIR with the LBT, in both seeing-limited ($\sim0.5\arcsec$) and high angular resolution ($\sim0.09\arcsec$) Adaptive Optics (AO) modes, as well as with HST. Archival ALMA continuum data was also utilized. Results: At least 40 jet knots were identified via NIR emission from H$_2$ and [FeII] tracing shocked gas. Bright jet knots outflowing from the central most massive protostar, S4, are detected towards the east of the source and are resolved in fine detail with the AO imaging. Additional knots are distributed throughout the field, likely indicating the presence of multiple driving sources. Sub-millimeter sources detected by ALMA are shown to be grouped in two main complexes, AFGL 5180 M and a small cluster $\sim15\arcsec$ to the south, AFGL 5180 S. From our NIR continuum images we identify YSO candidates down to masses of $\sim 0.1\:M_\odot$. Combined with the sub-mm sources, this yields a surface number density of such YSOs of $N_* \sim 10^3 {\rm pc}^{-2}$ within a projected radius of about 0.1 pc. Such a value is similar to those predicted by models of both Core Accretion from a turbulent clump environment and Competitive Accretion. The radial profile of $N_*$ is relatively flat on scales out to 0.2~pc, with only modest enhancement around the massive protostar inside 0.05~pc. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the utility of high-resolution NIR imaging, in particular with AO, for detecting outflow activity and YSOs in distant regions. The presented images reveal the complex morphology of outflow-shocked gas within the large-scale bipolar flow of a massive protostar, as well as clear evidence for several other outflow driving sources in the region. Finally, this work presents a novel approach to compare the observed YSO surface number density from our study against different models of massive star formation. |
