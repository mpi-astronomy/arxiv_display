|**Abstract**|            The unstable accretion phases during pre-main-sequence evolution of T Tauri stars produce variable irradiation and heating of planet-forming regions. A strong accretion outburst was observed with Spitzer-IRS in 2008 in EX Lup, the prototype of EXor variables, and found to increase the mid-infrared water and OH emission and decrease organic emission, suggesting large chemical changes. We present here two JWST-MIRI epochs of quiescent EX Lup in 2022 and 2023 obtained over a decade after the 2008 outburst and several months after a moderate burst in 2022. With JWST's sharper spectral view, we can now analyze water emission as a function of temperature in the two MIRI epochs and, approximately, also in the previous Spitzer epochs. This new analysis shows a strong cold water vapor ``burst" in low-energy lines during the 2008 outburst, which we consider clear evidence for enhanced ice sublimation due to a recession of the snowline, as found in protostellar envelopes. JWST shows that EX Lup still has an unusually strong emission from cold water in comparison to other T Tauri disks, suggesting > 10-yr-long freeze-out timescales in the inner disk surface. EX Lup demonstrates that outbursts can significantly change the observed organic-to-water ratios and increase the cold water reservoir, providing chemical signatures to study the recent accretion history of disks. This study provides an unprecedented demonstration of the chemical evolution triggered by accretion outbursts in the Class II phase and of the high potential of time-domain experiments to reveal processes that may have fundamental implications on planet-forming bodies near the snowline.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report MIRI-JWST coronagraphic observations at 11.3 and 15.5 mic of the debris disk around the young star HD 106906. The observations were made to characterize the structure, temperature and mass of the disk through the thermal emission of the dust heated by the central star. Another goal was also to constrain the size distribution of the grains. The data were reduced and calibrated using the JWST pipeline. The analysis was based on a forward-modeling of the images using a multiparameter radiative transfer model coupled to an optical code for coronagraphy processing. The disk is clearly detected at both wavelengths. The slight asymmetry is geometrically consistent with the asymmetry observed in the near-IR, but it is inconsistent the brightness distribution. The observed structure is well reproduced with a model of a disk (or belt) with a critical radius 70 au, a mildly inward-increasing density (index 2) and a steeper decrease outward (index -6). This indication of a filled disk inside the critical radius is inconsistent with sculpting from an inner massive planet. The size distribution of the grains that cause the mid-IR emission is well constrained by the flux ratio at the two wavelengths : 0.45 10 mic and 0.65 10 mic for silicate and graphite grains, respectively. The minimum size is consistent with predictions of blowout through radiative pressure. We derive a mass of the dust that causes the mid-IR emission of 3.3 5.0 E3 Mearth. When the larger grains (up to 1 cm) that cause the millimeter emission are included, we extrapolate this mass to 0.10 0.16 Mearth. We point out to that this is fully consistent with ALMA observations of the disk in terms of dust mass and of its millimeter flux. We estimate the average dust temperature in the planetesimal belt to be 74 K, and a temperature range within the whole disk from 40 to 130 K.         |

|| D. Carrera, et al. -- incl., <mark>H. Baehr</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-04-21*|

|**Abstract**|            There is growing evidence that planet formation begins early, within the $\lesssim 1$Myr Class 0/I phase, when infall dominates disk dynamics. Our goal is to determine if Class 0/I disks reach the conditions needed to form planetesimals ($\sim 100$km planet building blocks) by the streaming instability (SI). We focus on a recent suggestion that early infall causes an ``inflationary'' phase in which dust grains are advected outward. We modified the \texttt{DustPy} code to build a 1D disk that includes dust evolution, infall, and heating and cooling sources. We ran six models and examined the implications for the SI, taking into account recent works on how the SI responds to external turbulence. In line with other works, we find that grains are advected outward, which leads to ``advection-condensation-drift'' loop that greatly enhances the dust density at the water snowline. However, we do not see this process at the silicate line. Instead, we find a new pile up at the edge of the expanding disk. However, despite these localized enhancements, even a modest amount of turbulence ($\alpha = 10^{-3}$) leaves planetesimal formation far out of reach. The midplane dust-to-gas ratio is at least an order of magnitude below the SI threshold, even taking into account recent results on how dust coagulation boosts the SI. For planetesimals to form in the Class 0/I phase may require a way to transport angular momentum without turbulence (e.g., disk winds) or a non-SI mechanism to form planetesimals.         |

|| W. Xin, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            Massive stars are significant sites for the weak s-process (ws-process). $^{22}$Ne and $^{16}$O are, respectively, the main neutron source and poison for the ws-process. In the metal-poor stars, the abundance of $^{22}$Ne is limited by the metallicity, so that the contribution of $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg reaction on the s-process is small. Conversely, the $^{17}$O($\alpha$, n)$^{20}$Ne reaction is more evident in more metal-poor stars due to the most abundant $^{16}$O in all metallicities. In this work, we calculate the evolution of four metal-poor models ($Z=10^{-3}$) for the Zero-Age Main-Sequence (ZAMS) masses of $M ({\rm ZAMS})=$ 15, 20, 25, and 30 M$_{\odot}$ to investigate the effect of reaction rates on the ws-process. We adopt the new $^{17}$O($\alpha$, n)$^{20}$Ne and $^{17}$O($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{21}$Ne reaction rates suggested by Wiescher et al. (2023) and $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg and $^{22}$Ne($\alpha, \gamma$)$^{26}$Mg from Best et al. (2013). The yields of the s-process isotope with updated reaction rates are compared with the results using default reaction rates from JINA REACLIB. We find that the effects of new $^{17}$O+$\alpha$ are much more significant than those of new $^{22}$Ne+$\alpha$ reaction rates in the non-rotation stars.         |
