|**Abstract**|            Several phenomenological aspects of low-luminosity neutron star transients, such as atolls, remain poorly understood. One such source, MAXI J1807+132, entered its latest outburst in July 2023. To thoroughly characterize this outburst, we conducted an extensive observational campaign spanning radio to X-ray wavelengths. Here, we present the results of this campaign, which covered the period from before the outburst to the return to quiescence. We detected a delay between the X-ray and optical rise times, which is consistent with the predictions of the disk instability model with a truncated disk. The color evolution and optical/X-ray correlations, along with infrared and radio detections, support the presence of jet synchrotron emission during the gradual decay phase following the peak. We also report for the first time in an X-ray binary a near-orthogonal rotation of the optical polarization just before a small flare, after which the jet is thought to be quenched. The main outburst is followed by several high-amplitude, rapid reflares in the optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray bands, the origin of which remains difficult to constrain.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present in this proceeding the results of the test phase of the GRAVITY+ adaptive optics. This extreme AO will enable both high-dynamic range observations of faint companions (including exoplanets) thanks to a 40x40 sub-apertures wavefront control, and sensitive observations (including AGNs) thanks to the addition of a laser guide star to each UT of the VLT. This leap forward is made thanks to a mostly automated setup of the AO, including calibration of the NCPAs, that we tested in Europe on the UT+atmosphere simulator we built in Nice. We managed to reproduce in laboratory the expected performances of all the modes of the AO, including under non-optimal atmospheric or telescope alignment conditions, giving us the green light to proceed with the Assembly, Integration and Verification phase in Paranal.         |
