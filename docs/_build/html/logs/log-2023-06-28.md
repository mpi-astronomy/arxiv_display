|**Abstract**| Maximizing the scientific return of Roman requires focusing on the scientific discovery space opened up by Roman relative to the ground: i.e., planets in wide orbits (log s > 0.4), the smallest mass-ratio planets (log q < -4.5), and free-floating planet candidates (especially those with thetaE < 1 uas). However, capitalizing on that leverage requires not just detecting such planets but characterizing them sufficiently that they can be used in a statistical analysis. In particular, the signals from all three categories are all prone to light curve degeneracies that may lead to ambiguities in the planet mass-ratio q, separation s, and the size of the source rho (used to measure thetaE and constrain the host mass). Bound planets may also have light curves that are degenerate with models that include a second source rather than a planet. The most immediate need for designing the Roman Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey is a detailed simulation of wide-orbit and small planetary perturbations to investigate how well the planet perturbations will be characterized. These investigations and related trade-studies must be done in order to maximize Roman's ability to take advantage of new parameter space. |

|**Abstract**| With its capacity to observe $\sim 10^{5-6}$ faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) out to redshift $z\approx 6$, Roman is poised to reveal a population of $10^{4-6}\, {\rm M_\odot}$ black holes during an epoch of vigorous galaxy assembly. By measuring the light curves of a subset of these AGN and looking for periodicity, Roman can identify several hundred massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with 5-12 day orbital periods, which emit copious gravitational radiation and will inevitably merge on timescales of $10^{3-5}$ years. During the last few months of their merger, such binaries are observable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a joint ESA/NASA gravitational wave mission set to launch in the mid-2030s. Roman can thus find LISA precursors, provide uniquely robust constraints on the LISA source population, help identify the host galaxies of LISA mergers, and unlock the potential of multi-messenger astrophysics with massive black hole binaries. |

|**Abstract**| Protostellar outflows and jets are almost ubiquitous characteristics during the mass accretion phase, and encode the history of stellar accretion, complex-organic molecule (COM) formation, and planet formation. Episodic jets are likely connected to episodic accretion through the disk. Despite the importance, there is a lack of studies of a statistically significant sample of protostars via high-sensitivity and high-resolution observations. To explore episodic accretion mechanisms and the chronologies of episodic events, we investigated 42 fields containing protostars with ALMA observations of CO, SiO, and 1.3\,mm continuum emission. We detected SiO emission in 21 fields, where 19 sources are driving confirmed molecular jets with high abundances of SiO. Jet velocities, mass-loss rates, mass-accretion rates, and periods of accretion events are found to be dependent on the driving forces of the jet (e.g., bolometric luminosity, envelope mass). Next, velocities and mass-loss rates are positively correlated with the surrounding envelope mass, suggesting that the presence of high mass around protostars increases the ejection-accretion activity. We determine mean periods of ejection events of 20$-$175 years for our sample, which could be associated with perturbation zones of $\sim$ 2$-$25\,au extent around the protostars. Also, mean ejection periods are anti-correlated with the envelope mass, where high-accretion rates may trigger more frequent ejection events. The observed periods of outburst/ejection are much shorter than the freeze-out time scale of the simplest COMs like CH$_3$OH, suggesting that episodic events largely maintain the ice-gas balance inside and around the snowline. |

|**Abstract**| The hierarchical structure formation paradigm predicts the formation of pairs of supermassive black holes in merging galaxies. When both (or one) members of the SMBH pair are unobscured AGNs, the system can be identified as a dual (or offset) AGN. Quantifying the abundance of these AGN pairs as functions of separation, redshift and host properties is crucial to understanding SMBH formation and AGN fueling in the broad context of galaxy formation. The High Latitude Wide Area Survey with Roman, with its unprecedented combination of sensitivity, spatial resolution, area and NIR wavelength coverage, will revolutionize the study of galactic-scale environments of SMBH pairs. This white paper summarizes the science opportunities and technical requirements on the discovery and characterization of SMBH pairs down to galactic scales (i.e., less than tens of kpc) over broad ranges of redshift (1<z<7) and luminosity (Lbol>1E42 erg/s). |
