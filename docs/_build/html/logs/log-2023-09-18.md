|**Abstract**| We study the stellar population properties of 182 spectroscopically-confirmed (MUSE/VLT) Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) and 450 photometrically-selected Lyman-Break galaxies (LBGs) at z = 2.8 - 6.7 in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF). Leveraging the combined power of HST and JWST NIRCam and MIRI observations, we analyse their rest-frame UV-through-near-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with MIRI playing a crucial role in robustly assessing the LAE's stellar mass and ages. Our LAEs are low-mass objects (log$_{10}$(M$_\star$[M$_\odot$]) ~ 7.5), with little or no dust extinction (E(B - V) ~ 0.1) and a blue UV continuum slope ($\beta$ ~ -2.2). While 75% of our LAEs are young (< 100 Myr), the remaining 25% have significantly older stellar populations (> 100 Myr). These old LAEs are statistically more massive, less extinct and have lower specific star formation rate (sSFR) compared to young LAEs. Besides, they populate the M$_\star$ - SFR plane along the main-sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies, while young LAEs populate the starburst region. The comparison between the LAEs properties to those of a stellar-mass matched sample of LBGs shows no statistical difference between these objects, except for the LBGs redder UV continuum slope and marginally larger E(B - V) values. Interestingly, 48% of the LBGs have ages < 10 Myr and are classified as starbursts, but lack detectable Ly$\alpha$ emission. This is likely due to HI resonant scattering and/or selective dust extinction. Overall, we find that JWST observations are crucial in determining the properties of LAEs and shedding light on the properties and similarities between LAEs and LBGs. |

|**Abstract**| Optical quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are the most preferred signs of sub-pc binary black hole (BBH) systems in AGN. In this manuscript, robust optical QPOs are reported in quasar SDSS J1609+1756 at $z=0.347$. In order to detect reliable optical QPOs, four different methods are applied to analyze the 4.45 years-long ZTF g/r/i-band light curves of SDSS J1609+1756, direct fitting results by sine function, Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram, Auto-Cross Correlation Function and Weighted Wavelet Z-transform method. The Four different methods can lead to well determined reliable optical QPOs with periodicities $\sim340$ days with confidence levels higher than 5$\sigma$, to guarantee the robustness of the optical QPOs in SDSS J1609+1756. Meanwhile, based on simulated light curves through CAR process to trace intrinsic AGN activities, confidence level higher than $3\sigma$ can be confirmed that the optical QPOs are not mis-detected in intrinsic AGN activities, re-confirming the robust optical QPOs and strongly indicating a central sub-pc BBH system in SDSS J1609+1756. Furthermore, based on apparent red-shifted shoulders in broad Balmer emission lines in SDSS J1609+1756, space separation of the expected central BBH system can be estimated to be smaller than $107\pm60$ light-days, accepted upper limit of total BH mass $\sim(1.03\pm0.22)\times10^8{\rm M_\odot}$. Therefore, to detect and report BBH system expected optical QPOs with periodicities around 1 year is efficiently practicable through ZTF light curves, and combining with peculiar broad line emission features, further clues should be given on space separations of BBH systems in broad line AGN in the near future. |

|**Abstract**| As the millimeter wavelength range remains a largely unexplored spectral region for galaxies, the IMEGIN large program aims to map the millimeter continuum emission of 22 nearby galaxies at 1.15 and 2 mm. Using the high-resolution maps produced by the NIKA2 camera, we explore the existence of very cold dust and take possible contamination by free-free and synchrotron emission into account. We study the IR-to-radio emission coming from different regions along the galactic plane and at large vertical distances. New observations of NGC 891, using the NIKA2 camera on the IRAM 30m telescope, along with a suite of observations at other wavelengths were used to perform a multiwavelength study of the spectral energy distribution in the interstellar medium in this galaxy. This analysis was performed globally and locally, using the advanced hierarchical Bayesian fitting code, HerBIE, coupled with the THEMIS dust model. Our dust modeling is able to reproduce the near-IR to millimeter emission of NGC 891, with the exception of an excess at a level of 25% obtained by the NIKA2 observations in the outermost parts of the disk. The radio continuum and thermal dust emission are distributed differently in the disk and galaxy halo. Different dusty environments are also revealed by a multiwavelength investigation of the emission features. Our detailed decomposition at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths shows that emission at 1 mm is purely originated by dust. Radio components become progressively important with increasing wavelengths. Finally, we find that emission arising from small dust grains accounts for ~ 9.5% of the total dust mass, reaching up to 20% at large galactic latitudes. Shock waves in the outflows that shatter the dust grains might explain this higher fraction of small grains in the halo. |
