|**Abstract**|            From $>1000$ orbits of HST imaging, we present deep homogeneous resolved star color-magnitude diagrams that reach the oldest main sequence turnoff and uniformly measured star formation histories (SFHs) of 36 dwarf galaxies ($-6 \ge M_V \ge -17$) associated with the M31 halo, and for 10 additional fields in M31, M33, and the Giant Stellar Stream. From our SFHs we find: i) the median stellar age and quenching epoch of M31 satellites correlate with galaxy luminosity and galactocentric distance. Satellite luminosity and present-day distance from M31 predict the satellite quenching epoch to within $1.8$ Gyr at all epochs. This tight relationship highlights the fundamental connection between satellite halo mass, environmental history, and star formation duration. ii) There is no difference between the median SFH of galaxies on and off the great plane of Andromeda satellites. iii) $\sim50$\% of our M31 satellites show prominent ancient star formation ($>12$ Gyr ago) followed by delayed quenching ($8-10$ Gyr ago), which is not commonly observed among the MW satellites. iv) A comparison with TNG50 and FIRE-2 simulated satellite dwarfs around M31-like hosts show that some of these trends (dependence of SFH on satellite luminosity) are reproduced in the simulations while others (dependence of SFH on galactocentric distance, presence of the delayed-quenching population) are weaker or absent. We provide all photometric catalogs and SFHs as High-Level Science Products on MAST.         |

|| A. Widmark, K. V. Johnston |

|**Abstract**|            We develop a novel approach to performing precision inference on tidally perturbed dwarf galaxies. We use a Bayesian inference framework of implicit likelihood inference, previously applied mainly in the field of cosmology, based on forward simulation, data compression, and likelihood emulation with neural density estimators. We consider the case of NGC205, a satellite of M31. NGC205 exhibits an S-shape in the mean line-of-sight velocity along its semi-major spatial axis, suggestive of tidal perturbation. We demonstrate that this velocity profile can be qualitatively reproduced even if NGC205 was in a spherically symmetric and isotropic state before its most recent pericenter passage. We apply our inference method to mock data and show that the precise shape of a perturbed satellite's sky-projected internal velocity field can be highly informative of both its orbit and total mass density profile, even in the absence of proper motion information. For the actual NGC205, our method is hampered because the available data only covers a line along its semi-major axis, rather than the full sky-projected field. This shortcoming could be addressed with another round of observations.         |

|**Abstract**|            Multi-wavelength dust continuum observations of protoplanetary disks are essential for accurately measuring two key ingredients of planets formation theories: the dust mass and grain size. Unfortunately, they are also extremely time-expensive. We aim to investigate the most economic way of performing this analysis. We benchmark the dust characterization analysis on multi-wavelength observations of two disk models. We test three different combinations of bands (in the 0.45 mm $\to$ 7.46 mm range) to see how optically thick and thin observations aid the reconstruction of the dust properties for different morphologies and in three different dust mass regimes. We also test different spatial resolutions. Dust properties are robustly measured in a multi-band analysis if optically thin observations are included. For typical disks, this requires wavelengths longer than 3 mm. High-resolution (< 0.03"-0.05") is fundamental to resolve the changes in dust content of substructures. However, lower-resolution results still provide an accurate measurement of the total dust mass and of the level of grain growth of rings. Additionally, we propose a new approach that successfully combines lower and higher resolution observations in the multi-wavelength analysis without losing spatial information. We also test individually enhancing the resolution of each radial intensity profile with Frank but we note the presence of artifacts. Finally, we discuss on the total dust mass that we derive from the SED analyses and compare it with the traditional method of deriving dust masses from millimeter fluxes. Accurate dust mass measurements from the SED analysis can be derived by including optically thin tracers. On the other hand, single-wavelength flux-based masses are always underestimated by even more than one order of magnitude.         |
