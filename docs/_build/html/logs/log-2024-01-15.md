|**Abstract**| The dominant mechanism forming multiple stellar systems in the high-mass regime (M$_\ast \gtrsim $ 8 $M_{\odot}$) remained unknown because direct imaging of multiple protostellar systems at early phases of high-mass star formation is very challenging. High-mass stars are expected to form in clustered environments containing binaries and higher-order multiplicity systems. So far only a few high-mass protobinary systems, and no definitive higher-order multiples, have been detected. Here we report the discovery of one quintuple, one quadruple, one triple and four binary protostellar systems simultaneously forming in a single high-mass protocluster, G333.23--0.06, using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array high-resolution observations. We present a new example of a group of gravitationally bound binary and higher-order multiples during their early formation phases in a protocluster. This provides the clearest direct measurement of the initial configuration of primordial high-order multiple systems, with implications for the in situ multiplicity and its origin. We find that the binary and higher-order multiple systems, and their parent cores, show no obvious sign of disk-like kinematic structure. We conclude that the observed fragmentation into binary and higher-order multiple systems can be explained by core fragmentation, indicating its crucial role in establishing the multiplicity during high-mass star cluster formation. |

|**Abstract**| We present the latest version of the GAEA model of galaxy formation. Our new model combines (i) an updated treatment of AGN feedback including an improved modelling of cold gas accretion on super-massive BHs and an explicit implementation of quasar winds; and (ii) an improved modelling of cold and hot gas stripping from satellite galaxies. We show that our latest model predicts specific SFR distributions that are in remarkable agreement with observational measurements in the local Universe. Our updated model predicts quenched fractions that are in very nice agreement with data up to z~3-4, and a turn-over of the number densities of quenched galaxies at low stellar masses that is in qualitative agreement with current observational estimates. We show that the main reasons for the improved behaviour with respect to previous renditions of our model are the updated treatment for satellites at low galaxy masses (<10^10 Msun) and the inclusion of quasar winds at intermediate to large stellar masses (>10^10 Msun). However, we show that the better treatment of the star formation threshold, due to our explicit partitioning of the cold gas in its atomic and molecular components, also plays an important role in suppressing excessive residual star formation in massive galaxies. While our analysis is based on a selection of quiescent galaxies that takes advantage of the information about their SFR, we demonstrate that the impact of a different (colour-colour) selection is not significant, at least for galaxies above the completeness limits of current surveys. Our new model predicts number densities of massive quiescent galaxies at z>3 that are the largest among recently published models. Yet, our model predictions appear still to be below post-JWST observational measurements. We show that the expected cosmic variance is large, and can easily accommodate some of the most recent measurements. |
