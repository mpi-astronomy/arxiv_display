|**Abstract**| We offer a new way to look at the Large Magellanic Cloud through stellar mono-abundance and mono-age-mono-abundance maps. These maps are based on $\gtrsim 500\,000$ member stars with photo-spectroscopic [M/H] and age estimates from Gaia DR3 data, and they are the first area-complete, metallicity- and age-differentiated stellar maps of any disk galaxy. Azimuthally averaged, these maps reveal a surprisingly simple picture of the Milky Way's largest satellite galaxy. For any [M/H] below -0.1 dex, the LMC's radial profile is well described by a simple exponential, but with a scale length that steadily shrinks towards higher metallicities, from nearly 2.3~kpc at [M/H]$=-1.8$ to only 0.75~kpc at [M/H]$=-0.25$. The prominence of the bar decreases dramatically with [M/H], making it barely discernible at [M/H]$\lesssim -1.5$. Yet, even for metal-rich populations, the bar has little impact on the azimuthally averaged profile of the mono-abundance components. Including ages, we find that the scale length is a greater function of age than of metallicity, with younger populations far more centrally concentrated. At old ages, the scale length decreases with increasing metallicity; at young ages, the scale-length is independent of metallicity. These findings provide quantitative support for a scenario where the LMC built its stellar structure effectively outside in. |

|**Abstract**| Context. Gaia18cjb is one of the Gaia-alerted eruptive young star candidates which has been experiencing a slow and strong brightening during the last 13 years, similar to some FU Orionis-type objects. Aims. The aim of this work is to derive the young stellar nature of Gaia18cjb, determine its physical and accretion properties to classify its variability. Methods. We conducted monitoring observations using multi-filter optical and near-infrared photometry, as well as near-infrared spectroscopy. We present the analysis of pre-outburst and outburst optical and infrared light curves, color-magnitude diagrams in different bands, the detection of near-IR spectral lines, and estimates of both stellar and accretion parameters during the burst. Results. The optical light curve shows an unusually long (8 years) brightening event of 5 mag in the last 13 years, before reaching a plateau indicating that the burst is still on-going, suggesting a FUor-like nature. The same outburst is less strong in the infrared light curves. The near-infrared spectra, obtained during the outburst, exhibit emission lines typical of highly accreting low-intermediate mass young stars with typical EXor features. The spectral index of Gaia18cjb SED classifies it as a Class I in the pre-burst stage and a Flat Spectrum young stellar object (YSO) during the burst. Conclusions. Gaia18cjb is an eruptive YSO which shows FUor-like photometric features (in terms of brightening amplitude and length of the burst) and EXor-like spectroscopic features and accretion rate, as V350 Cep and V1647 Ori, classified as objects in between FUors and EXors |

|**Abstract**| Water fountain objects are generally defined as "evolved stars with low to intermediate initial mass accompanied by high-velocity molecular jets detectable in the 22.235 GHz H$_2$O maser line". They are the key objects of understanding the morphological transitions of circumstellar envelopes during the post asymptotic giant branch phase. Masers are useful tools to trace the kinematic environments of the circumstellar envelopes. In this letter we report the discovery of exceptionally uncommon excited-state hydroxyl (ex-OH) masers at 4660 and 6031 MHz toward the water fountain source IRAS 18460-0151. These are the brightest ex-OH masers discovered in late-type objects to date. To the best of our knowledge, prior to the current work, no evolved stellar object has been observed in the 4660 MHz ex-OH maser line. The ground-state hydroxyl (g-OH) masers at 1612 and 1665 MHz are also observed. The velocity components of the 4660 MHz ex-OH maser line and the much weaker 1665 MHz g-OH maser line all can be seen in the 1612 MHz g-OH maser line profile. The blue-shifted components of the three masers are more intense than the red-shifted ones, in contrast to the ex-OH maser line at 6031 MHz. The relevance of the behaviors of the ex-OH masers to the circumstellar environments is unclear. |
