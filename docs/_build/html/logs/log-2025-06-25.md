|**Abstract**|            The Euclid mission and other next-generation large-scale structure surveys will enable high-precision measurements of the cosmic matter distribution. Understanding the impact of baryonic processes such as star formation and AGN feedback on matter clustering is crucial to ensure precise and unbiased cosmological inference. Most theoretical models of baryonic effects to date focus on two-point statistics, neglecting higher-order contributions. This work develops a fast and accurate emulator for baryonic effects on the matter bispectrum, a key non-Gaussian statistic in the nonlinear regime. We employ high-resolution $N$-body simulations from the BACCO suite and apply a combination of cutting-edge techniques such as cosmology scaling and baryonification to efficiently span a large cosmological and astrophysical parameter space. A deep neural network is trained to emulate baryonic effects on the matter bispectrum measured in simulations, capturing modifications across various scales and redshifts relevant to Euclid. We validate the emulator accuracy and robustness using an analysis of \Euclid mock data, employing predictions from the state-of-the-art FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations. The emulator reproduces baryonic suppression in the bispectrum to better than 2$\%$ for the $68\%$ percentile across most triangle configurations for $k \in [0.01, 20]\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ and ensures consistency between cosmological posteriors inferred from second- and third-order weak lensing statistics.         |

|**Abstract**|            Galaxy clusters detected through their X-ray emission or Sunyaev--Zeldovich effect (SZE), both produced by the intra-cluster medium (ICM), are key probes in cosmological and astrophysical studies. To maximise the scientific return of such surveys, complementary data are required for cluster confirmation and redshift estimation. This is typically provided by wide-field optical and infrared surveys, which are increasingly challenged by ongoing and future ICM-selected samples. In particular, at high redshifts ($z>1$) probed by upcoming SZE-selected samples, current large surveys may be insufficient for reliable confirmation. Deep, high-resolution infrared surveys like Euclid will thus be essential for confirming most high-redshift clusters. We present an analysis of the first sizeable Euclid dataset (Q1), overlapping with several ICM-selected cluster samples. We apply an adaptation of the MCMF cluster confirmation tool to estimate key properties, including redshift and richness, and to predict Euclid's capabilities for high-redshift cluster confirmation. We find promising performance, particularly at high redshifts, while richness estimates at low redshifts ($z<0.4$) are currently limited by Q1 data quality but should improve with future releases. Using MCMF runs on random lines of sight, we predict that Euclid will confirm clusters at $1<z<2$ as effectively as current optical surveys at $z<0.6$, significantly enhancing high-redshift confirmation. SZE-selected samples will thus greatly benefit from Euclid overlap. Among five known high-$z$ SZE clusters in Q1, we identify the highest-redshift jellyfish galaxy candidate to date, EUCLJ035330.86$-$504347.6 in SPT-CLJ0353$-$5043 ($z=1.32$), two massive star-forming galaxies near ACT-CLJ0350.0$-$4819 ($z=1.46$), and strong lensing features in SPT-CLJ0353$-$5043 and SPT-CLJ0421$-$4845.         |

|| B. Zhang, et al. -- incl., <mark>Y. Wang</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            Using relative stellar astrometry for the detection of coherent gravitational wave sources is a promising method for the microhertz range, where no dedicated detectors currently exist. Compared to other gravitational wave detection techniques, astrometry operates in an extreme high-baseline-number and low-SNR-per-baseline limit, which leads to computational difficulties when using conventional Bayesian search techniques. We extend a technique for efficiently searching pulsar timing array datasets through the precomputation of inner products in the Bayesian likelihood, showing that it is applicable to astrometric datasets. Using this technique, we are able to reduce the total dataset size by up to a factor of $\mathcal{O}(100)$, while remaining accurate to within 1% over two orders of magnitude in gravitational wave frequency. Applying this technique to simulated astrometric datasets for the Kepler Space Telescope and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope missions, we obtain forecasts for the sensitivity of these missions to coherent gravitational waves. Due to the low angular sky coverage of astrometric baselines, we find that coherent gravitational wave sources are poorly localized on the sky. Despite this, from $10^{-8}$ Hz to $10^{-6}$ Hz, we find that Roman is sensitive to coherent gravitational waves with an instantaneous strain above $h_0 \simeq 10^{-11.4}$, and Kepler is sensitive to strains above $h_0 \simeq $ $10^{-12.4}$. At this strain, we can detect a source with a frequency of $10^{-7}$ Hz and a chirp mass of $10^9$ $M_\odot$ at a luminosity distance of 3.6 Mpc for Kepler, and 0.3 Mpc for Roman.         |

|| S. Bhattacharyya, et al. -- incl., <mark>A. Frank</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-06-25*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            Common envelope (CE) evolution is largely governed by the drag torque applied on the inspiralling stellar components by the envelope. Previous work has shown that idealized models of the torque based on a single body moving in rectilinear motion through an unperturbed atmosphere can be highly inaccurate. Progress requires new models for the torque that account for binarity. Toward this end we perform a new 3D global hydrodynamic CE simulation with the mass of the companion point particle set equal to the mass of the asymptotic giant branch star core particle to maximize symmetry and facilitate interpretation. First, we find that a region around the particles of a scale comparable to their separation contributes essentially all of the torque. Second, the density pattern of the torque-dominating gas and, to an extent, this gas itself, is roughly in corotation with the binary. Third, approximating the spatial distribution of the torquing gas as a uniform-density prolate spheroid whose major axis resides in the orbital plane and lags the line joining the binary components by a constant phase angle reproduces the torque evolution remarkably well, analogous to studies of binary supermassive black holes. Fourth, we compare the torque measured in the simulation with the predictions of a model that assumes two weak point-mass perturbers undergoing circular motion in a uniform background without gas self-gravity, and find remarkable agreement with our results if the background density is taken to be equal to a fixed fraction ($\approx0.44$) of the density at the spheroid surface. Overall, this work makes progress toward developing simple time-dependent models of the CE phase.         |

|| I. Codron, et al. -- incl., <mark>S. Kraus</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            The outer regions of the protoplanetary disc surrounding the T Tauri star HD 143006 show rings, dust asymmetries and shadows. Whilst rings and dust asymmetries can arise from companions and other mechanisms, shadows and misaligned discs in particular are typically attributed to the presence of misaligned planets or stellar-mass companions. To understand the mechanisms that drive these traits, the innermost regions of discs need to be studied. Using CHARA/MIRCX and VLTI/PIONIER, we observed the sub-au region of HD 143006. We constrain the orientation of the inner disc of HD 143006 and probe whether a misalignment between the inner and outer disc could be the cause of the shadows. Modelling the visibilities using a geometric model, the inclination and position angle are found to be $i=22^\circ\pm 3^\circ$ and $\mathrm{PA}=158^\circ\pm 8^\circ$ respectively, with an inner dust sublimation radius of $\sim0.04$ au. The inner disc is misaligned by $39^\circ\pm4^\circ$ with respect to the outer disc, with the far side of the inner disc to the east and the far side of the outer disc to the west. We constrain $h/R$ (scattering surface/radius of scattered light) of the outer disc at $18$ au to be about $13\%$ by calculating the offset between the shadow position and the central star. No companion was detected, with a magnitude contrast of $4.4$ in the H-band and placing an upper mass limit of $0.17 M_\odot$ at separations of $0-8$ au. Therefore, we cannot confirm or rule out that a low-mass star or giant planet is responsible for the misalignment and dust sub-structures.         |
