|**Abstract**|            The early-type star ASASSN-21js started to fade in 2021, as was detected by the All Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, undergoing a multi-year eclipse that is still underway. We interpret this event as being due to a structured disc of material transiting in front of the star. The disc is in orbit around a substellar object with the mass and luminosity of a brown dwarf or smaller. We want to determine the expected duration and ending date of the eclipse. We modelled a tilted and inclined azimuthally symmetric ring system around an unseen companion and calculated the resulting time-varying light curve as the object transited in front of the star. We made an initial estimate of the ring parameters and used these as inputs to an MCMC algorithm to determine the geometric properties of the rings with associated uncertainties. The model most consistent with the light curve to date is a two-ring system at high inclination with respect to the line of sight that has a semi-major axis of 71.6 stellar radii. With an estimate of the stellar radius, the transverse velocity is around 0.7 km/s, which if bound to the star is an orbit with a semi-major axis of around 13000 au, placing it in the Oort cloud of the parent star. The transit is ongoing and will finish around MJD 61526 (May 1 2027). We encourage the community to continue observing this object in order to understand its properties.         |

|**Abstract**|            Electromagnetic follow-up observations of gravitational wave events offer critical insights and provide significant scientific gain from this new class of astrophysical transients. Accurate identification of gravitational wave candidates and rapid release of sky localization information are crucial for the success of these electromagnetic follow-up observations. However, searches for gravitational wave candidates in real time suffer a non-negligible false alarm rate. By leveraging the sky localization information and other metadata associated with gravitational wave candidates, GWSkyNet, a machine learning classifier developed by Cabero et al. (2020), demonstrated promising accuracy for the identification of the origin of event candidates. We improve the performance of the classifier for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's fourth observing run by reviewing and updating the architecture and features used as inputs by the algorithm. We also retrain and fine-tune the classifier with data from the third observing run. To improve the prospect of electromagnetic follow-up observations, we incorporate GWSkyNet into LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's low-latency infrastructure as an automatic pipeline for the evaluation of gravitational wave alerts in real time. We test the readiness of the algorithm on a LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA mock data challenge campaign. The results show that by thresholding on the GWSkyNet score, noise masquerading as astrophysical sources can be rejected efficiently and the majority of true astrophysical signals correctly identified.         |
