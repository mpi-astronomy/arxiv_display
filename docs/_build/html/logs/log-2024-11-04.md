|**Abstract**|            Using early data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, we search for AGN signatures in 410,757 line-emitting galaxies. By employing the BPT emission-line ratio diagnostic diagram, we identify AGN in 75,928/296,261 ($\approx$25.6%) high-mass ($\log (M_{\star}/\rm M_{\odot}) >$ 9.5) and 2,444/114,496 ($\approx$2.1%) dwarf ($\log (M_{\star}/\rm M_{\odot}) \leq$ 9.5) galaxies. Of these AGN candidates, 4,181 sources exhibit a broad H$\alpha$ component, allowing us to estimate their BH masses via virial techniques. This study more than triples the census of dwarf AGN as well as that of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH; $M_{\rm BH} \le 10^6~\rm M_{\odot}$) candidates, spanning a broad discovery space in stellar mass (7 $< \log (M_{\star}/\rm M_{\odot}) <$ 12) and redshift (0.001 $< \rm z <$ 0.45). The observed AGN fraction in dwarf galaxies ($\approx$2.1%) is nearly four times higher than prior estimates, primarily due to DESI's smaller fiber size, which enables the detection of lower luminosity dwarf AGN candidates. We also extend the $M_{\rm BH}$ - $M_{\star}$ scaling relation down to $\log (M_{\star}/\rm M_{\odot}) \approx$ 8.5 and $\log (M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot}) \approx$ 4.4, with our results aligning well with previous low-redshift studies. The large statistical sample of dwarf AGN candidates from current and future DESI releases will be invaluable for enhancing our understanding of galaxy evolution at the low-mass end of the galaxy mass function.         |

|**Abstract**|            The large-scale imaging survey will produce massive photometric data in multi-bands for billions of galaxies. Defining strategies to quickly and efficiently extract useful physical information from this data is mandatory. Among the stellar population parameters for galaxies, their stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) are the most fundamental. We develop a novel tool, \textit{Multi-Layer Perceptron for Predicting Galaxy Parameters} (MLP-GaP), that uses a machine-learning (ML) algorithm to accurately and efficiently derive the stellar masses and SFRs from multi-band catalogs. We first adopt a mock dataset generated by the \textit{Code Investigating GALaxy Emission} (CIGALE) for training and testing datasets. Subsequently, we used a multi-layer perceptron model to build MLP-GaP and effectively trained it with the training dataset. The results of the test performed on the mock dataset show that MLP-GaP can accurately predict the reference values. Besides MLP-GaP has a significantly faster processing speed than CIGALE. To demonstrate the science-readiness of the MLP-GaP, we also apply it to a real data sample and compare the stellar masses and SFRs with CIGALE. Overall, the predicted values of MLP-GaP show a very good consistency with the estimated values derived from SED fitting. Therefore, the capability of MLP-GaP to rapidly and accurately predict stellar masses and SFRs makes it particularly well-suited for analyzing huge amounts of galaxies in the era of large sky surveys.         |

|| <mark>J. Li</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-04*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters (15 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables)*|
|**Abstract**|            The extinction curve of interstellar dust in the dense molecular cloud cores is crucial for understanding dust properties, particularly size distribution and composition. We investigate the infrared extinction law in four nearby isolated molecular cloud cores, L429, L483, L673, and L1165, across the 1.2 - 8.0 $\mu$m wavelength range, using deep near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) photometric data from UKIDSS and Spitzer Space Telescope. These observations probe an unprecedented extinction depth, reaching $A_V\sim$ 40-60 mag in these dense cloud cores. We derive color-excess ratios $E(K-\lambda)/E(H-K)$ by fitting color-color diagrams of $(K-\lambda)$ versus $(H-K)$, which are subsequently used to calculate the extinction law $A_\lambda/A_K$. Our analysis reveals remarkably similar and exceptionally flat infrared extinction curves for all four cloud cores, exhibiting the most pronounced flattening reported in the literature to date. This flatness is consistent with the presence of large dust grains, suggesting significant grain growth in dense environments. Intriguingly, our findings align closely with the Astrodust model for a diffuse interstellar environment proposed by Hensley \& Draine. This agreement between dense core observations and a diffuse medium model highlights the complexity of dust evolution and the need for further investigation into the processes governing dust properties in different interstellar environments.         |

|**Abstract**|            In June 2022, the Gaia mission released a catalog of astrometric orbital solutions for 168,065 binary systems, by far the largest such catalog to date. Unlike previous binary stars catalogs, which were heterogeneous collections of orbits from different surveys and instruments, these orbits were derived using Gaia data alone. Despite this homogeneity, the selection function is difficult to characterize because of choices made in the construction of the catalog. Understanding the catalog's selection function is required to model and interpret its contents. We use a combination of analytic and empirical prescriptions to construct a function that computes the probability that a binary with a given set of properties would have been published in the Gaia Data Release 3 astrometric orbit catalog. We also construct a binary population synthesis model based on Moe & Di Stefano (2017) to validate our characterization of the selection function, finding good agreement with the actual Gaia NSS catalog, with the exception of the orbital eccentricity distribution. The NSS catalog suggests high-eccentricity orbits are relatively uncommon at intermediate periods $100 \lesssim P_{orb} \lesssim 1000$ days. As an example application of the selection function, we estimate the Gaia DR3 detection probabilities of the star + BH binaries Gaia BH1, BH2, and BH3. We also estimate the population of Sun-like star + BH binaries in the Galaxy to be $\sim 5000$ for $100 < P_{orb} < 400$ day, $\lesssim 2,000$ for $400 < P_{orb} < 1000$ day, and $ \lesssim 20,000$ for $1000 < P_{orb} < 2000$ days.         |

|**Abstract**|            ALMA surveys have suggested that protoplanetary disks are not massive enough to form the known exoplanet population, under the assumption that the millimeter continuum emission is optically thin. In this work, we investigate how the mass determination is influenced when the porosity of dust grains is considered in radiative transfer models. The results show that disks with porous dust opacities yield similar dust temperature, but systematically lower millimeter fluxes compared to disks incorporating compact dust grains. Moreover, we recalibrate the relation between dust temperature and stellar luminosity for a wide range of stellar parameters, and calculate the dust masses of a large sample of disks using the traditionally analytic approach. The median dust mass from our calculation is about 6 times higher than the literature result, and this is mostly driven by the different opacities of porous and compact grains. A comparison of the cumulative distribution function between disk dust masses and exoplanet masses show that the median exoplanet mass is about 2 times lower than the median dust mass, if grains are porous, and there are no exoplanetary systems with masses higher than the most massive disks. Our analysis suggests that adopting porous dust opacities may alleviate the mass budget problem for planet formation. As an example illustrating the combined effects of optical depth and porous dust opacities on the mass estimation, we conduct new IRAM/NIKA-2 observations toward the IRAS 04370+2559 disk and perform a detailed radiative transfer modeling of the spectral energy distribution. The best-fit dust mass is roughly 100 times higher than the value from the traditionally analytic calculation. Future spatially resolved observations at various wavelengths are required to better constrain the dust mass.         |

|**Abstract**|            Astrometry from Gaia DR3 has produced a sample of $\sim$170,000 Keplerian orbital solutions, with many more anticipated in the next few years. These data have enormous potential to constrain the population of binary stars, giant planets, and compact objects in the Solar neighborhood. But in order to use the published orbit catalogs for statistical inference, it is necessary to understand their selection function: what is the probability that a binary with a given set of properties ends up in a catalog? We show that such a selection function for the Gaia DR3 astrometric binary catalog can be forward-modeled from the Gaia scanning law, including individual 1D astrometric measurements, the fitting of a cascade of astrometric models, and quality cuts applied in post-processing. We populate a synthetic Milky Way model with binary stars and generate a mock catalog of astrometric orbits. The mock catalog is quite similar to the DR3 astrometric binary sample, suggesting that our selection function is a sensible approximation of reality. Our fitting also produces a sample of spurious astrometric orbits similar to those found in DR3; these are mainly the result of scan angle-dependent astrometric biases in marginally resolved wide binaries. We show that Gaia's sensitivity to astrometric binaries falls off rapidly at high eccentricities, but only weakly at high inclinations. We predict that DR4 will yield $\sim 1$ million astrometric orbits, mostly for bright ($G \lesssim 15$) systems with long periods ($P_{\rm orb} \gtrsim 1000$ d). We provide code to simulate and fit realistic Gaia epoch astrometry for any data release and determine whether any hypothetical binary would receive a cataloged orbital solution.         |
