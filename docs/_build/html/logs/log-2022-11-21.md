|**Abstract**| Benchmark brown dwarf companions with well-determined ages and model-independent masses are powerful tools to test substellar evolutionary models and probe the formation of giant planets and brown dwarfs. Here, we report the independent discovery of HIP~21152~B, the first imaged brown dwarf companion in the Hyades, and conduct a comprehensive orbital and atmospheric characterization of the system. HIP~21152 was targeted in an ongoing high-contrast imaging campaign of stars exhibiting proper motion changes between Hipparcos and Gaia, and was also recently identified by Bonavita et al. (2022) and Kuzuhara et al. (2022). Our Keck/NIRC2 and SCExAO/CHARIS imaging of HIP~21152 revealed a comoving companion at a separation of $0.37^{\prime\prime}$ (16 au). We perform a joint orbit fit of all available relative astrometry and radial velocities together with the Hipparcos-Gaia proper motions, yielding a dynamical mass of $24^{+6}_{-4}\,\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$, which is $1{-}2{\sigma}$ lower than evolutionary model predictions. Hybrid grids that include the evolution of cloud properties best reproduce the dynamical mass. We also identify a comoving wide-separation ($1837^{\prime\prime}$ or $7.9 \times 10^4 \, \mathrm{au}$) early-L dwarf with an inferred mass near the hydrogen-burning limit. Finally, we analyze the spectra and photometry of HIP~21152~B using the Saumon & Marley (2008) atmospheric models and a suite of retrievals. The best-fit grid-based models have $f_{\mathrm{sed}}=2$, indicating the presence of clouds, $T_{\mathrm{eff}}=1400 \, \mathrm{K}$, and $\log{g}=4.5 \, \mathrm{dex}$. These results are consistent with the object's spectral type of $\mathrm{T0\pm1}$. As the first benchmark brown dwarf companion in the Hyades, HIP~21152~B joins the small but growing number of substellar companions with well-determined ages and dynamical masses. |

|**Abstract**| The mass distribution of dense cores is a potential key to understand the process of star formation. Applying dendrogram analysis to the CARMA-NRO Orion C$^{18}$O ($J$=1--0) data, we identify 2342 dense cores, about 22 \% of which have virial ratios smaller than 2, and can be classified as gravitationally bound cores. The derived core mass function (CMF) for bound starless cores which are not associate with protostars has a slope similar to Salpeter's initial mass function (IMF) for the mass range above 1 $M_\odot$, with a peak at $\sim$ 0.1 $M_\odot$. We divide the cloud into four parts based on the declination, OMC-1/2/3, OMC-4/5, L1641N/V380 Ori, and L1641C, and derive the CMFs in these regions. We find that starless cores with masses greater than 10 $M_\odot$ exist only in OMC-1/2/3, whereas the CMFs in OMC-4/5, L1641N, and L1641C are truncated at around 5--10 $M_\odot$. From the number ratio of bound starless cores and Class II objects in each subregion, the lifetime of bound starless cores is estimated to be 5--30 free-fall times, consistent with previous studies for other regions. In addition, we discuss core growth by mass accretion from the surrounding cloud material to explain the coincidence of peak masses between IMFs and CMFs. The mass accretion rate required for doubling the core mass within a core lifetime is larger than that of Bondi-Hoyle accretion by a factor of order 2. This implies that more dynamical accretion processes are required to grow cores. |

|**Abstract**| On the Sun, Doppler shifts of bidirectional outflows from the magnetic-reconnection site have been found only in confined regions through spectroscopic observations. Without spatially resolved spectroscopic observations across an extended region, the distribution of reconnection and its outflows in the solar atmosphere cannot be made clear. Magnetic reconnection is thought to cause the splitting of filament structures, but unambiguous evidence has been elusive. Here we report spectroscopic and imaging analysis of a magnetic-reconnection event on the Sun, using high-resolution data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Our findings reveal that the reconnection region extends to an unprecedented length of no less than 14,000 km. The reconnection splits a filament structure into two branches, and the upper branch erupts eventually. Doppler shifts indicate clear bidirectional outflows of ~100 km/s, which decelerate beyond the reconnection site. Differential-emission-measure analysis reveals that in the reconnection region the temperature reaches over 10 MK and the thermal energy is much larger than the kinetic energy. This Letter provides definite spectroscopic evidence for the splitting of a solar filament by magnetic reconnection in an extended region. |

|**Abstract**| Rapid advances in deep learning have brought not only myriad powerful neural networks, but also breakthroughs that benefit established scientific research. In particular, automatic differentiation (AD) tools and computational accelerators like GPUs have facilitated forward modeling of the Universe with differentiable simulations. Current differentiable cosmological simulations are limited by memory, thus are subject to a trade-off between time and space/mass resolution. They typically integrate for only tens of time steps, unlike the standard non-differentiable simulations. We present a new approach free of such constraints, using the adjoint method and reverse time integration. It enables larger and more accurate forward modeling, and will improve gradient based optimization and inference. We implement it in a particle-mesh (PM) $N$-body library pmwd (particle-mesh with derivatives). Based on the powerful AD system JAX, pmwd is fully differentiable, and is highly performant on GPUs. |

|**Abstract**| The shortest-period binary star system known to date, RX J0806.3+1527 (HM Cancri), has now been observed in the optical for more than two decades. Although it is thought to be a double degenerate binary undergoing mass transfer, an early surprise was that its orbital frequency, $f_0$, is currently increasing as the result of gravitational wave radiation. This is unusual since it was expected that the mass donor was degenerate and would expand on mass loss, leading to a decreasing $f_0$. We exploit two decades of high-speed photometry to precisely quantify the trajectory of HM Cancri, allowing us to find that $\ddot f_0$ is negative, where $\ddot f_0~=~(-5.38\pm2.10)\times10^{-27}$ Hz s$^{-2}$. Coupled with our positive frequency derivative, we show that mass transfer is counteracting gravitational-wave dominated orbital decay and that HM Cancri will turn around within $2100\pm800\,$yrs from now. We present Hubble Space Telescope ultra-violet spectra which display Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption, indicative of the presence of hydrogen accreted from the donor star. We use these pieces of information to explore a grid of permitted donor and accretor masses with the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics suite, finding models in good accordance with many of the observed properties for a cool and initially hydrogen-rich extremely-low-mass white dwarf ($\approx0.17\,$M$_\odot$) coupled with a high accretor mass white dwarf ($\approx 1.0\,$M$_\odot$). Our measurements and models affirm that HM~Cancri is still one of the brightest verification binaries for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna spacecraft. |

|**Abstract**| Star cluster formation in the early universe and their contribution to reionization remains to date largely unconstrained. Here we present JWST/NIRCam imaging of the most highly magnified galaxy known at z ~ 6, the Sunrise arc. We identify six young massive star clusters (YMCs) with measured radii spanning ~ 20 pc down to ~ 1 pc (corrected for lensing magnification), estimated stellar masses of ~ $10^{(6-7)}$ Msun, and with ages 1-30 Myr based on SED fitting to photometry measured in 8 filters extending to rest-frame 7000A. The resulting stellar mass surface densities are higher than 1000 Msun pc$^{-2}$ (up to a few $10^5$ Msun pc$^{-2}$) and their inferred dynamical ages qualify the majority of these systems as gravitationally-bound stellar clusters. The star cluster ages map the progression of star formation along the arc, with to evolved systems (>~ 10 Myr old) followed by very young clusters. The youngest stellar clusters (< 5 Myr) show evidence of prominent Hbeta + [OIII]4959,5007 emission, based on photometry, with equivalent widths larger than 1000 A rest-frame, and are hosted in a 200 pc sized star-forming complex. Such a region dominates the ionizing photon production, with a high efficiency log($\xi_{ion}$ [Hz erg$^{-1}$]) ~ 25.7. A significant fraction of the recently formed stellar mass of the galaxy (> 10-30 %) occurred in these YMCs. We speculate that such sources of ionizing radiation boost the ionizing photon production efficiency which eventually carve ionized channels that might favor the escape of Lyman continuum radiation. The survival of some of the clusters would make them the progenitors of massive and relatively metal-poor globular clusters in the local Universe. |

|*Appeared on*| *2022-11-21*|
|*Comments*| *13 pages, 2 figures. Submitted to ApJ. Comments are welcome*|
|**Abstract**| We discuss the formation and evolution of systems comprised of a low-mass ($M_\star \lesssim 4 \, \rm M_\odot$) main sequence star, orbiting a $10^5-10^7 \, \rm M_\odot$ supermassive black hole with an orbital period of order $\sim$hours, and a mild eccentricity ($e\approx0.1-0.2$), episodically shedding mass at each pericenter passage. We argue that the resulting mass transfer is likely unstable, with Roche lobe overflow initially driven by gravitational wave emission, but then being accelerated by the star's expansion in response to its mass loss, undergoing a runaway process. We show that such systems are naturally produced by two-body gravitational encounters within the inner parsec of a galaxy, followed by gravitational wave circularization and inspiral from initially highly eccentric orbits. We argue that such systems can produce recurring flares similar to the recently identified class of X-ray transients known as Quasi-Periodic Eruptions, observed at the centers of a few distant galaxies. |

|*Appeared on*| *2022-11-21*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted to the "JWST Overview" special issue of PASP*|
|**Abstract**| We describe the sources of stray light and thermal background that affect JWST observations; report actual backgrounds as measured from commissioning and early science observations; compare those background levels to pre-launch predictions; estimate the impact of the backgrounds on science performance; and explore how the backgrounds probe the achieved configuration of the deployed observatory. We find the observatory is limited by the irreducible astrophysical backgrounds, rather than scattered stray light and thermal self-emission, for all wavelengths $\lambda < 12.5$ micron, thus meeting the level 1 requirement. This result was not assured given the open architecture and thermal challenges of JWST, and is the result of meticulous attention to stray light and thermal issues in the design, construction, integration, and test phases. From background considerations alone, JWST will require less integration time in the near-infrared compared to a system that just met the stray light requirements; as such, JWST will be even more powerful than expected for deep imaging at 1--5 micron. In the mid-infrared, the measured thermal backgrounds closely match pre-launch predictions. The background near 10 micron is slightly higher than predicted before launch, but the impact on observations is mitigated by the excellent throughput of MIRI, such that instrument sensitivity will be as good as expected pre-launch. These measured background levels are fully compatible with JWST's science goals and the Cycle 1 science program currently underway. |

|**Abstract**| The cool-core galaxy cluster RXJ1720.1+2638 hosts extended radio emission near the cluster core, known as a minihalo. The origin of this emission is still debated and one piece of the puzzle has been the question of whether the supermassive black hole in the brightest central galaxy is actively powering jets. Here we present high-resolution e-MERLIN observations clearly indicating the presence of sub-kpc jets; this may have implications for the proposed origin of the minihalo emission, providing an ongoing source of relativistic electrons rather than a single burst sometime in the past, as previously assumed in simulations attempting to reproduce observational characteristics of minihalo-hosting systems. |

|**Abstract**| The formation of the large-scale structure, the evolution and distribution of galaxies, quasars, and dark matter on cosmological scales, requires numerical simulations. Differentiable simulations provide gradients of the cosmological parameters, that can accelerate the extraction of physical information from statistical analyses of observational data. The deep learning revolution has brought not only myriad powerful neural networks, but also breakthroughs including automatic differentiation (AD) tools and computational accelerators like GPUs, facilitating forward modeling of the Universe with differentiable simulations. Because AD needs to save the whole forward evolution history to backpropagate gradients, current differentiable cosmological simulations are limited by memory. Using the adjoint method, with reverse time integration to reconstruct the evolution history, we develop a differentiable cosmological particle-mesh (PM) simulation library pmwd (particle-mesh with derivatives) with a low memory cost. Based on the powerful AD library JAX, pmwd is fully differentiable, and is highly performant on GPUs. |

|**Abstract**| We investigate the influence of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback on the galaxy cold gas content and its connection to galaxy quenching in three hydrodynamical simulations of Illustris, IllustrisTNG and SIMBA. By comparing to the observed atomic and molecular neutral hydrogen measurements for central galaxies, we find that Illustris over-predicts the cold gas masses in star-forming galaxies and significantly under-predicts them for quenched galaxies. IllustrisTNG performs better in this comparison than Illustris, but quenched galaxies retain too much cold gas compared with observations. SIMBA shows good agreement with observations, by depleting the global cold gas reservoir for quenched galaxies. We find that the discrepancies in IllustrisTNG are caused by its weak kinetic AGN feedback that only redistributes the cold gas from the inner disks to the outer regions and reduces the inner cold gas densities. It agrees with observations much better when only the cold gas within the stellar disk is considered to infer the star formation rates. From dependences of cold gas reservoir on the black hole mass and Eddington ratio, we find that the cumulative energy release during the black hole growth is the dominant reason for the cold gas depletion and thus the galaxy quenching. We further measure the central stellar surface density within 1 kpc ($\Sigma_1$) for the high-resolution run of IllustrisTNG and find a tight correlation between $\Sigma_1$ and black hole mass. It suggests that the observed decreasing trend of cold gas mass with $\Sigma_1$ is also a reflection of the black hole growth. |

|**Abstract**| We report three searches for high energy neutrino emission from astrophysical objects using data recorded with IceCube between 2011 and 2020. Improvements over previous work include new neutrino reconstruction and data calibration methods. In one search, the positions of 110 a priori selected gamma-ray sources were analyzed individually for a possible surplus of neutrinos over atmospheric and cosmic background expectations. We found an excess of $79_{-20}^{+22}$ neutrinos associated with the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068 at a significance of 4.2$\,\sigma$. The excess, which is spatially consistent with the direction of the strongest clustering of neutrinos in the Northern Sky, is interpreted as direct evidence of TeV neutrino emission from a nearby active galaxy. The inferred flux exceeds the potential TeV gamma-ray flux by at least one order of magnitude. |

|**Abstract**| Magnetic free energy powers solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and the buildup of magnetic helicity might play a role in the development of unstable structures that subsequently erupt. To better understand the roles of energy and helicity in large flares and eruptions, we have characterized the evolution of magnetic energy and helicity associated with 21 X-class flares from 2010 to 2017. Our sample includes both confined and eruptive events, with 6 and 15 in each category, respectively. Using HMI vector magnetic field observations from several hours before to several hours after each event, we employ (a) the Differential Affine Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms (DAVE4VM) to determine the photospheric fluxes of energy and helicity, and (b) non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolations to estimate the coronal content of energy and helicity in source-region fields. Using Superposed Epoch analysis (SPE), we find, on average: (1) decreases in both magnetic energy and helicity, in both photospheric fluxes and coronal content, that persist for a few hours after eruptions, but no clear changes, notably in relative helicity, for confined events; (2) significant increases in the twist of photospheric fields in eruptive events, with twist uncertainties too large in confined events to constrain twist changes (and lower overall twist in confined events); and (3) on longer time scales (event time +12 hours), replenishment of free magnetic energy and helicity content to near pre-event levels for eruptive events. For eruptive events, magnetic helicity and free energy in coronal models clearly decrease after flares, with the amounts of decrease proportional to each region's pre-flare content. |

|**Abstract**| As a novel X-ray focusing technology, lobster eye micro-pore optics (MPO) feature both a wide observing field of view and true imaging capability, promising sky monitoring with significantly improved sensitivity and spatial resolution in soft X-rays. Since first proposed by Angel (1979), the optics have been extensively studied, developed and trialed over the past decades. In this Letter, we report on the first-light results from a flight experiment of the Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy ($LEIA$), a pathfinder of the wide-field X-ray telescope of the Einstein Probe mission. The piggyback imager, launched in July 2022, has a mostly un-vignetted field of view of $18.6^\circ \times 18.6^\circ $. Its spatial resolution is in the range of 4$-$7 arcmin in FWHM and the focal spot effective area is 2$-$3 cm$^2$, both showing only mild fluctuations across the field of view. We present images of the Galactic center region, Sco X-1 and the diffuse Cygnus Loop nebular taken in snapshot observations over 0.5$-$4 keV. These are truly wide-field X-ray images of celestial bodies observed, for the first time, by a focusing imaging telescope. Initial analyses of the in-flight data show excellent agreement between the observed images and the on-ground calibration and simulations. The instrument and its characterization are briefly described, as well as the flight experiment. The results provide a solid basis for the development of the present and proposed wide-field X-ray missions using lobster eye MPO. |

|**Abstract**| We report the extended GeV $\gamma$-ray emission that spatially associated with the high Galactic latitude supernova remnant (SNR) candidate - Calvera's SNR with the Pass 8 data recorded by the {\em Fermi} Large Area Telescope. The $\gamma$-ray spectrum of Calvera's SNR between 100 MeV and 1 TeV shows an evident ($\sim$ 3.4$\sigma$) spectral curvature at several tens of GeV. The multi-wavelength data can be fitted with either a leptonic model or a hadronic one. However, the leptonic model exhibits the inconsistent between the flat radio spectrum and the hard GeV $\gamma$-ray spectrum of Calvera's SNR. For the hadronic model, the spectral index of protons should be harder than 1.6. And the total energy of protons is fitted to be more than one order of magnitude higher than the explosion energy of a typical supernova, which also challenges the hadronic model. The evident spectral curvature and the absence of non-thermal X-ray emission from Calvera's SNR makes it to be an interesting source bridging young-aged SNRs with bright non-thermal X-ray emission and old-aged SNRs interacting with molecular clouds. |

|**Abstract**| The Dragonfly Nebula (G75.2$+$0.1) powered by the young pulsar J2021$+$3651 is a rare pulsar wind nebula (PWN) that shows double tori and polar jets enclosed by a bow-shock structure in X-rays. We present new radio observations of this source taken with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 6 GHz. The radio PWN has an overall size about two times as large as the X-ray counterpart, consisting of a bright main body region in the southwest, a narrow and fainter bridge region in the northeast, and a dark gap in between. The nebula shows a radio spectrum much softer than that of a typical PWN. This could be resulting from compression by the ram pressure as the system travels mildly supersonically in the interstellar medium (ISM). Our polarization maps reveal a highly ordered and complex $B$-field structure. This can be explained by a toroidal field distorted by the pulsar motion. |

|**Abstract**| Massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) play a crucial role in star formation. Given that MYSOs were previously identified based on the extended structure and the observational data for them is limited, screening the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) objects showing green features (for the common coding of the 4.6 $\mu$m band as green channel in three-color composite WISE images) will yield more MYSO candidates. Using WISE images in the whole Galactic Plane ($ 0^\circ<l<360^\circ $ and $\mid b \mid <2^\circ$), we identified sources with strong emissions at 4.6 $\mu$m band, then according to morphological features divided them into three groups. We present a catalog of 2135 WISE Green Objects (WGOs). 264 WGOs have an extended structure. 1366 WGOs show compact green feature but without extended structure. 505 WGOs have neither extended structure nor green feature, but the intensity at 4.6 $\mu$m is numerically at least 4.5 times that of 3.4 $\mu$m. According to the analysis of the coordinates of WGOs, we find WGOs are mainly distributed in $\mid l \mid< 60^\circ$, coincident with the position of the giant molecular clouds in $\mid l \mid> 60^\circ$. Matching results with various masers show that those three groups of WGOs are at different evolutionary stages. After cross-matching WGOs with published YSO survey catalogs, we infer that $\sim$50% of WGOs are samples of newly discovered YSOs. In addition, 1260 WGOs are associated with Hi-GAL sources, according to physical parameters estimated by spectral energy distribution fitting, of which 231 are classified as robust MYSOs and 172 as candidate MYSOs. |

|**Abstract**| With the measurement of the electromagnetic (EM) counterpart, a gravitational wave (GW) event could be treated as a standard siren. As a novel cosmological probe, the standard siren will bring significant implications for cosmology. In this paper, by considering the coincident detections of GW and associated $\gamma$ ray burst (GRB), we find that only about 400 GW bright standard sirens from binary neutron star mergers could be detected in a 10-year observation of the Einstein Telescope and the THESEUS satellite mission. Based on this mock sample, we investigate the implications of GW standard sirens on the interaction between dark energy and dark matter. In our analysis, four viable interacting dark energy (IDE) models, with interaction forms $Q=3\beta H \rho_{\mathrm{de}}$ and $Q=3 \beta H \rho_{\mathrm{c}}$, are considered. Compared with the traditional EM observational data such as CMB, BAO, and SN Ia, the combination of both GW and EM observations could effectively break the degeneracies between different cosmological parameters and provide more stringent cosmological fits. We also find that the GW data could play a more important role for determining the interaction in the models with $Q=3 \beta H \rho_{\mathrm{c}}$, compared with the models with $Q=3\beta H \rho_{\mathrm{de}}$. |

|**Abstract**| The KM3NeT Collaboration is constructing two large neutrino detectors in the Mediterranean Sea: ARCA, located near Sicily and aiming at neutrino astronomy, and ORCA located near Toulon and designed for the study of intrinsic neutrino properties. The two detectors together will have hundreds of Detection Units with Digital Optical Modules kept vertically by buoyancy forming a large 3D optical array for detecting the Cherenkov light produced after the neutrino interactions. To properly reconstruct the direction of the incoming neutrino, the position of the DOMs, which are not static due to the sea currents, must be monitored. For this purpose, the detector is equipped with an Acoustic Positioning System, which is composed of fixed acoustic emitters on the sea bottom, a hydrophone in each DU base, and a piezoceramic sensor in each DOM, as acoustic receivers. This network of acoustic sensors can be used not only for positioning, but also for acoustic monitoring studies such as bioacoustics, ship noise monitoring, environmental noise control, and acoustic neutrinos detection. This work explores the possibility of creating a trigger for saving the data for ultra-high-energy neutrino candidates detected acoustically by the hydrophones. The acoustic signal caused by the neutrino interaction in a fluid is a short-time duration Bipolar Pulse extremely directive and with a Fourier transform extending over a wide range of frequencies. A study of signal detection, has been done by simulating BP produced by the interaction of a UHE neutrino at 1 km from the detector at zero-degree incidence added to the experimental real acoustic data. Finally, a trigger proposal has been developed in order to record candidates of BPs and it has been tested. The number of candidates per second, precision, and recall have been monitored according to the cuts applied and parameters calculated by the algorithm. |

|**Abstract**| After in quiescence for 49 years, 4U~1730--22 became active and had two outbursts in 2021 \& 2022, the onset and tail of the outbursts were observed by NICER, which give us a peerless opportunity to study the state transition and its underlying mechanism. In this work, we take both the NS surface and accretion disk emission as the seed photons of the Comptonization and derive their spectral evolution in a bolometric luminosity range of 1\%--15\%$L_{\rm Edd}$. In the high/soft state, the inferred inner disk radius and the NS radius are consistent well, which implies that the accretion disk is close to the NS surface. For the decay stage, we report a steep change of the accretion disk emission within one day, i.e., the soft-to-hard transition, which could be due to the propeller effect and the corresponding neutron star surface magnetic field is 1.8--2.2$\times10^{8}$ G. Moreover, the inner disk radius is truncated at the corotation radius, which is similar to the propeller effect detected from 4U~1608--52. The absence of the propeller effect in the hard-to-soft state transition implies that the transition between the magnetospheric accretion and the disk accretion is not the sole cause of the state transitions. |

|**Abstract**| Weak lensing studies via cosmic voids are a promising probe of Modified Gravity (MG). The Excess Surface mass Density (ESD) is widely used as a lensing statistics in weak lensing researches. In this paper we use the ray-tracing method to study the ESD around voids in simulations based on the Cubic Galileon (CG) gravity. With the compilation of N-body simulation and ray-tracing method, changes on the structure formation and deflection angle resulting from MG can both be considered, making the extraction of lensing signals more realistic. We find good agreements between the measurement and theoretical prediction of ESD for CG gravity. Meanwhile, the effect on the deflection angle is found to be incomparable to that on the structure formation in CG, indicating an equivalence between ESD (statistics) and the projection of 3D dark matter density field for this gravity. Finally, we demonstrate that it is impossible to distinguish CG and General Relativity in our simulation with an effective survey area $\sim1550deg^2$ and a galaxy number density of $10arcmin^{-2}$, implying that void lensing statistics may not be the optimal probe on testing CG gravity. The methodology employed in this paper that combines N-body simulation and ray-tracing method can be a robust way to measure the lensing signals from simulations based on the MGs, and especially on that who significantly modifies the deflection angle. |

|**Abstract**| The current analysis is dedicated to a detailed investigation of the non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) effects influencing the formation of the Fe I 6173 A line, which is widely used by many instruments including the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager on board the Solar Orbiter. We synthesize the Stokes profiles in a snapshot of a three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the solar photosphere under both LTE and NLTE conditions. The simulation cube contains a sunspot and a plage region around it. The LTE and NLTE Stokes profiles formed in different features are compared and analysed. NLTE effects are evident in both intensity and polarization profiles. For the 6173 A line, UV overionization is the dominant NLTE mechanism, and scattering effects are much less important. In addition to Fe, an NLTE treatment of Si, Mg and Al is necessary to set the right photon density in the UV. This is found to further enhance the LTE departures compared to the case where Fe alone is treated in NLTE. These effects in the Stokes profiles survive even when the profiles are averaged spatially or sampled on a coarse wavelength grid such as that used by the SDO/HMI and other magnetographs. The deviations from the LTE profiles are stronger in the Fe I 6173 A compared to the 6301 A - 6302 A lines because in case of the latter, line scattering compensates the effect of UV overionization. Based on the nature of departures from LTE, treating the 6173 A line in LTE will likely result in an over-estimation of temperature and an under-estimation of the magnetic field strength. |

|**Abstract**| We report the discovery of MeV-GeV gamma-ray emission by the Fermi-LAT positionally coincident with the TeV pulsar wind nebula (PWN) HESS~J1554-550 within the host supernova remnant (SNR) G327.1-1.1. The gamma-ray emission is point-like and faint but significant (> 4 sigma) in the 300MeV-2TeV energy range. We report here the Fermi-LAT analysis of the observed gamma-ray emission followed by a detailed multiwavelength investigation to understand the nature of the emission. The central pulsar powering the PWN within G327.1-1.1 has not been detected in any waveband; however, it is likely embedded within the X-ray nebula, which is displaced from the center of the radio nebula. The gamma-ray emission is faint and therefore a pulsation search to determine if the pulsar may be contributing is not feasible. Prior detailed multiwavelength reports revealed an SNR system that is old, tau ~ 18,000yrs, where the interaction of the reverse shock with the PWN is underway or has recently occurred. We find that the gamma-ray emission agrees remarkably well with a detailed broadband model constructed in a prior report based on independent hydrodynamical and semi-analytic simulations of an evolved PWN. We further investigate the physical implications of the model for the PWN evolutionary stage incorporating the new Fermi-LAT data and attempt to model the distinct particle components based on a spatial separation analysis of the displaced PWN counterparts. |

|**Abstract**| We present the analysis of a spectroscopic secondary eclipse of the hottest transiting exoplanet detected to date, KELT-9b, obtained with the Wide Field Camera 3 aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. We complement these data with literature information on stellar pulsations and Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite eclipse depths of this target to obtain a broadband thermal emission spectrum. Our extracted spectrum exhibits a clear turnoff at 1.4$\mu$m. This points to H$^{-}$ bound-free opacities shaping the spectrum. To interpret the spectrum, we perform grid retrievals of self-consistent 1D equilibrium chemistry forward models, varying the composition and energy budget. The model with solar metallicity and C/O ratio provides a poor fit because the H$^{-}$ signal is stronger than expected, requiring an excess of electrons. This pushes our retrievals toward high atmospheric metallicities ($[M/H]=1.98^{+0.19}_{-0.21}$) and a C/O ratio that is subsolar by 2.4$\sigma$. We question the viability of forming such a high-metallicity planet, and therefore provide other scenarios to increase the electron density in this atmosphere. We also look at an alternative model in which we quench TiO and VO. This fit results in an atmosphere with a slightly subsolar metallicity and subsolar C/O ratio ($[M/H]=-0.22^{+0.17}_{-0.13}$, log(C/O)$=-0.34^{+0.19}_{-0.34}$). However, the required TiO abundances are disputed by recent high-resolution measurements of the same planet. |

|*Comments*| *19 pages, 8 figures*|
|**Abstract**| We have obtained simultaneous and continuous photo-polarization observations of the blazar BL Lacertae in optical and near-infrared (NIR) bands during a historical outburst from 2020 to 2021. In total, fourteen nights of observations were performed where ten observations show microvariability on timescales of a few minutes to several hours. This suggests a compact emission region, and the timescales are difficult to explain by a one-zone shock-in-jet model. Moreover, we found significant differences in the polarization degree (PD) and angle between optical and NIR bands. Nine nights showed a PD in the optical band that is greater than or equal to that in the NIR band, which can be explained by either a shock-in-jet model or the Turbulent Extreme Multi-Zone (TEMZ) model. On the other hand, five nights showed higher PD in a NIR band than an optical band, which cannot be explained by simple shock-in-jet models nor the simple TEMZ model. The observed timescales and wavelength dependency of the PD and polarization angle suggest the existence of complicated multiple emission regions such as an irregular TEMZ model. |
