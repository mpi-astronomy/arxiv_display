|**Abstract**|            We present the PHANGS-MUSE/HST-Halpha nebulae catalogue, comprising 5177 spatially resolved nebulae across 19 nearby star-forming galaxies (< 20 Mpc), based on high-resolution Halpha imaging from HST, homogenised to a fixed 10 pc resolution and sensitivity. Combined with MUSE spectroscopy, this enables robust classification of 4882 H II regions and separation of planetary nebulae and supernova remnants. Electron densities for 2544 H II regions are derived using [S II] diagnostics, and nebular sizes measured via circularised radii and second moments yield a median of 20 pc, extending to sub-parsec scales. A structural complexity score traces substructure, showing that about a third of regions are H II complexes, with a higher fraction in galaxy centres. A luminosity-size relation calibrated from the HST sample is applied to 30,790 MUSE nebulae, recovering sizes down to 1 pc. Observed sizes exceed classical Stromgren radii, implying typical volume filling factors of 0.22. We associate 3349 H II regions with stellar populations from PHANGS-HST, finding median ages of 3 Myr and masses of 4-5 log(Msun). The dataset provides a detailed, spatially resolved link between nebular structure and ionising sources, serving as a benchmark for future studies of feedback, diffuse ionised gas, and star formation regulation in the interstellar medium. The full catalogue is made publicly available in machine-readable format.         |

|**Abstract**|            Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are the link between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes. Gravitational waves have started unveiling a population of IMBHs in the $\sim 100-300 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ range. Here, we investigate the formation of IMBHs from very massive stars (VMSs, $>100\,{} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$). We calculate new VMS models that account for the transition from optically thin to optically thick winds, and study how this enhanced mass loss affects IMBH formation and the black hole mass function at intermediate and high metallicity ($Z=10^{-4}-0.02$). We show that optically thick winds suppress the formation of IMBHs from direct VMS collapse at metallicities $Z>0.001$, one order of magnitude lower than predicted by previous models. Our models indicate that the stellar progenitors of GW231123 must have had a metallicity $Z<0.002$, if the primary black hole formed via direct VMS collapse.         |

|| D. Wang, <mark>J. Li</mark>, D. Lai |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-15*|
|*Comments*| *10 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, submitted to ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            Exoplanetary systems hosting multiple low-mass planets are thought to have experienced dynamical instability, during which planet-planet collisions and mergers occur; these collisions can impart substantial amount of angular momentum to the merger remnants, changing the obliquities of the resulting planets significantly. In this work, we carry out a series of $N$-body experiments to investigate the spin magnitude $(|\vec{S}|)$ and obliquity $(\theta_{\rm SL})$ distributions of low-mass exoplanets that have gone through planetary collisions. In our fiducial super-Earth (with $m=3M_{\oplus}$, $R=1.3R_{\oplus}$) and mini-Neptune systems (with $m=9M_{\oplus}$, $R=2.5R_{\oplus}$), the collision products follow a nearly uniform distribution in $\cos{\theta_{\rm SL}}$ and the spin-magnitude distribution is approximately linear in $|\vec{S}|$. Parameter studies and theoretical analysis show that increasing planetary radii or masses, or decreasing the initial planet-planet mutual inclinations, tend to polarize the obliquity distribution toward alignment or anti-alignment (i.e., excess probability near $\cos{\theta_{\rm SL}}=\pm1$). Experiments with initially two-planet and three-planet systems produce qualitatively similar outcomes, suggesting that the trends in this study may generalize to systems with higher planetary multiplicities.         |

|| <mark>Y. Wu</mark>, S. P. Zwart, H. Dijkstra |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-15*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in New Astronomy*|
|**Abstract**|            Planetary obliquity (axial tilt) plays an important role in regulating the climate evolution and habitability of water-covered planets. Despite the suspicion of large obliquities in several exoplanetary systems, this phenomenon remains hard to observe directly. We aimed to study the effect of mass, obliquity, and rotation on the steady state climate of water-covered planets. We simulated the climate evolution of such planets with varying obliquities, rotational speed, and mass using a general circulation model (GCM) of intermediate complexity, assuming aqua-planet configurations. High obliquity supports an asymmetry between the equilibrium climatological conditions in the northern and southern hemispheres. The polar temperature ratio deviates further from unity with increasing obliquity and rotation rate. Cloud coverage patterns also shift with obliquity, displaying distinct latitudinal bands and increased cloudiness in the warmer hemisphere. The climate of habitable-zone aqua-planets turns out to be sensitive to changes in obliquity and rotation rate, but are independent of planet mass. Our results highlight the importance of considering these factors when assessing the surface conditions of exoplanets. As a consequence, surface condition asymmetries in water-world exo-planets can be used to infer the planet's obliquity and rotation rate.         |

|| E. Gazda, et al. -- incl., <mark>Y. Wang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-15*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            The Prime-Cam instrument of the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST) at the CCAT Observatory will conduct sensitive millimeter to submillimeter surveys for a range of astrophysical and cosmological sciences. Prime-Cam will use kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) sensitive to multiple frequency bands spanning 280--850 GHz. With over 100,000 sensors under development, these KID arrays will soon form the largest submillimeter focal plane ever built. With fixed microwave tones probing amplitude and phase modulations in the KIDs due to incoming radiation, challenges arise in determining the optimal readout settings, especially under varying atmospheric loading. Realizing the science goals of FYST requires operating the detectors at optimal performance and determining accurate responsivities, which depend on readout tone placement and power. To address these challenges, we present laboratory measurements of sample pixels from the 280 GHz TiN and Al arrays using a blackbody cold load to simulate observing conditions. These measurements probe detector responsivity and noise across varying optical loading, tone power, and tone placement, providing the foundation to guide in situ calibration and operation of the $>$100,000 KIDs. We characterize detector sensitivity via the Noise Equivalent Power (NEP) as a function of readout tone power and placement, and measure the impact of detuning due to varying optical power on the NEP. Our test setup and methodology will inform the commissioning of Prime-Cam, in situ detector calibration procedures, the cadence of probe tone resetting, and potential design refinements for future arrays, supporting FYST's planned first light in 2026.         |

|| T. Yang, et al. -- incl., <mark>L. Xie</mark>, <mark>Y. Wu</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            JWST observations reveal numerous quiescent galaxies (QGs) at high redshift ($z \sim 4-8$), challenging models of early galaxy formation and quenching. Accurate number density estimates are crucial for comparison with theory but remain uncertain. We systematically study QGs at $0.5 < z < 8$ using a mass-complete sample from the JWST/PRIMER survey with deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging. The MIRI data, probing rest-frame near-infrared at $z \sim 3-8$, are vital for robust stellar mass measurement and QG identification. We find that nearly all photometrically selected, point-like QG candidates located in the UVJ QG region are actually "Little Red Dots", for which the UVJ colors were wrongly estimated due to inaccurate photometric redshift estimation. MIRI reduces significantly contamination to high-mass QGs from star-forming galaxies, yielding lower number densities than previous studies. The evolution of QG number density is strongly mass-dependent. The density of high-mass QGs ($\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) > 10.3$) decreases rapidly from $n = 1\times10^{-5}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z=3-4$ to $n=2\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z = 4-5$, becoming negligible ($n \lesssim 10^{-6}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ ) at $z > 5$. Conversely, low-mass QGs ($9<\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot})<10.3$) maintain a nearly constant number density ($n\sim3\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$) across $z = 4-8$. This suggests low-mass QGs at $z > 4$ are likely temporarily quenched, akin to mini-quenched galaxies. Comparison with major hydrodynamical and semi-analytical models shows most underestimate high-mass QG densities at $z>4$ and fail to reproduce the constant low-mass QG density at $z>5$.         |

|| <mark>J. Li</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-15*|
|*Comments*| *21 pages, 7 figures. Accepted by ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            We observed NH3 metastable inversion lines from (3, 3) to (18, 18) toward G0.66-0.13 in the Galactic center with the Shanghai Tianma 65m radio telescope and Yebes 40 m telescope. Highly-excited lines of NH3 (17, 17), (18, 18) were detected in emission for the first time in the interstellar medium, with upper energy levels up to 3100 K. Mapping observations reveal widespread hot molecular gas traced by NH3 (13, 13) toward G0.66-0.13. The rotation temperatures of hot gas traced by NH3 exceed 400 K, which amounts to five percent of the total NH3 in the Galactic Center. Hot gas (>400 K) and warm gas (100-140 K) are found in distinct clumps, with the hot gas located at the interfacing regions between different warm clouds. The theory of intermittency in turbulence reproduces the complex temperature structure in the central molecular zone, especially the hot gas observed here. The results presented here demonstrate that turbulence heating dominates the heating of the molecular gas in the Central Molecular Zone, while the turbulence is induced by the shear-motion of molecular clouds under the gravitational potential of the nuclear star clusters and the supermassive black hole. Our results suggest that shear-induced turbulence heating could be a widespread factor influencing galactic evolution.         |

|| Y.-M. Zhang, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-15*|
|*Comments*| *12 pages, 4 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            The $H_0$ tension has become one of the most significant challenges in modern cosmology. The recent DESI DR2 data has shown a significant preference for dynamical dark energy, yet this has further exacerbated the $H_0$ tension. In this work, we explore the potential of new interacting dark energy models ($\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM and $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM) to alleviate the $H_0$ tension. We perform observational constraints using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescop, and type Ia supernova data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus, as well as the SH0ES data. From our analysis, we observe the dynamical scale parameter of the cosmological constant, $\delta_{\Lambda} = -0.410^{+0.140}_{-0.120}$, in the $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM model using the CMB+DESI+SH0ES data, which deviates from $\Lambda$CDM at the $3.2\sigma$ level. Due to the anti-correlation between $\delta_{\Lambda}$ and $H_0$, a negative $\delta_{\Lambda}$ results in a higher inferred $H_0$. Consequently, we obtain $H_0 = 71.90 \pm 1.00~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the $H_0$ tension to $0.8\sigma$. Even without SH0ES, the CMB+DESI data alone still alleviate the $H_0$ tension to $1.7\sigma$. Overall, the $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM model not only deviates from the $\Lambda$CDM model but also demonstrates a significant capability to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.         |

|| S. Mondal, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Shi</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-15*|

|**Abstract**|            Decades of solar coronal observations have provided substantial evidence for accelerated particles in the corona. In most cases, the location of particle acceleration can be roughly identified by combining high spatial and temporal resolution data from multiple instruments across a broad frequency range. In almost all cases, these nonthermal particles are associated with quiescent active regions, flares, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Only recently, some evidence of the existence of nonthermal electrons at locations outside these well-accepted regions has been found. Here, we report for the first time multiple cases of transient nonthermal emissions, in the heliocentric range of $\sim 3-7R_\odot$, which do not have any obvious counterparts in other wavebands, like white-light and extreme ultra-violet. These detections were made possible by the regular availability of high dynamic range low-frequency radio images from the Owens Valley Radio Observatory's Long Wavelength Array. While earlier detections of nonthermal emissions at these high heliocentric distances often had comparable extensions in the plane-of-sky, they were primarily been associated with radio CMEs, unlike the cases reported here. Thus, these results add on to the evidence that the middle corona is extremely dynamic and contains a population of nonthermal electrons, which is only becoming visible with high dynamic range low-frequency radio images.         |
