|**Abstract**|            Power spectra (PS) of high-resolution images of M51 (NGC 5194) taken with the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope have been examined for evidence of disk thickness in the form of a change in slope between large scales, which map two-dimensional correlated structures, and small scales, which map three-dimensional correlated structures. Such a slope change is observed here in H-alpha, and possibly Pa-alpha, using average PS of azimuthal intensity scans that avoid bright peaks. The physical scale of the slope change occurs at ~120 pc and ~170 pc for these two transitions, respectively. A radial dependence in the shape of the H-alpha PS also suggests that the length scale drops from ~180 pc at 5 kpc, to ~90 pc at 2 kpc, to ~25 pc in the central ~kpc. We interpret these lengths as comparable to the thicknesses of the star-forming disk traced by HII regions. The corresponding emission measure is ~100 times larger than what is expected from the diffuse ionized gas. PS of JWST Mid-IR Instrument (MIRI) images in 8 passbands have more gradual changes in slope, making it difficult to determine a specific value of the thickness for this emission.         |

|**Abstract**|            The study of multiple molecular spectral lines in gas infalling sources can provide the physical and chemical properties of these sources and help us estimate their evolutionary stages. We report line detections within the 3 mm band using the FTS wide-sideband mode of the IRAM 30 m telescope toward 20 gas-infalling sources. Using XCLASS, we identify the emission lines of up to 22 molecular species (including a few isotopologues) and one hydrogen radio recombination line in these sources. H$^{13}$CO$^+$, HCO$^+$, HCN, HNC, c-C$_3$H$_2$, and CCH lines are detected in 15 sources. We estimate the rotation temperatures and column densities of these molecular species using the LTE radiative transfer model, and compare the molecular abundances of these sources with those from nine high-mass star-forming regions reported in previous studies and with those from the chemical model. Our results suggest that G012.79-0.20, G012.87-0.22 clump A and B, and G012.96-0.23 clump A may be in the high-mass protostellar object stage, while sources with fewer detected species may be in the earlier evolutionary stage. Additionally, the CCH and c-C$_3$H$_2$ column densities in our sources reveal a linear correlation, with a ratio of N(CCH)/N(c-C$_3$H$_2$) = 89.2$\pm$5.6, which is higher than the ratios reported in the literature. When considering only sources with lower column densities, this ratio decreases to 29.0$\pm$6.1, consistent with those of diffuse clouds. Furthermore, a comparison between the N(CCH)/N(c-C$_3$H$_2$) ratio and the sources' physical parameters reveals a correlation, with sources exhibiting higher ratios tending to have higher kinetic temperatures and H$_2$ column densities.         |

|| G. Gu, et al. -- incl., <mark>Y. Wang</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            We investigate whether dark energy deviates from the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM) by analyzing baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Data Release 1 (DR1) and Data Release 2 (DR2) of DESI observations, in combination with Type Ia supernovae (SNe) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance information. We find that with the larger statistical power and wider redshift coverage of the DR2 dataset the preference for dynamical dark energy does not decrease and remains at approximately the same statistical significance as for DESI~DR1. Employing both a shape-function reconstruction and non-parametric methods with a correlation prior derived from Horndeski theory, we consistently find that the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ evolves with redshift. While DESI DR1 and DR2 BAO data alone provide modest constraints, combining them with independent SNe samples (PantheonPlus, Union3, and the DES 5-year survey) and a CMB distance prior strengthens the evidence for dynamical dark energy. Bayesian model-selection tests show moderate support for dark energy dynamics when multiple degrees of freedom in $w(z)$ are allowed, pointing to increasing tension with $\Lambda$CDM at a level of roughly $3\sigma$ (or more in certain data combinations). Although the methodology adopted in this work is different from those used in companion DESI papers, we find consistent results, demonstrating the complementarity of dark energy studies performed by the DESI collaboration. Although possible systematic effects must be carefully considered, it currently seems implausible that $\Lambda$CDM will be rescued by future high-precision surveys, such as the complete DESI, Euclid, and next-generation CMB experiments. These results therefore highlight the possibility of new physics driving cosmic acceleration and motivate further investigation into dynamical dark energy models.         |

|| A. M. A. Fadul, et al. -- incl., <mark>T. Suhasaria</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in the form of prebiotic molecules are potentially building blocks of life. Using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 7 observations in spectral scanning mode, we carried out a deep search for COMs within the disk of V883 Ori, covering frequency ranges of $\sim$ 348 - 366 GHz. V883 Ori is an FUor object currently undergoing an accretion burst, which increases its luminosity and consequently increases the temperature of the surrounding protoplanetary disk, facilitating the detection of COMs in the gas phase. We identified 26 molecules, including 14 COMs and 12 other molecules, with first detection in this source of the molecules: CH3OD, H2C17O, and H213CO. We searched for multiple nitrogen-bearing COMs, as CH3CN had been the only nitrogen-bearing COM that has been identified so far in this source. We also detected CH3CN, and tentatively detect CH3CH2CN, CH2CHCN, CH3OCN, CH3NCO, and NH2CHO. We compared the abundances relative to CH3OH with those in the handful of objects with previous detections of these species: the Class 0 protostars IRAS 16293-2422 A, IRAS 16293-2422 B and B1-c, the high-mass star-forming region Sagittarius B2 (North), the Solar System comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and the protoplanetary disk of Oph-IRS 48. We report $\sim$ 1 to 3 orders of magnitude higher abundances compared to Class 0 protostars and $\sim$ 1 to 3 orders of magnitude lower abundances compared to the protoplanetary disk, Sagittarius B2 (North), and 67P/C-G. These results indicate that the protoplanetary disk phase could contribute to build up of COMs.         |
