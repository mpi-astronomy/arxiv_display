|**Abstract**|            We seek to quantify the fidelity with which modern population syntheses reproduce observations in view of their use as predictive tools. We compared synthetic populations from the Generation 3 Bern Model of Planet Formation and Evolution (core accretion, solar-type host stars) and the HARPS/Coralie radial velocity sample. We biased the synthetic planet population according to the completeness of the observed data and performed quantitative statistical comparisons and systematically identified agreements and differences. Our nominal population reproduces many of the main features of the HARPS planets: two main groups of planets (close-in sub-Neptunes and distant giants), a bimodal mass function with a less populated `desert', an observed mean multiplicity of about 1.6, and several key correlations. The remaining discrepancies point to areas that are not fully captured in the model. For instance, we find that the synthetic population has 1) in absolute terms too many planets by ~70%, 2) a `desert' that is too deep by ~60%, 3) a relative excess of giant planets by ~40%, 4) planet eccentricities that are on average too low by a factor of about two (median of 0.07 versus 0.15), and 5) a metallicity effect that is too weak. Finally, the synthetic planets are overall too close to the star compared to the HARPS sample. The differences allowed us to find model parameters that better reproduce the observed planet masses, for which we computed additional synthetic populations. We find that physical processes appear to be missing and that planets may originate on wider orbits than our model predicts. Mechanisms leading to higher eccentricities and slower disc-limited gas accretion also seem necessary. We advocate that theoretical models should make a quantitative comparison between the many current and future large surveys to better understand the origins of planetary systems.

|**Abstract**|            Context. Medium-resolution IFS, such as MUSE at the VLT, are equipped to detect the emission lines of faint accreting companions when associated with dedicated stellar halo subtraction methods. We recently proposed a new approach based on polynomial modulations of a stellar spectrum estimate across the field of view, with orthogonal polynomials and lines masking. Aims. We seek to highlight and quantify analytically and on real data the benefits of this new approach over the one classically used, particularly with regard to distortions of the extracted spectra. Methods. We carried out analytical calculations based on simple toy models. Simulations of the most extreme situations identified were used to highlight these problems and corrections. Archival VLT/MUSE data of the young PDS70 and HTLup systems were used to vet the detection and characterization capabilities using on-sky observations. New images of the YSES1 planetary system were used to further illustrate the gains. Results. We show that the state-of-the-art method, based on low-pass filtering, can lead to the self-subtraction of the emission lines and modify the neighboring continua. We show that the proposed technique corrects these characterization problems, while maintaining the same detection capabilities. The two protoplanets PDS70 b and c were detected with 5sigma significance. The Halpha line estimate of the HTLup B stellar companion was improved by ~30% for the integrated flux and by ~8% for the 10%-width. As for YSES1 b, we found it uniquely displays a combination of Halpha, Hbeta, CaII H&K triplet, and HeI lines in emission. Conclusions. The proposed method better preserves the spectral information, notably the emission line fluxes and profiles, while achieving similar detection performance. Based on a linear and parametric approach, it can be extended and/or combined with additional faint signal search algorithms.         |

|**Abstract**|            In this study, we report conclusive evidence for an ancient star cluster that has been accreted by the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). By leveraging observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we investigate the chrono-dynamical structure of a sample of seven old star clusters within the LMC in a self-consistent way. The multi-epoch nature of the dataset allowed the determination of high-precision proper motions for the clusters. Employing an isochrone-fitting methodology, we additionally infer from the deep high-resolution HST data homogeneous and robust estimates for their distances, ages and metallicities. Supplementing these data with literature line-of-sight velocities, we investigate the full 3-dimensional dynamics of the clusters within the frame of the LMC. With respect to the other clusters in our sample, NGC 1841 depicts a peculiar case. Its position in the age-metallicity plane, that makes it about 1 Gyr younger than the other metal-poor LMC clusters, but also its dynamical properties with a radial orbit almost perpendicular to the LMC disc plane, clearly advocates for a different origin. We thus conclude that NGC 1841 has likely been accreted by the LMC from a smaller galaxy. The other clusters in our sample show disc-like kinematics, with the case of NGC 2210 being peculiar, based on its inclined orbit. Their coherent age-metallicity relation closely resembles that of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus globular clusters, thus suggesting a similar early evolution for the two dwarf galaxies. We do not find clear-cut chrono-kinematic evidence that NGC 2005 has been accreted by the LMC as suggested by a previous study based on its chemical abundance pattern. Regardless of its nature, its very old age illustrates that peculiar chemical evolutions already emerge at very early times.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a first large-scale kinematic map of $\sim$50,000 young OB stars ($T_{\rm eff} \geq 10,000$ K), based on BOSS spectroscopy from the Milky Way Mapper OB program in the ongoing Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V). Using photogeometric distances, line-of-sight velocities and Gaia DR3 proper motions, we map 3D Galactocentric velocities across the Galactic plane to $\sim$5 kpc from the Sun, with a focus on radial motions ($v_R$). Our results reveal mean radial motion with amplitudes of $\pm 30$ km/s that are coherent on kiloparsec scales, alternating between inward and outward motions. These $\bar{v}_R$ amplitudes are considerably higher than those observed for older, red giant populations. These kinematic patterns show only a weak correlation with spiral arm over-densities. Age estimates, derived from MIST isochrones, indicate that 85% of the sample is younger than $\sim300$ Myr and that the youngest stars ($\le 30$ Myr) align well with density enhancements. The age-dependent $\bar{v}_R$ in Auriga makes it plausible that younger stars exhibits different velocity variations than older giants. The origin of the radial velocity features remains uncertain, and may result from a combination of factors, including spiral arm dynamics, the Galactic bar, resonant interactions, or phase mixing following a perturbation. The present analysis is based on approximately one-third of the full target sample. The completed survey will enable a more comprehensive investigation of these features and a detailed dynamical interpretation.         |

|**Abstract**|            Star clusters are valuable indicators of galaxy evolution, offering insights into the buildup of stellar populations across cosmic time. Understanding intrinsic star cluster populations of dwarf galaxies is particularly important given their role in the hierarchical growth of larger systems. Using Euclid Early Release Observation data, we study star clusters in two star-forming dwarf irregulars in the Local Group, NGC 6822 and IC 10 [$M_\star \sim$ (1--4) $\times10^8 M_\odot$]. With Euclid, clusters are resolved into individual stars across the main bodies and haloes of both galaxies. Visual inspection of $I_E$ images uncovers 30 new cluster candidates in NGC 6822 and 16 in IC 10, from compact to extended clusters. We re-evaluate literature candidates, producing combined catalogues of 52 (NGC 6822) and 71 (IC 10) clusters with confidence-based classifications. We present homogeneous photometry in $I_E$, $Y_E$, $J_E$, $H_E$, and archival UBVRI data, alongside size measurements and properties from BAGPIPES SED fitting. Synthetic cluster injection shows our sample is $\sim 50$% complete to $M \lesssim 10^3 M_\odot$ for ages $\lesssim 100$ Myr, and to $M \lesssim 3\times10^4 M_\odot$ for $\sim 10$ Gyr. IC 10 has more young clusters than NGC 6822, extending to higher masses, consistent with its starburst nature. Both dwarfs host several old massive ($\gtrsim 10^5 M_\odot$) clusters, including an exceptional $1.3 \times 10^6 M_\odot$ cluster in NGC 6822's outskirts. In NGC 6822, we identify a previously undetected, old, extended cluster ($R_h = 12.4 \pm 0.11$ pc). Using well-defined criteria, we identify 11 candidate GCs in NGC 6822 and eight in IC 10. Both galaxies have high specific frequencies ($S_N$) but remain consistent with known GC scaling relations at low luminosity.         |

|**Abstract**|            We studied C/2025 D1 (Groeller), a long-period comet with an unprecedented perihelion distance of 14.1 au, using archival observations. The data reveals that it had been active at inbound heliocentric distances $r_{\rm H} \gtrsim 20$ au. Initially, the comet intrinsically brightened at $r_{\rm H} \gtrsim 16$ au, with brightening parameters comparable to those of other long-period comets. However, observations after late 2023 showed a gradual decay, despite the inbound trajectory of the comet. To our knowledge, such behaviours have not been observed for other long-period comets at similar heliocentric distances. We speculate that this might be linked to the onset of CO$_{2}$ sublimation and/or crystallisation processes. The surface brightness profile of the coma indicates a steady-state mass loss, implying supervolatile sublimation as the primary driver of the observed activity. Despite changes in the orbital plane angle, the circularly symmetric coma persisted throughout the observed period, indicative of the dominance of large grains in the coma. Assuming the activity trend is independent of bandpass, we found that comet was redder than many other solar system comets. Our model-dependent constraint estimates the nucleus radius to be $\gtrsim\!0.4$ km. We performed astrometric measurements, refined the orbital solution, and derived the original and future orbits of the comet. Our N-body integration, accounting for the Galactic tide, strongly favours that the comet is dynamically new, with its previous perihelion at $\gtrsim\!60$ au from the Sun $\gtrsim\!6$ Myr ago. It is highly likely that the comet will be lost from our solar system after the current apparition.         |

|**Abstract**|            Polarimetric data provide key insights into infrared emission mechanisms in the inner disks of YSOs and the details of dust formation around AGB stars. While polarization measurements are well-established in radio interferometry, they remain challenging at visible and near-infrared due to the significant time-variable birefringence introduced by the complex optical beamtrain. In this study, we characterize instrumental polarization effects within the optical path of the CHARA Array, focusing on the H-band MIRC-X and K-band MYSTIC beam combiners. Using Jones matrix formalism, we developed a comprehensive model describing diattenuation and retardance across the array. By applying this model to an unpolarized calibrator, we derived the instrumental parameters for both MIRC-X and MYSTIC. Our results show differential diattenuation consistent with >= 97% reflectivity per aluminum-coated surface at 45 deg incidence. The differential retardance exhibits small wavelength-dependent variations, in some cases larger than we expected. Notably, telescope W2 exhibits a significantly larger phase shift in the Coude path, attributable to a fixed aluminum mirror (M4) used in place of deformable mirrors present on the other telescopes during the observing run. We also identify misalignments in the LiNbO_3 birefringent compensator plates on S1 (MIRC-X) and W2 (MYSTIC). After correcting for night-to-night offsets, we achieve calibration accuracies of $\pm$ 3.4% in visibility ratio and $\pm$ 1.4 deg in differential phase for MIRC-X, and $\pm$ 5.9% and $\pm$ 2.4 deg, respectively, for MYSTIC. Given that the differential intrinsic polarization of spatially resolved sources, such as AGB stars and YSOs, typically greater than these instrumental uncertainties, our results demonstrate that CHARA is now capable of achieving high-accuracy measurements of intrinsic polarization in astrophysical targets.         |
