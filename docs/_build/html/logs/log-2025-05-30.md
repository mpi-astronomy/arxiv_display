|**Abstract**|            Euclid is delivering optical and near-infrared imaging data over 14,000 deg$^2$ on the sky at spatial resolution and surface brightness levels that can be used to understand the morphological transformation of galaxies within groups and clusters. Using the Early Release Observations (ERO) of the Perseus cluster, we demonstrate the capability offered by Euclid in studying the nature of perturbations for galaxies in clusters. Filamentary structures are observed along the discs of two spiral galaxies with no extended diffuse emission expected from tidal interactions at surface brightness levels of $\sim$ $30\,{\rm mag}\,{\rm arcsec}^{-2}$. The detected features exhibit a good correspondence in morphology between optical and near-infrared wavelengths, with a surface brightness of $\sim$ $25\,{\rm mag}\,{\rm arcsec}^{-2}$, and the knots within the features have sizes of $\sim$ 100 pc, as observed through $I_E$ imaging. Using the Euclid, CFHT, UVIT, and LOFAR $144\,{\rm MHz}$ radio continuum observations, we conduct a detailed analysis to understand the origin of the detected features. We constructed the \textit{Euclid} $I_E-Y_E$, $Y_E-H_E$, and CFHT $u - r$, $g - i$ colour-colour plane and showed that these features contain recent star formation events, which are also indicated by their H$\alpha$ and NUV emissions. Euclid colours alone are insufficient for studying stellar population ages in unresolved star-forming regions, which require multi-wavelength optical imaging data. The morphological shape, orientation, and mean age of the stellar population, combined with the presence of extended radio continuum cometary tails can be consistently explained if these features have been formed during a recent ram-pressure stripping event. This result further confirms the exceptional qualities of Euclid in the study of galaxy evolution in dense environments.         |

|**Abstract**|            Binary systems consisting of an early type star and a black hole (BH) are crucial for understanding various astrophysical phenomena, particularly the origins of detected gravitational wave sources. Be binary systems are expected to represent a key evolutionary stage in hosting BHs. However, while hundreds of Be X-ray binaries are known, the only confirmed BH candidate in a Be binary remains highly controversial. We report the discovery of ALS 8814, a Be star-BH binary with a moderately eccentric ($e = 0.23$) and wide orbit ($P = 176.6$ days), revealed by the radial velocity (RV) measurement of the visible Be star. Our analysis, combining flux-calibrated spectra in the Balmer discontinuity region and spectral template matching, yields a mass of $11.2^{+1.4}_{-1.2}$ $M_\odot$ for the Be star. The minimum mass of the unseen companion, assuming an edge-on inclination ($i = 90^{\circ}$), is $9.8\pm 0.7\,M_\odot$. We rule out the presence of non-degenerate companions in ALS 8814, indicating that it can only be a BH. This discovery represents a robust case of a Be-BH binary, identified purely through precise RV measurements from a single set of lines. The extremely low peculiar velocity of ALS 8814 suggests that the BH is formed via a direct core-collapse with a negligible natal kick, implying an almost perfect alignment between the Be star's spin and the orbital plane. In this context, the binary's inclination angle is estimated to be 22$^{\circ}$-49$^{\circ}$ by analyzing the shallow double-peaked profile of the H$\alpha$ emission line. This inclination range corresponds to a BH mass estimate between $15\,M_\odot$ and $58\,M_\odot$. As the only unambiguous Be-BH binary system known to date, ALS 8814 provides valuable constraints on the BH formation in a binary system with a high-mass companion.         |
