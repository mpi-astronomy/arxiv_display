|**Abstract**|            Selection effects, such as interstellar extinction and varying survey depth, complicate efforts to determine the gravitational potential - and thus the distribution of baryonic and dark matter - throughout the Milky Way galaxy using stellar kinematics. We present a new variant of the "Deep Potential" method of determining the gravitational potential from a snapshot of stellar positions and velocities that does not require any modeling of spatial selection functions. Instead of modeling the full six-dimensional phase-space distribution function $f\left(\vec{x},\vec{v}\right)$ of observed kinematic tracers, we model the conditional velocity distribution $p\left(\vec{v}\mid\vec{x}\right)$, which is unaffected by a purely spatial selection function. We simultaneously learn the gravitational potential $\Phi\left(\vec{x}\right)$ and the underlying spatial density of the entire tracer population $n\left(\vec{x}\right)$ - including unobserved stars - using the collisionless Boltzmann equation under the stationarity assumption. The advantage of this method is that unlike the spatial selection function, all of the quantities we model, $p\left(\vec{v}\mid\vec{x}\right)$, $\Phi\left(\vec{x}\right)$, and $n\left(\vec{x}\right)$, typically vary smoothly in both position and velocity. We demonstrate that this "conditional" Deep Potential method is able to accurately recover the gravitational potential in a mock dataset with a complex three-dimensional dust distribution that imprints fine angular structure on the selection function. Because we do not need to model the spatial selection function, our new method can effectively scale to large, complex datasets while using relatively few parameters, and is thus well suited to Gaia data.         |

|| A. C. Gómez, et al. -- incl., <mark>S. Bosman</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-12-03*|
|*Comments*| *14 pages, 5 figures. Accepted in A&A*|
|**Abstract**|            We present new MIRI F560W, F770W and F1000W imaging of GN-z11, extending the previous rest-frame coverage from 0.38 to 0.86$\mu$m. We report significant detections (14$\sigma$) in the F560W and F770W images, and a marginal detection (3.2$\sigma$) in F1000W. Here, we analyse its SED combining new MIRI imaging data with archival NIRSpec/Prism and MRS spectroscopy, and NIRCam imaging. The continuum emission shows a flat energy distribution, in f$_\nu$, up to 0.5$\mu$m, compatible with the presence of a mixed stellar population of young (4$\pm$1 Myr) and mature (63$\pm$23 Myr) stars that also account for the [O III], H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ emission lines. The continuum at rest-frame 0.66$\mu$m shows a 36$\pm$3% flux excess above the predicted flux for a mixed stellar population, pointing to the presence of an additional source contributing at these wavelengths. This excess increases to 91$\pm$28% at rest-frame 0.86$\mu$m, although with a large uncertainty due to the marginal detection in the F1000W filter. We consider that hot dust emission in the dusty torus around a type 2 AGN could be responsible for the observed excess. Alternatively, this excess could be due to hot dust emission or to a photoluminiscence dust process (Extended Red Emission, ERE) under the extreme UV radiation field, as observed in some local metal-poor galaxies and in young compact starbursts. The presence of a type 1 AGN is not supported by the observed SED since high-z QSOs contribute at wavelengths above rest-frame 1$\mu$m, and an additional ad-hoc red source would be required to explain the observed flux excess at 0.66 and 0.86$\mu$m. Additional deep MIRI imaging covering the rest-frame near-IR are needed to confirm the flux detection at 10$\mu$m with higher significance, and to discriminate between the different hot dust emission in the extreme starburst and AGN scenarios with MIRI imaging at longer wavelengths.         |

|**Abstract**|            The chemical abundance of the interstellar medium sets the initial conditions for star formation and provides a probe of chemical galaxy evolution models. However, unresolved inhomogeneities in the electron temperature can lead to a systematic underestimation of the abundances. We aim to directly test this effect. We use the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper to spatially map the physical conditions of the Trifid Nebula (M 20), a Galactic H II region ionized by a single mid-type O star, at 0.24 pc resolution. We exploit various emission lines (e.g., Hydrogen recombination lines and collisionally excited lines, including also faint auroral lines) and compute spatially resolved maps of [O II] and [S II] electron densities; [N II], [O II], [S II], [S III] electron temperatures; and the ionic oxygen abundances. We find internal variations of electron density that result from the ionization front, along with a negative radial gradient. However, we do not find strong gradients or structures in the electron temperature and the total oxygen abundance, making the Trifid Nebula a relatively homogeneous H II region at the observed spatial scale. We compare these spatially resolved properties with equivalent integrated measurements of the Trifid Nebula and find no significant variations between integrated and spatially resolved conditions. This isolated H II region, ionized by a single O-star, represents a test case of an ideal Strömgren sphere. The physical conditions in the Trifid Nebula behave as expected, with no significant differences between integrated and resolved measurements.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2025-12-03*|

|**Abstract**|            We analyze the properties of satellite galaxies around 1,024 Milky Way-mass hosts from the DREAMS Project, simulated within a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Utilizing the TNG galaxy-formation model, the DREAMS simulations incorporate both baryonic physics and cosmological uncertainties for a large sample of galaxies with diverse environments and formation histories. We investigate the relative impact of the physical uncertainty from the galaxy-formation model on predicted satellite properties using four metrics: the satellite stellar mass function, radial distribution, inner slope of dark matter density profile, and stellar half-light radius. We compare these predictions to observations from the SAGA Survey and the DREAMS N-body simulations and find that uncertainties from baryonic physics modeling are subdominant to the scatter arising from halo-to-halo variance. Where baryonic modeling does affect satellites, the supernova wind energy has the largest effect on the satellite properties that we investigate. Specifically, increased supernova wind energy suppresses the stellar mass of satellites and results in more extended stellar half-light radii. The adopted wind speed has only a minor impact, and other astrophysical and cosmological parameters show no measurable effect. Our findings highlight the robustness of satellite properties against uncertainties in baryonic physics modeling.         |

|**Abstract**|            Kappa Velorum (Markeb, HD 81188) is one of the brightest stars in the Southern sky and has long been known to be a single-lined spectroscopic binary. The binary mass function is large, $f(M)=1.15\ M_\odot$, suggesting that the bright (V=2.5) B2IV star may host a dark, compact object companion. We use VLTI GRAVITY observations to definitively test this possibility by directly resolving the binary. We detect a main sequence B star companion and rule out the compact object scenario. By combining the relative astrometric orbit and archival radial velocities, we report an updated precise characterization of the orbit (period $P=116.795\pm0.002$ d, eccentricity $e=0.1764\pm0.0004$, inclination $i=74.04\pm0.01^{\circ}$) and estimate the masses of the B stars. Using the original Hipparcos parallax measurement $\varpi = 6.05\pm0.48$ mas, we find $M_1 = 10^{+4}_{-2}\ M_\odot$ and $M_2 = 6.9\pm1.0\ M_\odot$. The uncertainties on the masses are primarily driven by the uncertain parallax, which we find is likely biased by the orbital motion. We use an archival UVES spectrum and MIST evolutionary tracks to refine our mass estimates. Finally, we discuss how interferometry and high-contrast imaging may be used to characterize other candidate star+compact object binaries, including those that will be discovered with Gaia DR4, as part of a larger effort to uncover the hidden population of black holes in the Milky Way.         |

|| Q. Wang, et al. -- incl., <mark>Y. Wang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-12-03*|

|**Abstract**|            To investigate the impact of nuclear reaction rate uncertainties on type I X-ray burst nucleosynthesis, comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations are performed with temperature-independent and -dependent variations in reaction rates using the REACLIB and STARLIB libraries, respectively. A total of 1,711 $(p, \gamma)$, $(p, \alpha)$, $(\alpha, p)$, and $(\alpha, \gamma)$ reactions are varied simultaneously, along with their inverse reactions, via detailed balance. For the first time, it is found that Monte Carlo sampling with larger perturbations to these reaction rates may lead to multi-peaked abundance distributions for some isotopes. These multi-peak structures arise not only from coupled reactions but also, in some cases, from single reactions. Our study also confirmed previously identified key reactions and provides more robust lists. These reactions deserve priority consideration in future study.         |
