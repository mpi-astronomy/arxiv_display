|**Abstract**| The earliest stages of star formation, when young stars are still deeply embedded in their natal clouds, represent a critical phase in the matter cycle between gas clouds and young stellar regions. Until now, the high-resolution infrared observations required for characterizing this heavily obscured phase (during which massive stars have formed, but optical emission is not detected) could only be obtained for a handful of the most nearby galaxies. One of the main hurdles has been the limited angular resolution of the Spitzer Space Telescope. With the revolutionary capabilities of the JWST, it is now possible to investigate the matter cycle during the earliest phases of star formation as a function of the galactic environment. In this Letter, we demonstrate this by measuring the duration of the embedded phase of star formation and the implied time over which molecular clouds remain inert in the galaxy NGC628 at a distance of 9.8Mpc, demonstrating that the cosmic volume where this measurement can be made has increased by a factor of $>100$ compared to Spitzer. We show that young massive stars remain embedded for $5.1_{-1.4}^{+2.7}$Myr ($2.3_{-1.4}^{+2.7}$Myr of which being heavily obscured), representing $\sim20\%$ of the total cloud lifetime. These values are in broad agreement with previous measurements in five nearby ($D < 3.5$Mpc) galaxies and constitute a proof of concept for the systematic characterization of the early phase of star formation across the nearby galaxy population with the PHANGS-JWST survey. |

|**Abstract**| Intervening metal absorption lines in the spectra of z > 6 quasars are fundamental probes of the ionization state and chemical composition of circumgalactic and intergalactic gas near the end of the reionization epoch. Large absorber samples are required to robustly measure typical absorber properties and to refine models of the synthesis, transport, and ionization of metals in the early Universe. The "Ultimate XSHOOTER legacy survey of quasars at z~5.8-6.6" (XQR-30) has obtained high signal-to-noise spectra of 30 luminous quasars, nearly quadrupling the existing sample of 12 high quality z~6 quasar spectra. We use this unprecedented sample to construct a catalog of 778 systems showing absorption in one or more of MgII (360 systems), FeII (184), CII (46), CIV (479), SiIV (127), and NV (13) which span 2 < z < 6.5. This catalog significantly expands on existing samples of z > 5 absorbers, especially for CIV and SiIV which are important probes of the ionizing photon background at high redshift. The sample is 50% (90%) complete for rest-frame equivalent widths W > 0.03AA (0.09AA). We publicly release the absorber catalog along with completeness statistics and a Python script to compute the absorption search path for different ions and redshift ranges. This dataset is a key legacy resource for studies of enriched gas from the era of galaxy assembly to cosmic noon, and paves the way for even higher redshift studies with the James Webb Space Telescope and 30m-class telescopes. |

|**Abstract**| We present here the first ever mid-infrared spectroscopic time series observation of the transiting exoplanet \object{L 168-9 b} with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope. The data were obtained as part of the MIRI commissioning activities, to characterize the performance of the Low Resolution Spectroscopy (LRS) mode for these challenging observations. To assess the MIRI LRS performance, we performed two independent analyses of the data. We find that with a single transit observation we reached a spectro-photometric precision of $\sim$50 ppm in the 7-8~\micron~range at R=50, consistent with $\sim$25 ppm systematic noise. The derived band averaged transit depth is 524~$\pm$~15~ppm and 547~$\pm$~13~ppm for the two applied analysis methods, respectively, recovering the known transit depth to within 1~$\sigma$. The measured noise in the planet's transmission spectrum is approximately 15-20\% higher than random noise simulations over wavelengths $6.8 \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 11$ $\mu$m. We observed an excess noise at shorter wavelengths, for which possible causes are discussed. This performance was achieved with limited in-flight calibration data, demonstrating the future potential of MIRI for the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. |

|**Abstract**| The Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescope system is located on the Canary Island of La Palma and inspects the very high-energy (VHE, few tens of GeV and above) gamma-ray sky. MAGIC consists of two imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), which capture images of the air showers originating from the absorption of gamma rays and cosmic rays by the atmosphere, through the detection of Cherenkov photons emitted in the shower. The sensitivity of IACTs to gamma-ray sources is mainly determined by the ability to reconstruct the properties (type, energy, and arrival direction) of the primary particle generating the air shower. The state-of-the-art IACT pipeline for shower reconstruction is based on the parameterization of the shower images by extracting geometric and stereoscopic features and machine learning algorithms like random forest or boosted decision trees. In this contribution, we explore deep convolutional neural networks applied directly to the pixelized images of the camera as a promising method for IACT full-event reconstruction and present the performance of the method on observational data using CTLearn, a package for IACT event reconstruction that exploits deep learning. |

|**Abstract**| High-contrast imaging has afforded astronomers the opportunity to study light directly emitted by adolescent (tens of Myr) and ``proto" ($<$10Myr) planets still undergoing formation. Direct detection of these planets is enabled by empirical Point Spread Function (PSF) modeling and removal algorithms. The computational intensity of such algorithms, and their multiplicity of tunable input parameters, has led to the prevalence of ad-hoc optimization approaches to high-contrast imaging results. In this work, we present a new, systematic approach to optimization vetted using data of the high-contrast stellar companion HD 142527 B from the Magellan Adaptive Optics (MagAO) Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey (GAPlanetS). More specifically, we present a grid search technique designed to explore three influential parameters of the PSF-subtraction algorithm pyKLIP -- annuli, movement, and KL modes. We consider multiple metrics for post-processed image quality in order to optimally recover at H$\alpha$ (656nm) synthetic planets injected into contemporaneous continuum (643nm) images. These metrics include: peak (single-pixel) SNR, average (multi-pixel average) SNR, 5$\sigma$ contrast, and false-positive fraction. We apply continuum-optimized KLIP reduction parameters to six H$\alpha$ direct detections of the low-mass stellar companion HD142527 B, and recover the companion at a range of separations. Relative to a single-informed, non-optimized set of KLIP parameters applied to all datasets uniformly, our multi-metric grid search optimization led to improvements in companion SNR of up to 1.2$\sigma$, with an average improvement of 0.6$\sigma$. Since many direct imaging detections lie close to the canonical 5$\sigma$ threshold, even such modest improvements may result in higher yields in future imaging surveys. |

|**Abstract**| We analyze a sample of 45 Type II supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public survey using a grid of hydrodynamical models in order to assess whether theoretically-driven forecasts can intelligently guide follow up observations supporting all-sky survey alert streams. We estimate several progenitor properties and explosion physics parameters including zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS) mass, mass-loss rate, kinetic energy, 56Ni mass synthesized, host extinction, and the time of explosion. Using complete light curves we obtain confident characterizations for 34 events in our sample, with the inferences of the remaining 11 events limited either by poorly constraining data or the boundaries of our model grid. We also simulate real-time characterization of alert stream data by comparing our model grid to various stages of incomplete light curves (t less than 25 days, t less than 50 days, all data), and find that some parameters are more reliable indicators of true values at early epochs than others. Specifically, ZAMS mass, time of explosion, steepness parameter beta, and host extinction are reasonably constrained with incomplete light curve data, whereas mass-loss rate, kinetic energy and 56Ni mass estimates generally require complete light curves spanning greater than 100 days. We conclude that real-time modeling of transients, supported by multi-band synthetic light curves tailored to survey passbands, can be used as a powerful tool to identify critical epochs of follow up observations. Our findings are relevant to identify, prioritize, and coordinate efficient follow up of transients discovered by Vera C. Rubin Observatory. |

|| <mark>Ancla Müller</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2022-11-30*|

|**Abstract**| AT 2000ch is a highly variable massive star and supernova imposter in NGC 3432 first detected in 2000. It is similar and often compared to SN 2009ip, and it is therefore expected to undergo a core-collapse supernova -- a SN imposter of similar brightness -- in the near future. We characterize the long-term variability of AT 2000ch in the radio and optical regimes with archival data reaching back to the year 1984. We use these newly reduced observations in addition to observations in the literature to restrict the mass-loss rates of AT 2000ch at multiple epochs based on different approaches, and to infer the general properties of its circumstellar nebula with respect to the detected radio brightness. We extend the known optical light curve of AT 2000ch up to the beginning of 2022 by performing point spread function photometry on archival data from the Palomar Transient Factory and the Zwicky Transient Facility. We reduced archival radio continuum observations obtained with the Very Large Array using standard calibration and imaging methods and complemented these with pre-reduced \changes observations as well as observations obtained with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and LOw Frequency ARray. For the analysis of AT 2000ch, we consider the optical light curve and color evolution, its radio continuum brightness at different frequencies and times, and the corresponding spectral indices. We estimated mass-loss rates and optical depths based on radio continuum brightnesses and Ha fluxes. We report two newly detected outbursts of AT 2000ch similar to those found in the 2000s and 13 re-brightening events, of which at least four are not conclusively detected because of insufficient sampling of the light curve. The dates of all outbursts and significant, well-sampled re-brightening events are consistent with a period of $\sim 201 \pm 12\,$days over a total time-span of two decades. Such a behavior has never been found for any SN imposter, especially not for candidate SN~2009ip analogs. During 2010 to 2012 and 2014 to 2018, we only have a few detections, which is insufficient to come to any conclusion as to a possible less eruptive phase of the transient. We find steady dimming after the most recent re-brightening events and possible evidence of porosity in the circumstellar envelope, suggesting AT~2000ch may currently be in transition to a state of relative calm. We identified a second, unrelated source at a projected distance of $\sim 23\,$pc ($\sim0.5^{\prime\prime}$) that has contaminated the optical measurements of AT~2000ch at its minimum luminosity over the last two decades probably on a $5\%-10\,\%$ level, but this does not affect our overall findings and is negligible during re-brightening. We are able to restrict the mass-loss rate of AT~2000ch to range between several $10^{-6}\,\textrm{M}_{\odot}/\textrm{yr}$ and several $10^{-5}\,\textrm{M}_{\odot}/\textrm{yr}$. The fresh ejecta appear to be optically thick to radio continuum emission at least within the first $\sim 25\,$days after significant re-brightening. |

|**Abstract**| We present the first high spectral resolution mid-infrared survey in the Orion BN/KL region, covering 7.2 to 28.3 micron. With SOFIA/EXES we target the enigmatic source Orion IRc2. While this is in the most prolifically studied massive star-forming region, longer wavelengths and molecular emission lines dominated previous spectral surveys. The mid-infrared observations in this work access different components and molecular species in unprecedented detail. We unambiguously identify two new kinematic components, both chemically rich with multiple molecular absorption lines. The "blue clump" has vLSR = -7.1 \pm 0.7 km/s and the "red clump" 1.4 \pm 0.5 km/s. While the blue and red clumps have similar temperatures and line widths, molecular species in the blue clump have higher column densities. They are both likely linked to pure rotational H2 emission also covered by this survey. This work provides evidence for the scenario that the blue and red clumps are distinct components unrelated to the classic components in the Orion BN/KL region. Comparison to spectroscopic surveys towards other infrared targets in the region show that the blue clump is clearly extended. We analyze, compare, and present in depth findings on the physical conditions of C2H2, 13CCH2, CH4, CS, H2O, HCN, H13CN, HNC, NH3, and SO2 absorption lines and an H2 emission line associated with the blue and red clumps. We also provide limited analysis of H2O and SiO molecular emission lines towards Orion IRc2 and the atomic forbidden transitions [FeII], [SI], [SIII], and [NeII]. |

|| Igor Andreoni, et al. -- incl., <mark>Lin Yan</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2022-11-30*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in ApJL*|
|**Abstract**| Some Hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae are likely powered by a magnetar central engine, making their luminosity larger than common supernovae. Although a significant amount of X-ray flux is expected from the spin down of the magnetar, direct observational evidence is still to be found, giving rise to the "missing energy" problem. Here we present NuSTAR observations of nearby SN 2018hti 2.4y (rest frame) after its optical peak. We expect that, by this time, the ejecta have become optically thin for photons more energetic than about 15keV. No flux is detected at the position of the supernova down to $F_{\rm{10-30keV}} = 9.0\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, or an upper limit of $7.9 \times 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at a distance of 271Mpc. This constrains the fraction of bolometric luminosity from the putative spinning down magnetar to be $f_{\rm X} \lesssim 36$% in the 10-30keV range in a conservative case, $f_{\rm X} \lesssim 11$% in an optimistic case. |

|**Abstract**| Spectroscopic observations of stars in young open clusters have revealed evidence for a dichotomous distribution of stellar rotational velocities, with 10-30% of stars rotating slowly and the remaining 70-90% rotating fairly rapidly. At the same time, high-precision multiband photometry of young star clusters shows a split main sequence band, which is again interpreted as due to a spin dichotomy. Recent papers suggest that extreme rotation is required to retrieve the photometric split. Our new grids of MESA models and the prevalent SYCLIST models show, however, that initial slow (0-35% of the linear Keplerian rotation velocities) and intermediate (50-65% of the Keplerian rotation velocities) rotation are adequate to explain the photometric split. These values are consistent with the recent spectroscopic measurements of cluster and field stars, and are likely to reflect the birth spin distributions of upper main-sequence stars. A fraction of the initially faster-rotating stars may be able to reach near-critical rotation at the end of their main-sequence evolution and produce Be stars in the turn-off region of young star clusters. However, we find that the presence of Be stars up to two magnitudes below the cluster turnoff advocates for a crucial role of binary interaction in creating Be stars. We argue that surface chemical composition measurements may help distinguish these two Be star formation channels. While only the most rapidly rotating, and therefore nitrogen-enriched, single stars can evolve into Be stars, slow pre-mass-transfer rotation and inefficient accretion allows for mild or no enrichment even in critically rotating accretion-induced Be stars. Our results shed new light on the origin of the spin distribution of young and evolved B-type main sequence stars. |

|**Abstract**| We propose a semi-analytic model that is developed to understand the cosmological evolution of the mean metallicity in the Universe. In particular, we study the contributions of Population III (Pop III) and Population II (Pop II) stars to the production of $\mathrm{Fe,~Si,~Zn, ~Ni,~P, ~Mg, ~Al, ~S, ~C, ~N}$, and $\mathrm{~O}$. We aim to quantify the roles of two different models in the chemical enrichment of the Universe. The first model (A) considers both stars with Pop III and Pop II yields. For the second model (B), the yields involved are only for Pop II stars. We start by describing the cosmic star formation rate (CSFR) through an adaptation of a scenario developed within the hierarchical scenario of structure formation with a Press-Schechter-like formalism. We adapt the formalism to implement the CSFR to the standard chemical evolution scenario to investigate the course of chemical evolution on a cosmological basis. Calculations start at redshift $z\sim 20$, and we compare the results of our two models with data from damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems (DLAs), and globular clusters (GCs). Our main results find that metal production in the Universe occurred very early, quickly increasing with the formation of the first stars. When comparing results for [Fe/H] with observations from GCs, yields of Pop II stars are not enough to explain the observed chemical abundances, requiring stars with physical properties similar those expected from Pop III stars. Our semi-analytic model can deliver consistent results for the evolution of cosmic metallicities. Our results show that the chemical enrichment in the early Universe is rapid, and at redshift $\sim 12.5$, the metallicity reaches $10^{-4}\, Z_{\odot}$ for the model that includes Pop III stars. In addition, we explore values for the initial mass function (IMF) within the range $[0.85, 1.85]$. |

|**Abstract**| Using various latest cosmological datasets including Type-Ia supernovae, cosmic microwave background radiation, baryon acoustic oscillations, and estimations of the Hubble parameter, we test some dark energy models with parameterized equations of state and try to distinguish or select observation-preferred models. We obtain the best fitting results of the six models and calculate their values of the Akaike Information Criteria and Bayes Information Criterion. And we can distinguish these dark energy models from each other by using these two information criterions. However, the $\Lambda $CDM model remains the best fit model. Furthermore, we perform geometric diagnostics including statefinder and Om diagnostics to understand the geometric behaviour of the dark energy models. We find that the six DE models can be distinguished from each other and from $\Lambda$CDM, Chaplygin gas, quintessence models after the statefinder and Om diagnostics were performed. Finally, we consider the growth factor of the dark energy models with comparison to $\Lambda $CDM model. Still, we find the models can be distinguished from each other and from $\Lambda $CDM model through the growth factor approximation. |

|**Abstract**| It is well established that solar eruptions are powered by free magnetic energy stored in current-carrying magnetic field in the corona. It has also been generally accepted that magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) are a critical component of many coronal mass ejections (CMEs). What remains controversial is whether MFRs are present well before the eruption. Our aim is to identify progenitors of MFRs, and investigate pre-eruptive magnetic properties associated with these progenitors. Here we analyze 28 MFRs erupting within 45 deg from the disk center from 2010 to 2015. All MFRs'feet are well identified by conjugate coronal dimmings. We then calculate magnetic properties at the feet of the MFRs, prior to their eruptions, using Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) vector magnetograms. Our results show that only 8 erupting MFRs are associated with significant non-neutralized electric currents, 4 of which also exhibit pre-eruptive dimmings at the foot-prints. Twist and current distributions are asymmetric at the two feet of these MFRs. The presence of pre-eruption dimmings associated with non-neutralized currents suggests the pre-existing MFRs. Furthermore, evolution of conjugate dimmings and electric currents within the foot-prints can provide clues about the internal structure of MFRs and their formation mechanism. |

|**Abstract**| In this paper, we perform a comprehensive study for the physical properties of SN 2018gk which is a luminous type IIb supernova (SN). We find that the early-time photospheric velocity vary from a larger value to a smaller value before the photosphere reach a temperature floor. We generalize the photosphere modulus and fit the multiband light curves (LCs) of SN 2018gk. We find that the $^{56}$Ni mass model require $\sim$1.1 M$_\odot$ of $^{56}$Ni which is larger than the derived ejecta mass ($\sim$0.58 M$_\odot$) as well as the derived $^{56}$Ni mass ($\sim$0.4 M$_\odot$) in the literature. Alternatively, we use the magnetar plus $^{56}$Ni and the fallback plus $^{56}$Ni models to fit the LCs of SN 2018gk, finding that the two models can can fit the LCs. We favor the magnetar plus $^{56}$Ni since the parameters are well constrained and rather reasonable ($M_{\rm ej} =$ 2.80 M$_\odot$, $M_{\rm Ni}=0.16 $ M$_\odot$ which is smaller than the upper limit of the value of the $^{56}$Ni mass can by synthesized by the neutrino-powered core collapse SNe, $B=8.47\times10^{14}$ G which is comparable to those of luminous and superluminous SNe studied in the literature, and $P_0=$ 10.83 ms which is comparable to those of luminous SNe). Therefore, we suggest that SN 2018gk might be a SNe IIb mainly powered by a central engine. Finally, we confirm the NIR excesses of the SEDs of SN 2018gk at some epochs and constrain the physical properties of the putative dust using the blackbody plus dust emission model. |

|**Abstract**| The star formation rate in galaxies is well known to correlate with stellar mass (the `star-forming main sequence'). Here we extend this further to explore any additional dependence on galaxy surface brightness, a proxy for stellar mass surface density. We use a large sample of low redshift ($z \leq 0.08$) galaxies from the GAMA survey which have both SED derived star formation rates and photometric bulge-disc decompositions, the latter providing measures of disc surface brightness and disc masses. Using two samples, one of galaxies fitted by a single component with S\'{e}rsic index below 2 and one of the discs from two-component fits, we find that once the overall mass dependence of star formation rate is accounted for, there is no evidence in either sample for a further dependence on stellar surface density. |

|**Abstract**| It has been suggested that the occurrence rate of hot Jupiters (HJs) in open clusters might reach several per cent, significantly higher than that of the field ($\sim$ a per cent). In a stellar cluster, when a planetary system scatters with a stellar binary, it may acquire a companion star which may excite large amplitude von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations in the planet's orbital eccentricity, triggering high-eccentricity migration and the formation of an HJ. We quantify the efficiency of this mechanism by modelling the evolution of a gas giant around a solar mass star under the influence of successive scatterings with binary and single stars. We show that the chance that a planet $\in(1,10)$ au becomes an HJ in a Gyr in a cluster of stellar density $n_*=50$ pc$^{-3}$ and binary fraction $f_\mathrm{bin}=0.5$ is about 2\% and an additional 4\% are forced by the companion star into collision with or tidal disruption by the central host. An empirical fit shows that the total percentage of those outcomes asymptotically reaches an upper limit determined solely by $f_\mathrm{bin}$ (e.g., $10\%$ at $f_\mathrm{bin}=0.3$ and 18\% at $f_\mathrm{bin}=1$) on a timescale inversely proportional to $n_*$ ($\sim$ Gyr for $n_*\sim100$ pc$^{-3}$). The ratio of collisions to tidal disruptions is roughly a few, and depends on the tidal model. Therefore, if the giant planet occurrence rate is 10~\%, our mechanism implies an HJ occurrence rate of a few times 0.1~\% in a Gyr and can thus explain a substantial fraction of the observed rate. |

|*Appeared on*| *2022-11-30*|

|**Abstract**| This paper represents an effort to provide robust constraints on cosmology and the galaxy-halo connection using a fully numerical model of small-scale galaxy clustering. We explore two extensions to the standard Halo Occupation Distribution model: assembly bias, whereby halo occupation depends on both halo mass and the larger environment, and velocity bias, whereby galaxy velocities do not perfectly trace the velocity of the dark matter within the halo. Moreover, we incorporate halo mass corrections to account for the impact of baryonic physics on the halo population. We identify an optimal set of clustering measurements to constrain this "decorated" HOD model for both low- and high-luminosity galaxies in SDSS DR7. We find that, for low-luminosity galaxies, a model with both assembly bias and velocity bias provides the best fit to the clustering measurements, with no tension remaining in the fit. In this model we find evidence for both central and satellite galaxy assembly bias at the 99% and 95% confidence levels, respectively. In addition, we find evidence for satellite galaxy velocity bias at the 99.9% confidence level. For high luminosity galaxies, we find no evidence for either assembly bias or velocity bias, but our model exhibits significant tension with SDSS measurements. We find that all of these conclusions still stand when we include the effects of baryonic physics on the halo mass function, suggesting that the tension we find for high luminosity galaxies may be due to a problem with our assumed cosmological model. |

|*Comments*| *34 page, 9 figures*|
|**Abstract**| Interstellar and cometary ices play an important role in the formation of planetary systems around young stars. Their main constituent is amorphous solid water (ASW). Although ASW is widely studied, vibrational energy dissipation and structural changes due to vibrational excitation are less well understood. The hydrogen-bonding network is likely a crucial component in this. Here we present experimental results on hydrogen-bonding changes in ASW induced by the intense, nearly monochromatic mid-IR free-electron laser (FEL) radiation of the FELIX-2 beamline at the HFML-FELIX facility at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Structural changes in ASW are monitored by reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy and depend on the irradiation history of the ice. The experiments show that FEL irradiation can induce changes in the local neighborhood of the excited molecules due to energy transfer. Molecular Dynamics simulations confirm this picture: vibrationally excited molecules can reorient for a more optimal tetrahedral surrounding without breaking existing hydrogen bonds. The vibrational energy can transfer through the hydrogen-bonding network to water molecules that have the same vibrational frequency. We hence expect a reduced energy dissipation in amorphous material with respect to crystalline material due to the inhomogeneity in vibrational frequencies as well as the presence of specific hydrogen-bonding defect sites which can also hamper the energy transfer. |

|**Abstract**| We present the first rest-frame optical spectrum of a high-redshift quasar observed with JWST/NIRCam in Wide Field Slitless (WFSS) mode. The observed quasar, J0100+2802, is the most luminous quasar known at $z>6$. We measure the mass of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) by means of the rest-frame optical H$\beta$ emission line, and find consistent mass measurements of the quasar's SMBH of $M_\bullet\approx10^{10}\,M_\odot$ when compared to the estimates based on the properties of rest-frame UV emission lines CIV and MgII, which are accessible from ground-based observatories. To this end, we also present a newly reduced rest-frame UV spectrum of the quasar observed with X-Shooter/VLT and FIRE/Magellan for a total of 16.8 hours. We readdress the question whether this ultra-luminous quasar could be effected by strong gravitational lensing making use of the diffraction limited NIRCam images in three different wide band filters (F115W, F200W, F356W), which improves the achieved spatial resolution compared to previous images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope by a factor of two. We do not find any evidence for a foreground deflecting galaxy, nor for multiple images of the quasar, and determine the probability for magnification due to strong gravitational lensing with image separations below the diffraction limit of $\Delta\theta\lesssim 0.05''$ to be $\lesssim 2.2\times 10^{-3}$. Our observations therefore confirm that this quasar hosts a ten billion solar mass black hole less than $1$ Gyr after the Big Bang, which is challenging to explain with current black hole formation models. |

|*Appeared on*| *2022-11-30*|
|*Comments*| *27 pages, 7 figures*|
|**Abstract**| The bulge of M31 is of interest in the context of the nature of galactic bulges and how their structure relates to bulge formation mechanisms and their subsequent evolution. With the UVIT instrument on AstroSat, we have observed the bulge of M31 in five far ultraviolet (FUV) and near ultraviolet (NUV) filters at 1" spatial resolution. Models for the luminosity distribution of the bulge are constructed using the UVIT data and the galaxy image-fitting algorithm GALFIT. We fit the bulge without nuclear region with a Sersic function the five images and find Sersic indices ($\simeq2.1$ to 2.5) similar to previous studies but smaller $R_e$ values ($\simeq0.5$ to 0.6 kpc). When the images include the nuclear region, a multicomponent model is used to find the best-fit. We use an 8-component fit for the FUV 148nm image, which has the highest sensitivity. The other images (169 to 279 nm) are fit with 4-component models. The dust lanes in the bulge region are recovered in the residual image after subtraction of the bright bulge light using the multicomponent model. The dust lanes show that M31's nuclear spiral is visible in absorption at NUV and FUV wavelengths. The bulge images show boxy contours in all five UVIT wavebands, which is confirmed by fitting using GALFIT. The Sersic indices of $\sim$2.1-2.5 are intermediate between expected values for a classical bulge and for a pseudobulge. The boxiness of the bulge provides further evidence that M31's bulge has contributions from a classical bulge and a pseudobulge. |

|**Abstract**| The shape and orientation of dark matter (DM) halos are sensitive to the micro-physics of the DM particle, yet in many mass models, the symmetry axes of the Milky Way's DM halo are often assumed to be aligned with the symmetry axes of the stellar disk. This is well-motivated for the inner DM halo but not for the outer halo. We use zoomed cosmological-baryonic simulations from the Latte suite of FIRE-2 Milky Way-mass galaxies to explore the evolution of the DM halo's orientation with radius and time, with or without a major merger with a Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) analog, and when varying the DM model. In three of the four CDM halos we examine, the orientation of the halo minor axis diverges from the stellar disk vector by more than 20 degrees beyond about 30 galactocentric kpc, reaching a maximum of 30--90 degrees depending on the individual halo's formation history. In identical simulations using a model of self-interacting DM with $\sigma = 1 \, \mathrm{cm}^2 \, \mathrm{g}^{-1}$, the halo remains aligned with the stellar disk out to $\sim$200--400 kpc. Interactions with massive satellites ($M \gtrsim 4 \times 10^{10} \, \rm{M_\odot}$ at pericenter; $M \gtrsim 3.3 \times 10^{10} \, \rm{M_\odot}$ at infall) affect the orientation of the halo significantly, aligning the halo's major axis with the satellite galaxy from the disk to the virial radius. The relative orientation of the halo and disk beyond 30 kpc is a potential diagnostic of SIDM if the effects of massive satellites can be accounted for. |

|**Abstract**| The Earth's turbulent atmosphere results in speckled and blurred images of astronomical objects when observed by ground based visible and near-infrared telescopes. Adaptive optics (AO) systems are employed to reduce these atmospheric effects by using wavefront sensors (WFS) and deformable mirrors. Some AO systems are not fast enough to correct for strong, fast, high turbulence wind layers leading to the wind butterfly effect, or wind-driven halo, reducing contrast capabilities in coronagraphic images. Estimating the effective wind speed of the atmosphere allows us to calculate the atmospheric coherence time. This is not only an important parameter to understand for site characterization but could be used to help remove the wind butterfly in post processing. Here we present a method for estimating the atmospheric effective wind speed from spatio-temporal covariance maps generated from pseudo open-loop (POL) WFS data. POL WFS data is used as it aims to reconstruct the full wavefront information when operating in closed-loop. The covariance maps show how different atmospheric turbulent layers traverse the telescope. Our method successfully recovered the effective wind speed from simulated WFS data generated with the soapy python library. The simulated atmospheric turbulence profiles consist of two turbulent layers of ranging strengths and velocities. The method has also been applied to Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) AO WFS data. This gives insight into how the effective wind speed can affect the wind-driven halo seen in the AO image point spread function. In this paper, we will present results from simulated and GPI WFS data. |

|**Abstract**| Context. The present study addresses a key question for our understanding of the relation between void galaxies and their environment: the relationship between luminous and dark matter in and around voids. Aims. To explore how empty of matter local Universe voids are, we study the full (dark+luminous) matter content of seven nearby cosmic voids that are fully contained within the CosmicFlows-3 volume. Methods. The cosmic voids matter density profiles are independently obtained using two different methods. They are built on one hand from the galaxy redshift space 2 points-correlation function and, on the other hand, using peculiar velocity gradients from the CosmicFlows-3 dataset. Results. The results are noticeable since when using the redshift survey, all voids show a radial positive gradient of galaxies, while based on the dynamical analysis, only three of these voids display a clear underdensity of matter in their center. Conclusions. It is the first time such a detailed observational analysis of voids is conducted, showing that void emptiness should be derived from dynamical information. Yet, from this limited study, the Hercules void is the best candidate for a local Universe pure "pristine volume" expanding in 3 directions with no dark matter located in that void. |

|*Appeared on*| *2022-11-30*|

|**Abstract**| Several planetary systems are known to host multiple giant planets. However, when two giant planets are accreting from the same disk, it is unclear what effect the presence of the second planet has on the gas accretion process of both planets. In this paper we perform long-term 2D isothermal hydrodynamical simulations (over more than 0.5 Myrs) with the FARGO-2D1D code, considering two non-migrating planets accreting from the same gaseous disk. We find that the evolution of the planets' mass ratio depends on gap formation. However, in all cases, when the planets start accreting at the same time, they end up with very similar masses (0.9 $<m_{p,out}/m_{p,in}<$ 1.1 after 0.5 Myrs). Delaying the onset of accretion of one planet allows the planets' mass ratio to reach larger values initially, but they quickly converge to similar masses afterward (0.8 $<m_{p,out}/m_{p,in}<$ 2 in $10^5$ yrs). In order to reproduce the more diverse observed mass ratios of exoplanets, the planets must start accreting gas at different times, and their accretion must be stopped quickly after the beginning of runaway gas accretion (less than 0.5 Myrs), for example via disk dispersal. The evolution of the planets' mass ratio can have an important impact on the dynamics of the system and may constrain the formation history of Jupiter and Saturn. |

|**Abstract**| The 3UCubed project is a 3U CubeSat being jointly developed by the University of New Hampshire, Sonoma State University, and Howard University as a part of the NASA Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe, IMAP, student collaboration. This project comprises of a multidisciplinary team of undergraduate students from all three universities. The mission goal of the 3UCubed is to understand how Earths polar upper atmosphere the thermosphere in Earths auroral regions, responds to particle precipitation and solar wind forcing, and internal magnetospheric processes. 3UCubed includes two instruments with rocket heritage to achieve the science mission: an ultraviolet photomultiplier tube, UVPMT, and an electron retarding potential analyzer ERPA. The spacecraft bus consists of the following subsystems: Attitude Determination and Control, Command and Data Handling, Power, Communication, Structural, and Thermal. Currently, the project is in the post-PDR stage, starting to build and test engineering models to develop a FlatSat prior to critical design review in 2023. The goal is to launch at least one 3U CubeSat to collect science data close to the anticipated peak of Solar Cycle 25 around July 2025. Our mother mission, IMAP, is also projected to launch in 2025, which will let us jointly analyze the science data of the main mission, providing the solar wind measurements and inputs to the magnetosphere with that of 3UCubed, providing the response of Earths cusp to these inputs. |
