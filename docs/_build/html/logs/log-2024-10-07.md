|**Abstract**|            The structure and chemistry of the dusty interstellar medium (ISM) are shaped by complex processes that depend on the local radiation field, gas composition, and dust grain properties. Of particular importance are Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), which emit strong vibrational bands in the mid-infrared, and play a key role in the ISM energy balance. We recently identified global correlations between PAH band and optical line ratios across three nearby galaxies, suggesting a connection between PAH heating and gas ionization throughout the ISM. In this work, we perform a census of the PAH heating -- gas ionization connection using $\sim$700,000 independent pixels that probe scales of 40--150 pc in nineteen nearby star-forming galaxies from the PHANGS survey. We find a universal relation between $\log$PAH(11.3 \mic/7.7 \mic) and $\log$([SII]/H$\alpha$) with a slope of $\sim$0.2 and a scatter of $\sim$0.025 dex. The only exception is a group of anomalous pixels that show unusually high (11.3 \mic/7.7 \mic) PAH ratios in regions with old stellar populations and high starlight-to-dust emission ratios. Their mid-infrared spectra resemble those of elliptical galaxies. AGN hosts show modestly steeper slopes, with a $\sim$10\% increase in PAH(11.3 \mic/7.7 \mic) in the diffuse gas on kpc scales. This universal relation implies an emerging simplicity in the complex ISM, with a sequence that is driven by a single varying property: the spectral shape of the interstellar radiation field. This suggests that other properties, such as gas-phase abundances, gas ionization parameter, and grain charge distribution, are relatively uniform in all but specific cases.         |

|**Abstract**|            With sizable volatile envelopes but smaller radii than the solar system ice giants, sub-Neptunes have been revealed as one of the most common types of planet in the galaxy. While the spectroscopic characterization of larger sub-Neptunes (2.5-4R$_\oplus$) has revealed hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, smaller sub-Neptunes (1.6--2.5R$_\oplus$) could either host thin, rapidly evaporating hydrogen-rich atmospheres or be stable metal-rich "water worlds" with high mean molecular weight atmospheres and a fundamentally different formation and evolutionary history. Here, we present the 0.6--2.8$\mu$m JWST NIRISS/SOSS transmission spectrum of GJ 9827 d, the smallest (1.98 R$_\oplus$) warm (T$_\mathrm{eq, A_B=0.3} \sim 620$K) sub-Neptune where atmospheric absorbers have been detected to date. Our two transit observations with NIRISS/SOSS, combined with the existing HST/WFC3 spectrum, enable us to break the clouds-metallicity degeneracy. We detect water in a highly metal-enriched "steam world" atmosphere (O/H of $\sim 4$ by mass and H$_2$O found to be the background gas with a volume mixing ratio of >31%). We further show that these results are robust to stellar contamination through the transit light source effect. We do not detect escaping metastable He, which, combined with previous nondetections of escaping He and H, supports the steam atmosphere scenario. In water-rich atmospheres, hydrogen loss driven by water photolysis happens predominantly in the ionized form which eludes observational constraints. We also detect several flares in the NIRISS/SOSS light-curves with far-UV energies of the order of 10$^{30}$ erg, highlighting the active nature of the star. Further atmospheric characterization of GJ 9827 d probing carbon or sulfur species could reveal the origin of its high metal enrichment.         |

|**Abstract**|            Over the past several decades, time-series photometry of CSPNe has yielded significant results including, but not limited to, discoveries of nearly 100 binary systems, insights into pulsations and winds in young white dwarfs, and studies of stars undergoing very late thermal pulses. We have undertaken a systematic study of optical photometric variability of cataloged CSPNe, using the epochal photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). By applying appropriate variability metrics, we arrive at a list of 94 significantly variable CSPNe. Based on the timescales of the light-curve activity, we classify the variables broadly into short- and long-timescale variables. In this first paper in this series, we focus on the former, which is the majority class comprising 83 objects. We infer periods for six sources for the first time, and recover several known periodic variables. Among the aperiodic sources, most exhibit a jitter around a median flux with a stable amplitude, and a few show outbursts. We draw attention to WeSb 1, which shows a different kind of variability: prominent deep and aperiodic dips, resembling transits from a dust/debris disk. We find strong evidence for a binary nature of WeSb 1 (possibly an A- to G-type companion). The compactness of the emission lines and inferred high electron densities make WeSb 1 a candidate for either an EGB 6-type planetary nucleus, or a symbiotic system inside an evolved planetary nebula, both of which are rare objects. To demonstrate further promise with ZTF, we report three additional newly identified periodic sources that do not appear in the list of highly variable sources. Finally, we also introduce a two-dimensional metric space defined by the von Neumann statistics and Pearson Skew and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying unique variables of astrophysical interest, like WeSb 1.         |
