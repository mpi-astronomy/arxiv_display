|**Abstract**| Blazars are radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) whose jets have a very small angle to our line of sight. Observationally, the radio emission are mostly compact or a compact-core with a 1-sided jet. With 2.5$^{\prime\prime}$ resolution at 3 GHz, the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) enables us to resolve the structure of some blazar candidates in the sky north of Decl. $-40$ deg. We introduce an algorithm to classify radio sources as either blazar-like or non-blazar-like based on their morphology in the VLASS images. We apply our algorithm to three existing catalogs, including one of known blazars (Roma-BzCAT) and two of blazar candidates identified by WISE colors and radio emission (WIBRaLS, KDEBLLACS). We show that in all three catalogs, there are objects with morphology inconsistent with being blazars. Considering all the catalogs, more than 12% of the candidates are unlikely to be blazars, based on this analysis. Notably, we show that 3% of the Roma-BzCAT "confirmed" blazars could be a misclassification based on their VLASS morphology. The resulting table with all sources and their radio morphological classification is available online. |

|**Abstract**| We report a $\sim5.2\sigma$ detection of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect in Fourier space, by combining the DESI galaxy groups and the Planck data. We use the density-weighted pairwise kSZ power spectrum as the summary statistic, and the detailed procedure of its measurement is presented in this paper. Meanwhile, we analyze the redshift space group density power spectrum to constrain its bias parameters and photo-z uncertainties. These best fitted parameters are substituted to a non-linear kSZ model, and we fit the measured kSZ power spectrum with this model to constrain the group optical depth $\bar{\tau}$. Selected by a varying lower mass threshold $M_{\rm th}$, the galaxy group catalogs with different median masses ($\tilde{M}$) are constructed from the DR9 data of the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. $\tilde{M}$ spans a wide range of $\sim10^{13}-10^{14}{\rm M}_\odot/h$ and the heaviest $\tilde{M}\sim10^{14} {\rm M}_\odot/h$ is larger than those of most other kSZ detections. When the aperture photometric filter radius $\theta_{\rm AP}$ is set to be $4.2$ arcmin, the $\tilde{M}=1.75\times10^{13}{\rm M}_\odot/h$ group sample at the median redshift $\tilde{z}=0.64$ has the highest kSZ detection ${\rm S/N}=5.2$. By fitting $\bar{\tau}$s from various samples against their $\tilde{M}$s, we obtain a linear $\log\bar{\tau}-\log \tilde{M}$ relation: $\log\bar{\tau} = \gamma(\log \tilde{M}-14)+\log\beta$, in which $\gamma=0.55\pm0.1$. We also vary the aperture photometric filter radius and measure the $\bar{\tau}$ profiles of group samples, whose constraints on the baryon distribution within and around dark matter halos will be discussed in a companion paper. |

|**Abstract**| The JCMT Transient Survey has been monitoring eight Gould Belt low-mass star-forming regions since December 2015 and six somewhat more distant intermediate-mass star-forming regions since February 2020 with SCUBA-2 on the JCMT at \ShortS and \LongS and with an approximately monthly cadence. We introduce our Pipeline v2 relative calibration procedures for image alignment and flux calibration across epochs, improving on our previous Pipeline v1 by decreasing measurement uncertainties and providing additional robustness. These new techniques work at both \LongS and \ShortNS, where v1 only allowed investigation of the \LongS data. Pipeline v2 achieves better than $0.5^{\prime\prime}$ relative image alignment, less than a tenth of the submillimeter beam widths. The v2 relative flux calibration is found to be 1\% at \LongS and $<5$\% at \ShortNS. The improvement in the calibration is demonstrated by comparing the two pipelines over the first four years of the survey and recovering additional robust variables with v2. Using the full six years of the Gould Belt survey the number of robust variables increases by 50\,\%, and at \ShortS we identify four robust variables, all of which are also robust at \LongNS. The multi-wavelength light curves for these sources are investigated and found to be consistent with the variability being due to dust heating within the envelope in response to accretion luminosity changes from the central source. |

|| <mark>S. Pfalzner</mark>, F. Dincer |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-01-09*|
|*Comments*| *14 pages, 5 figures, accepted by ApJ*|
|**Abstract**| While most protoplanetary discs lose their gas within less than 10 Myr, individual disc lifetimes vary from < 1 Myr to >> 20 Myr, with some discs existing for > 40 Myr. Mean disc half lifetimes hide this diversity; only a so-far non-existing disc lifetime distribution could capture this fact. The benefit of a disc lifetime distribution would be twofold. First, it provides a stringent test on disc evolution theories. Second, it can function as input for planet formation models. Here, we derive such a disc lifetime distribution. We heuristically test different standard distribution forms for their ability to account for the observed disc fractions at certain ages. Here, we concentrate on the distribution for low-mass stars (spectral type M3.7 - M6, $M_s \approx $ 0.1 - 0.24 M$_{sun}$) because disc lifetimes depend on stellar mass. A Weibull-type distribution ($k$=1.78, $\lambda$=9.15) describes the observational data if all stars have a disc at a cluster age $t_c$=0. However, a better match exists for lower initial disc fractions. For f(t=0)= 0.65, a Weibull distribution (k=2.34, $\lambda$=11.22) and a Gauss distribution ($\sigma$=9.52, $\mu$=9.52) fit similarly well the data. All distributions have in common that they are wide, and most discs are dissipated at ages > 5 Myr. The next challenge is to quantitatively link the diversity of disc lifetimes to the diversity in planets. |

|**Abstract**| Context. Rocky planets form by the concentration of solid particles in the inner few au regions of planet-forming disks. Their chemical composition reflects the materials in the disk available in the solid phase at the time the planets were forming. Aims. We aim to constrain the structure and dust composition of the inner disk of the young star HD 144432, using an extensive set of infrared interferometric data taken by the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), combining PIONIER, GRAVITY, and MATISSE observations. Methods. We introduced a new physical disk model, TGMdust, to image the interferometric data, and to fit the disk structure and dust composition. We also performed equilibrium condensation calculations with GGchem. Results. Our best-fit model has three disk zones with ring-like structures at 0.15, 1.3, and 4.1 au. Assuming that the dark regions in the disk at ~0.9 au and at ~3 au are gaps opened by planets, we estimate the masses of the putative gap-opening planets to be around a Jupiter mass. We find evidence for an optically thin emission ($\tau<0.4$) from the inner two disk zones ($r<4$ au) at $\lambda>3\ \mu$m. Our silicate compositional fits confirm radial mineralogy gradients. To identify the dust component responsible for the infrared continuum emission, we explore two cases for the dust composition, one with a silicate+iron mixture and the other with a silicate+carbon one. We find that the iron-rich model provides a better fit to the spectral energy distribution. Conclusions. We propose that in the warm inner regions ($r<5$ au) of typical planet-forming disks, most if not all carbon is in the gas phase, while iron and iron sulfide grains are major constituents of the solid mixture along with forsterite and enstatite. Our analysis demonstrates the need for detailed studies of the dust in inner disks with new mid-infrared instruments such as MATISSE and JWST/MIRI. |
