|**Abstract**|            In this paper, we establish and calibrate mid-infrared hydrogen recombination lines observed with JWST as accretion tracers for pre-main-sequence stars that accrete from circumstellar disks. This work is part of a coordinated, multi-observatory effort that monitored the well-known binary system DQ Tau over three orbital periods, capturing its periodic accretion bursts. In this first paper, we present 9 epochs of MIRI-MRS spectra with near-simultaneous LCO photometry and VLT X-Shooter spectroscopy. This program caught exceptional accretion variability, spanning almost two orders of magnitude between the peak of the first periastron accretion burst and the following quiescent phases. The MIRI spectra show H I line luminosities that vary in step with the accretion-luminosity time series measured with LCO and X-Shooter. The tight correlation with accretion and the large line widths, which MIRI resolves for the first time, support an accretion-flow origin for mid-infrared H I transitions. Combining these three exceptional datasets, we derive accurate relations between mid-infrared line and accretion luminosities for three H I transitions (10-7, 7-6, 8-7), and improve upon a previous relation based on Spitzer spectra. These new relations equip the community with a direct measurement of the accretion luminosity from MIRI-MRS spectra. A MIRI-derived accretion luminosity is fundamental for time-domain chemistry studies, as well as for studies of accretion in embedded/distant sources that are currently inaccessible in the optical. With these new relations, we provide accretion luminosities for an archival sample of 38 MRS spectra of protoplanetary disks published to date.         |

|**Abstract**|            A subset of galaxies have dense nuclei, and when these galaxies are accreted and tidally stripped, the nuclei can masquerade as globular clusters in the halos of large galaxies. If these nuclei contain massive central black holes, some may accrete gas and become observable as active galactic nuclei. Previous studies have found that candidate stripped nuclei rarely host luminous X-ray sources, but these studies were typically restricted to both the most massive candidate nuclei and the most luminous X-ray sources. Here we use new and archival Chandra and XMM-Newton data to search for X-ray emission in a near-complete sample of massive globular clusters and candidate stripped nuclei in the nearest accessible elliptical galaxy, NGC 5128. This sample has the unique advantage that the candidate stripped nuclei are identified dynamically via elevated mass-to-light ratios. Our central result is that 5/22 ($23^{+11}_{-6}$%) of the candidate stripped nuclei have X-ray sources down to a typical limit of $L_X \sim 5 \times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$, a fraction lower than or comparable to that among massive clusters with normal mass-to-light ratios (16/41; $39^{+8}_{-7}$%). Hence we confirm and extend the result that nearly all X-ray sources in stripped nuclei are likely to be X-ray binaries rather than active galactic nuclei. If the candidate stripped nuclei have black holes of typical masses $\sim 2 \times 10^{5} M_{\odot}$ needed to explain their elevated mass-to-light ratios, then they have typical Eddington ratios of $\lesssim 2 \times 10^{-6}$. This suggests that it will be challenging to conduct an accretion census of wandering black holes around even nearby galaxies.         |

|**Abstract**|            A multitude of spectral activity indicators are routinely computed nowadays from the spectra generated as part of planet-hunting radial velocity surveys. Searching for shared periods among them can help to robustly identify astrophysical quantities of interest, such as the stellar rotation period. However, this identification can be complicated due to the fact that many different peaks occurring in the periodograms. This is especially true in the presence of aliasing and spurious signals caused by environmental influences affecting the instrument. Our goal is to test a clustering algorithm to find signals with the same periodicity, (i.e. with the stellar rotation period) in the periodograms of a large number of activity indicators. On this basis, we have looked to evaluate the correlations between activity indicators and fundamental stellar parameters. We used generalised Lomb-Scargle periodograms to find periodic signals in 24 activity indicators, spanning the VIS and NIR channels of the CARMENES spectrograph. Common periods were subsequently determined by a machine learning algorithm for density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). The clustering analysis of the signals apparent in the spectral activity indicators is a powerful tool for the detection of stellar rotation periods. It is straightforward to implement and can be easily automated, so that large data sets can be analysed. For a sample of 136 stars, we were able to recover the stellar rotation period in a total of 59 cases, including 3 with a previously unknown rotation period. In addition, we analysed spurious signals frequently occurring at the period of one year and its integer fractions, concluding that they are likely aliases of one underlying signal. Furthermore, we reproduced the results of several previous studies on the relationships between activity indicators and the stellar characteristics.         |

|| <mark>J. Li</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-04-14*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted to ApJ. Comments are welcome!*|
|**Abstract**|            The satellite populations of Milky Way--mass systems have been extensively studied, significantly advancing our understanding of galaxy formation and dark matter physics. In contrast, the satellites of lower-mass dwarf galaxies remain largely unexplored, despite hierarchical structure formation predicting that dwarf galaxies should host their own satellites. We present the first results of the ELVES-Dwarf survey, which aims to statistically characterize the satellite populations of isolated dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume ($4<D<10$~Mpc). We identify satellite candidates in integrated light using the Legacy Surveys data and are complete down to $M_g\approx -9$ mag. We then confirm the association of satellite candidates with host galaxies using surface brightness fluctuation distances measured from the Hyper Suprime-Cam data. We surveyed 8 isolated dwarf galaxies with stellar masses ranging from sub-Small Magellanic Cloud to Large Magellanic Cloud scales ($10^{7.8} < M_\star^{\rm host}<10^{9.5}\, M_\odot$) and confirmed 6 satellites with stellar masses between $10^{5.6}$ and $10^{8} \, M_\odot$. Most confirmed satellites are star-forming, contrasting with the primarily quiescent satellites observed around Milky Way--mass hosts. By comparing observed satellite abundances and stellar mass functions with theoretical predictions, we find no evidence of a "missing satellite problem" in the dwarf galaxy regime.         |

|| Y. Ma, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-04-14*|
|*Comments*| *15 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ApJL. Comments are welcome*|
|**Abstract**|            Little red dots (LRDs) are a population of red, compact objects discovered by JWST at $z>4$. At $4<z<8$, they are roughly 100 times more abundant than UV-selected quasars. However, their number density is uncertain at $z<4$ due to the small sky coverage and limited blue wavelength coverage of JWST. We present our ground-based search for LRDs at $2\lesssim z\lesssim4$, combining ultra-deep Hyper Suprime-Cam photometry and various (near-)infrared surveys within a total area of $\sim3.1\,\mathrm{deg^{2}}$. We find that for LRDs with $M_{5500}<-22.5$, their number density declines from $\sim10^{-4.5}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $z>4$ to $\sim10^{-5.3}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $2.7<z<3.7$ and $\sim10^{-5.7}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ at $1.7<z<2.7$. We also present the Magellan/FIRE spectrum of our first followed-up candidate, DEEP23-z2LRD1 at $z_\mathrm{spec}=2.26$, as a proof of concept for our sample selection. Similar to high-redshift LRDs, the spectrum of DEEP23-z2LRD1 exhibits broad H$\alpha$ emission with $\mathrm{FWHM}\approx2400\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and with nearly symmetric narrow H$\alpha$ absorption. Additionally, DEEP23-z2LRD1 has extremely narrow [OIII] lines with $\mathrm{FWHM}\approx140\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, suggesting the presence of an accreting black hole in a low-mass host galaxy. Limited by the angular resolution of ground-based surveys, we emphasize that spectroscopic follow-ups are required to characterize the contamination fraction of this sample and pin down LRD number density at $z<4$.         |

|| J.-L. Kang, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-04-14*|
|*Comments*| *13 pages, 7 figures, submitted to MNRAS. Comments are very welcome!*|
|**Abstract**|            Accretion flows in both stellar and supermassive black holes show a distinct spectral transition. This is seen directly in binaries and changing look AGN, and also in a recent sample of eROSITA X-ray selected, unobscured AGN where the stacked spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for a single black hole mass bin (log $M/M_{\odot} =8-8.5$) clearly show the UV bright disk appearing as the luminosity increases. In binaries, this transition is associated with a change in radio jet, from coupling to the X-ray hot flow with $L_R \propto L_X^{0.7}$ (Fundamental Plane relation), to collapsing when the X-ray hot flow collapses into a disc. We explore the radio behaviour across the transition in our AGN sample by stacking VLASS images. We significantly detect weak radio emission even after subtracting the contribution from star formation in the host galaxy. The residual radio emission remains relatively constant across the transition, despite the mean mass accretion rate changing by a factor 6 and UV flux changing by a factor 100. However, the X-rays change by only a factor 2, giving a constant radio to X-ray flux ratio as predicted by the 'fundamental plane'. We show that this is consistent with these AGN having the same compact radio jet coupling to the X-ray hot flow (not the disc) as in the binaries. The most significant difference is the persistence of the coronal X-rays across the spectral transition in AGN, whereas in binaries the coronal X-rays can be very weak in the disc dominated state.         |

|| P. Palud, et al. -- incl., <mark>A. Hughes</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-04-14*|

|**Abstract**|            The current generation of millimeter receivers is able to produce cubes of 800 000 pixels by 200 000 frequency channels to cover several square degrees over the 3 mm atmospheric window. Estimating the physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM) with an astrophysical model on such datasets is challenging. Common approaches tend to converge to local minima and typically poorly reconstruct regions with low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). This instrumental revolution thus calls for new scalable data analysis techniques. We present Beetroots, a Python software that performs Bayesian reconstruction of maps of physical conditions from observation maps and an astrophysical model. It relies on an accurate statistical model, exploits spatial regularization to guide estimations, and uses state-of-the-art algorithms. It also assesses the ability of the astrophysical model to explain the observations, providing feedback to improve ISM models. We demonstrate the power of Beetroots with the Meudon PDR code on synthetic data, and then apply it to estimate physical condition maps in the full Orion molecular cloud 1 (OMC-1) star forming region based on Herschel molecular line emission maps. The application to the synthetic case shows that Beetroots can currently analyse maps with up to ten thousand pixels, addressing large variations of S/N, escaping from local minima, and providing consistent uncertainty quantifications. On a laptop, the inference runtime ranges from a few minutes for 100-pixel maps to 28 hours for 8100-pixel maps. The results on the OMC-1 maps are consistent with independent estimations from the literature, and improve our understanding of the region. This work paves the way towards systematic and rigorous analyses of observations produced by current and future instruments.         |

|| T. Fu, <mark>Y. Wang</mark>, W. Hu |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-04-14*|
|*Comments*| *16 pages, 11 figures, submitted to The Astrophysical Journal Letters (ApJL)*|
|**Abstract**|            Stellar obliquities, or spin-orbit angles, prevalent in exoplanet systems, can impose important constraints on their formation and evolution histories. Recent studies suggest that primordial misalignments between protoplanetary disks and stellar spin axes may significantly contribute to these obliquities, as those frequently observed in systems hosting hot Jupiters. In this study, we demonstrate that misaligned protoplanetary disks combined with stellar oblateness drive complex dynamical evolution in planetary systems during their disk dispersal stages. Specifically, we identify bifurcated evolutionary pathways in multi-planet systems: systems with low star-disk misalignment angles ($\psi_{\star0}$) undergo smooth, adiabatic evolution, producing nearly coplanar, low-obliquity configurations; in contrast, systems with high misalignment angles typically experience an abrupt, non-adiabatic transition, leading to large-amplitude libration of mutual planetary inclinations and then triggering chaotic eccentricity excitation. This libration and eccentricity excitation process can propagate inward-outward in compact multi-planet systems, forming an excitation chain that can destabilize the entire system. The non-adiabatic transition arises from the dynamical bifurcation-induced effect, which occurs during disk dissipation when $\psi_{\star0}\gtrsim44.6^\circ$ (for one-planet systems). Our framework predicts that surviving typical compact multi-planet systems originating from misaligned disks evolve toward coplanar, low-obliquity configurations, consistent with observations of Kepler multi-planet systems. These results advance our understanding of planetary dynamics in misaligned disks and their evolutionary outcomes.         |
