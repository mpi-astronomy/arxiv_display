|**Abstract**|            We present proper motion (PM) measurements for a sample of 23 massive star clusters within the Large Magellanic Cloud using multi-epoch data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We combined archival data from the ACS/WFC and WFC3/UVIS instruments with observations from a dedicated HST programme, resulting in time baselines between 4.7 and 18.2 yr available for PM determinations. For bright well-measured stars, we achieved nominal PM precisions of 55 $\mu$as/yr down to 11 $\mu$as/yr . To demonstrate the potential and limitations of our PM data set, we analysed the cluster NGC 1850 and showcase a selection of different science applications. The precision of the PM measurements allows us to disentangle the kinematics of the various stellar populations that are present in the HST field. The cluster has a centre-of-mass motion that is different from the surrounding old field stars and also differs from the mean motion of a close-by group of very young stars. We determined the velocity dispersion of field stars to be 0.128 +/- 0.003 mas/yr (corresponding to 30.3 +/- 0.7 km/s). The velocity dispersion of the cluster inferred from the PM data set most probably overestimates the true value, suggesting that the precision of the measurements at this stage is not sufficient for a reliable analysis of the internal kinematics of extra-galactic star clusters. Finally, we exploit the PM-cleaned catalogue of likely cluster members to determine any radial segregation between fast and slowly-rotating stars, finding that the former are more centrally concentrated. With this paper, we also release the astro-photometric catalogues for each cluster.         |

|**Abstract**|            The blue compact dwarf galaxy I Zw 18 is one of the most metal-poor ($Z \sim 3% Z_{\sun}$) star-forming galaxies in the local Universe. Its evolutionary status has sparked debate within the astronomical community. We aim to investigate the stellar populations of I Zw 18 in the near-IR using JWST/NIRCam's high spatial resolution and sensitivity. Additionally, we aim to derive the galaxy's spatially resolved star formation history (SFH) over the last 1 Gyr and provide constraints for older epochs. We used DOLPHOT to measure positions and fluxes of point sources in the F115W and F200W filters' images of I Zw 18. To derive I Zw 18's SFH, we applied the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting technique SFERA 2.0, using two independent sets of stellar models. Our analysis reveals three main stellar populations: one younger than $\sim30$ Myr, mainly in the northwest star-forming (SF) region; an intermediate-age population ($\sim 100 - 800$ Myr) in the southeast SF region; and a red and faint population linked to the underlying halo, older than 1 Gyr and possibly as old as 13.8 Gyr. The main body of the galaxy shows a very low star formation rate (SFR) of $\sim 10^{-4} M_{\odot} \text{yr}^{-1}$ between 1 and 13.8 Gyr ago. In the last billion years, I Zw 18 shows increasing SF, with strong bursts around $\sim10$ and $\sim100$ Myr ago. Component C mirrors the main body's evolution but with lower SFRs. Our findings confirm that I Zw 18 contains stars of all ages, indicating it is not a young galaxy but has an old stellar halo, similar to other BCDs. The low SF activity over the past billion years supports the "slow cooking" dwarf scenario, explaining its low metal content. Currently, the galaxy is undergoing its strongest SF episode ($\sim 0.6 M_{\odot} \text{yr}^{-1}$) mainly in the northwest region, likely due to a recent gravitational interaction with Component C.         |
