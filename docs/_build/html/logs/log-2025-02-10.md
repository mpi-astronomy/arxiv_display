|**Abstract**|            We report the masses, sizes, and orbital properties of 86 planets orbiting 55 stars observed by NASA's K2 Mission with follow-up Doppler measurements by the HIRES spectrometer at the W. M. Keck Observatory and the Automated Planet Finder at Lick Observatory. Eighty-one of the planets were discovered from their transits in the K2 photometry, while five were found based on subsequent Doppler measurements of transiting planet host stars. The sizes of the transiting planets range from Earth-size to larger than Jupiter (1-3 REarth is typical), while the orbital periods range from less than a day to a few months. For 32 of the planets, the Doppler signal was detected with significance greater than 5-sigma (51 were detected with >3-sigma significance). An important characteristic of this catalog is the use of uniform analysis procedures to determine stellar and planetary properties. This includes the transit search and fitting procedures applied to the K2 photometry, the Doppler fitting techniques applied to the radial velocities, and the spectral modeling to determine bulk stellar parameters. Such a uniform treatment will make the catalog useful for statistical studies of the masses, densities, and system architectures of exoplanetary systems. This work also serves as a data release for all previously unpublished RVs and associated stellar activity indicators obtained by our team for these systems, along with derived stellar and planet parameters.         |

|**Abstract**|            A dedicated search for upward-going air showers at zenith angles exceeding $110^\circ$ and energies $E>0.1$ EeV has been performed using the Fluorescence Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The search is motivated by two "anomalous" radio pulses observed by the ANITA flights I and III which appear inconsistent with the Standard Model of particle physics. Using simulations of both regular cosmic ray showers and upward-going events, a selection procedure has been defined to separate potential upward-going candidate events and the corresponding exposure has been calculated in the energy range [0.1-33] EeV. One event has been found in the search period between 1 Jan 2004 and 31 Dec 2018, consistent with an expected background of $0.27 \pm 0.12$ events from mis-reconstructed cosmic ray showers. This translates to an upper bound on the integral flux of $(7.2 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-21}$ cm$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ y$^{-1}$ and $(3.6 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-20}$ cm$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ y$^{-1}$ for an $E^{-1}$ and $E^{-2}$ spectrum, respectively. An upward-going flux of showers normalized to the ANITA observations is shown to predict over 34 events for an $E^{-3}$ spectrum and over 8.1 events for a conservative $E^{-5}$ spectrum, in strong disagreement with the interpretation of the anomalous events as upward-going showers.         |

|**Abstract**|            Understanding the co-evolution between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies provides crucial insights into SMBH formation and galaxy assembly in these cosmic ecosystems. However, measuring this co-evolution, as traced by the black hole mass - stellar mass relation towards the early Universe, often suffers from significant sample selection biases. Samples selected based on the luminosity of the SMBH would preferentially find overly massive black holes relative to their host stellar mass, missing the population of lower-mass SMBHs that are underrepresented. Here we report the discovery of 13 moderate-luminosity broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei from a galaxy-based selection of 52 massive galaxies at z~3-5. The derived SMBH masses for these AGNs yield a mean SMBH-to-stellar mass ratio of ~0.1%, consistent with the local value. There is limited evolution in this mean mass ratio traced back to z~6, indicating that a significant population of ''normal'' SMBHs already existed within the first billion years of the Universe. Combined with the previous sample of overmassive black holes, there must be diverse pathways for SMBH formation in high-redshift galaxies. Most of these galaxies are experiencing star formation quenching by the observed epoch, suggesting the formation of massive quiescent galaxies does not necessarily require an overly massive black hole, contrary to some theoretical predictions.         |

|**Abstract**|            We compare measurements of star formation efficiency to cloud-scale gas properties across PHANGS-ALMA. Dividing 67 galaxies into 1.5 kpc scale regions, we calculate the molecular gas depletion time, tau_dep= Sigma_mol/Sigma_SFR, and the star formation efficiency per free-fall time, eff=tau_ff/tau_dep, for each region. Then we test how tau_dep and eff vary as functions of the regional mass-weighted mean molecular gas properties on cloud scales (60-150pc): gas surface density, <Sigma_mol^cloud>, velocity dispersion, <sigma_mol^cloud>, virial parameter, <alpha_vir^cloud>, and gravitational free-fall time, <tau_ff^cloud>. <tau_ff^cloud> and tau_dep correlate positively, consistent with the expectation that gas density plays a key role in setting the rate of star formation. Our fiducial measurements suggest tau_dep \propto <tau_ff^cloud>^0.5 and eff \approx 0.34%, though the exact numbers depend on the adopted fitting methods. We also observe anti-correlations between tau_dep and <Sigma_mol^cloud> and between tau_dep^mol and <sigma_mol^cloud> . All three correlations may reflect the same underlying link between density and star formation efficiency combined with systematic variations in the degree to which self-gravity binds molecular gas in galaxies. We highlight the tau_dep-<sigma_mol^cloud> relation because of the lower degree of correlation between the axes. Contrary to theoretical expectations, we observe an anti-correlation between tau_dep^mol and <alpha_vir^cloud> and no significant correlation between eff and <alpha_vir^cloud>. Our results depend sensitively on the adopted CO-to-H2 conversion factor, with corrections for excitation and emissivity effects in inner galaxies playing an important role. We emphasize that our simple methodology and clean selection allow easy comparison to numerical simulations and highlight this as a logical next direction.         |
