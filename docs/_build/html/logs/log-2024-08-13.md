|**Abstract**|            Euclid will provide deep NIR imaging to $\sim$26.5 AB magnitude over $\sim$59 deg$^2$ in its deep and auxiliary fields. The Cosmic DAWN survey complements the deep Euclid data with matched depth multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopy in the UV--IR to provide consistently processed Euclid selected photometric catalogs, accurate photometric redshifts, and measurements of galaxy properties to a redshift of $z\sim 10$. In this paper, we present an overview of the survey, including the footprints of the survey fields, the existing and planned observations, and the primary science goals for the combined data set.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Cosmic Dawn Survey (DAWN survey) provides multiwavelength (UV/optical to mid-IR) data across the combined 59 deg$^{2}$ of the Euclid Deep and Auxiliary fields (EDFs and EAFs). Here, the first public data release (DR1) from the DAWN survey is presented. DR1 catalogues are made available for a subset of the full DAWN survey that consists of two Euclid Deep fields: Euclid Deep Field North (EDF-N) and Euclid Deep Field Fornax (EDF-F). The DAWN survey DR1 catalogues do not include $Euclid$ data as they are not yet public for these fields. Nonetheless, each field has been covered by the ongoing Hawaii Twenty Square Degree Survey (H20), which includes imaging from CFHT MegaCam in the new $u$ filter and from Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) in the $griz$ filters. Each field is further covered by $Spitzer$/IRAC 3.6-4.5$\mu$m imaging spanning 10 deg$^{2}$ and reaching $\sim$25 mag AB (5$\sigma$). All present H20 imaging and all publicly available imaging from the aforementioned facilities are combined with the deep $Spitzer$/IRAC data to create source catalogues spanning a total area of 16.87 deg$^{2}$ in EDF-N and 2.85 deg$^{2}$ in EDF-F for this first release. Photometry is measured using The Farmer, a well-validated model-based photometry code. Photometric redshifts and stellar masses are computed using two independent codes for modeling spectral energy distributions: EAZY and LePhare. Photometric redshifts show good agreement with spectroscopic redshifts ($\sigma_{\rm NMAD} \sim 0.5, \eta < 8\%$ at $i < 25$). Number counts, photometric redshifts, and stellar masses are further validated in comparison to the COSMOS2020 catalogue. The DAWN survey DR1 catalogues are designed to be of immediate use in these two EDFs and will be continuously updated. Future data releases will provide catalogues of all EDFs and EAFs and include $Euclid$ data.         |

|**Abstract**|            Hot and warm Jupiters might have undergone the same formation and evolution path, but the two populations exhibit different distributions of orbital parameters, challenging our understanding on their actual origin. The present work, which is the results of our warm Jupiters survey carried out with the CHIRON spectrograph within the KESPRINT collaboration, aims to address this challenge by studying two planets that could help bridge the gap between the two populations. We report the confirmation and mass determination of a hot Jupiter (orbital period shorter than 10 days), TOI-2420\,b, and a warm Jupiter, TOI-2485\,b. We performed a joint analysis using a wide variety of spectral and photometric data in order to characterize these planetary systems. We found that TOI-2420\,b has an orbital period of P$_{\rm b}$=5.8 days, a mass of M$_{\rm b}$=0.9 M$_{\rm J}$ and a radius of R$_{\rm b}$=1.3 R$_{\rm J}$, with a planetary density of 0.477 \gc; while TOI-2485\,b has an orbital period of P$_{\rm b}$=11.2 days, a mass of M$_{\rm b}$=2.4 M$_{\rm J}$ and a radius of R$_{\rm b}$=1.1 R$_{\rm J}$ with density 2.36 \gc. With current parameters, the migration history for TOI-2420\,b and TOI-2485\,b is unclear: the high-eccentricity migration scenarios cannot be ruled out, and TOI-2485\,b's characteristics may rather support this scenario.         |

|| <mark>B. Maity</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a crucial link to grasp the complete evolutionary history of the universe. Several attempts with a variety of observables have been utilized in the past to understand the thermal and ionization evolution of the Intergalactic Medium during EoR. In this study, we explore the simultaneous prospects of two important observables which are expected to be available in the near future, i.e. Dispersion Measure (DM) of high redshift FRBs and large scale 21 cm power spectra. For this purpose, we use an earlier developed explicitly photon conserving semi numerical model, $\texttt{SCRIPT}$ including realistic recombination and radiative feedback effect. We check that DM evolution of 100 mock FRBs at high redshifts ($7.0\le z\le15.0$) is sufficient to recover the underlying reionization model, while 1000 FRB mocks at redshift range can constrain the reionization timeline within the percentage level uncertainties at 68\% confidence limit. Further, we study the effect of including large scale 21~cm power spectra (using only a single bin, $k\sim0.14~h/\mathrm{cMpc}$) at three redshifts along with FRB DM distribution. The joint exploration using these two observables can significantly improve the constraints on the various parameters ($\lesssim 8\%$ uncertainties for reionization interval and midpoint at 95\% confidence) alleviating the degeneracies and can narrow down the thermal history of the universe by discarding some of the extreme heating models.         |

|| J. E. MÃ©ndez-Delgado, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. Kreckel</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            In stars, metallicity is usually traced using Fe, while in nebulae, O serves as the preferred proxy. Both elements have different nucleosynthetic origins and are not directly comparable. Additionally, in ionized nebulae, Fe is heavily depleted onto dust grains. We investigate the distribution of Fe gas abundances in a sample of 452 star-forming nebulae with \feiii~$\lambda 4658$ detections and their relationship with O and N. Additionally, we analyze the depletion of Fe onto dust grains in photoionized environments. We homogeneously determine the chemical abundances with direct determinations of electron temperature ($T_e$), considering the effect of possible internal variations of this parameter. We adopt a sample of 300 Galactic stars to interpret the nebular findings. We find a moderate linear correlation ($r=-0.59$) between Fe/O and O/H. In turn, we report a stronger correlation ($r=-0.80$) between Fe/N and N/H. We interpret the tighter correlation as evidence of Fe and N being produced on similar timescales while Fe-dust depletion scales with the Fe availability. The apparently flat distribution between Fe/N and N/H in Milky Way stars supports this interpretation. We find that when 12+log(O/H)<7.6, the nebulae seem to reach a plateau value around $\text{log(Fe/O)} \approx -1.7$. If this trend is confirmed, it would be consistent with a very small amount of Fe-dust in these systems, similar to what is observed in high-z galaxies discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We derive a relationship that allows us to approximate the fraction of Fe trapped into dust in ionized nebulae. If the O-dust scales in the same way, its possible contribution in low metallicity nebulae would be negligible. After analyzing the Fe/O abundances in J0811+4730 and J1631+4426, we do not see evidence of the presence of very massive stars with $M_\text{init}>300M_{\odot}$ in these systems.         |

|| Y. Cai, Y. Hou, T. Li, <mark>J. Liu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-08-13*|
|*Comments*| *Comments welcome. 18 pages, 9 figures, 1 table*|
|**Abstract**|            White-light flares (WLFs) are energetic activity in stellar atmosphere. However, the observed solar WLF is relatively rare compared to stellar WLFs or solar flares observed at other wavelengths, limiting our further understanding solar/stellar WLFs through statistical studies. By analyzing flare observations from the \emph{Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)}, here we improve WLF identification methods for obtaining more solar WLFs and their accurate light curves from two aspects: 1) imposing constraints defined by the typical temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of WLF-induced signals; 2) setting the intrinsic threshold for each pixel in the flare ribbon region according to its inherent background fluctuation rather than a fixed threshold for the whole region. Applying the optimized method to 90 flares (30 C-class ones, 30 M-class ones, and 30 X-class ones) for a statistical study, we identified a total of 9 C-class WLFs, 18 M-class WLFs, and 28 X-class WLFs. The WLF identification rate of C-class flares reported here reaches 30\%, which is the highest to date to our best knowledge. It is also revealed that in each GOES energy level, the proportion of WLFs is higher in confined flares than that in eruptive flares. Moreover, a power-law relation is found between the WLF energy (\emph{E}) and duration ($\tau$): $\tau \propto {E}^{0.22}$, similar to those of solar hard/soft X-ray flares and other stellar WLFs. These results indicate that we could recognize more solar WLFs through optimizing the identification method, which will lay a base for future statistical and comparison study of solar and stellar WLFs.         |

|| D. Tan, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            The Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) constitutes a mission intricately designed to systematically survey approximately 100 solar-type stars located within the immediate proximity of the solar system, specifically within a range of 10 parsecs. The core objective of this mission is the detection and characterization of potentially habitable Earth-like planets or super-Earths within the habitable zone of these stars. The CHES mission obtains high-precision astrometric measurements of planets orbiting the target stars by observing angular distance variations between the target star and reference stars. As a result, we surveyed the relevant parameters of both target and reference stars in detail, conducting a thorough analysis and calculation of the required observation accuracy, the number of observations, and the priority assigned to each target star. Observational emphasis will be concentrated on targets considered of higher priority, ensuring the effectiveness of their observation capabilities. Through this approach, we formulate a five-year observation strategy that will cover all the target stars within a six-month timeframe. The strategy not only fulfills the required observing capability but also exhibit high efficiency simultaneously, providing an executable program for future mission. Over the span of the mission's five-year duration, a cumulative observation time of 29,220 hours will be available. Approximately 86 percent of this, totaling 25,120 hours, is allocated for the observation of target stars. This allocation leaves approximately 4,100 hours for extended scientific observation programs. We have also performed simulated observations based on this strategy and verified its observational capability for exoplanets.         |

|| P. A. Collaboration, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-08-13*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            Results are presented for the measurement of large-scale anisotropies in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays detected at the Pierre Auger Observatory during 19 years of operation, prior to AugerPrime, the upgrade of the Observatory. The 3D dipole amplitude and direction are reconstructed above $4\,$EeV in four energy bins. Besides the established dipolar anisotropy in right ascension above $8\,$EeV, the Fourier amplitude of the $8$ to $16\,$EeV energy bin is now also above the $5\sigma$ discovery level. No time variation of the dipole moment above $8\,$EeV is found, setting an upper limit to the rate of change of such variations of $0.3\%$ per year at the $95\%$ confidence level. Additionally, the results for the angular power spectrum are shown, demonstrating no other statistically significant multipoles. The results for the equatorial dipole component down to $0.03\,$EeV are presented, using for the first time a data set obtained with a trigger that has been optimized for lower energies. Finally, model predictions are discussed and compared with observations, based on two source emission scenarios obtained in the combined fit of spectrum and composition above $0.6\,$EeV.         |

|**Abstract**|            We investigate the ability of the Euclid telescope to detect galaxy-scale gravitational lenses. To do so, we perform a systematic visual inspection of the $0.7\,\rm{deg}^2$ Euclid ERO data towards the Perseus cluster using both the high-resolution VIS $I_{\scriptscriptstyle\rm E}$ band, and the lower resolution NISP bands. We inspect every extended source brighter than magnitude $23$ in $I_{\scriptscriptstyle\rm E}$ with $41$ expert human classifiers. This amounts to $12\,086$ stamps of $10^{\prime\prime}\,\times\,10^{\prime\prime}$. We find $3$ grade A and $13$ grade B candidates. We assess the validity of these $16$ candidates by modelling them and checking that they are consistent with a single source lensed by a plausible mass distribution. Five of the candidates pass this check, five others are rejected by the modelling and six are inconclusive. Extrapolating from the five successfully modelled candidates, we infer that the full $14\,000\,{\rm deg}^2$ of the Euclid Wide Survey should contain $100\,000^{+70\,000}_{-30\,000}$ galaxy-galaxy lenses that are both discoverable through visual inspection and have valid lens models. This is consistent with theoretical forecasts of $170\,000$ discoverable galaxy-galaxy lenses in Euclid. Our five modelled lenses have Einstein radii in the range $0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}68\,<\,\theta_\mathrm{E}\,<1.\!\!^{\prime\prime}24$, but their Einstein radius distribution is on the higher side when compared to theoretical forecasts. This suggests that our methodology is likely missing small Einstein radius systems. Whilst it is implausible to visually inspect the full Euclid data set, our results corroborate the promise that Euclid will ultimately deliver a sample of around $10^5$ galaxy-scale lenses.         |
