|**Abstract**|            The joint capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST allow for an unparalleled look at the early lives of star clusters at near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. We present here a multiband analysis of embedded young stellar clusters in 11 nearby, star-forming galaxies, using the PHANGS-JWST and PHANGS-HST datasets. We use the Zooniverse citizen science platform to conduct an initial by-eye search for embedded clusters in near-UV/optical/near-infrared images that trace stellar continuum emission, the Paschen$\alpha$ and H$\alpha$ recombination lines, and the 3.3 $\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon feature and its underlying continuum. With this approach, we identify 292 embedded cluster candidates for which we characterize their ages, masses, and levels of line-of-sight extinction by comparing the photometric data to predictions from stellar population models. The embedded cluster candidates have a median age of 4.5 Myr and an average line-of-sight extinction $\left< A_V \right> = 6.0$ mag. We determine lower limits on source stellar masses, resulting in a median stellar mass of $10^3$ $M_{\odot}$. We use this sample of embedded cluster candidates to train multiple convolutional neural network models to carry out deep transfer learning-based searches for embedded clusters. With the aim of optimizing models for future catalog production, we compare results for four variations of training data using two neural networks. Confusion matrices for all eight model configurations, as well as inter-model identification trends, are presented. With refinement of the training sample, we determine that optimized models could serve as a pathway for future embedded cluster identification beyond our 11 galaxy sample.         |

|**Abstract**|            Probing the presence and properties of massive galaxies at high redshift is one of the most critical tests for galaxy formation models. In this work, we search for galaxies with stellar masses M* > 10^10.25 Msun at z in [5,7], i.e., towards the end of the Epoch of Reionisation, over a total of ~23 deg^2 in two of the Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) fields: the Euclid Deep Field North and Fornax (EDF-N and EDF-F). In addition to the Euclid photometry, we incorporate Spitzer Infrared Camera (IRAC) and ground-based optical data to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, obtaining photometric redshifts and derived physical parameters. After applying rigorous selection criteria, we identify a conservative sample of 145 candidate massive galaxies with M* > 10^10.25 Msun at z in [5,7], including 5 objects with M* > 10^11 Msun. This makes for a surface density of about 6.3 deg^-2 at z in [5,7], which should be considered a lower limit because of the current depth of the Euclid data (H_E < 24, 5 sigma in Q1). We find that the inferred stellar masses are consistent with galaxy formation models with standard star-formation efficiencies. These massive galaxies have colour excess E(B-V) values up to 0.75, indicating significant dust attenuation in some of them. In addition, half of the massive galaxies have best-fit ages comparable to the age of the Universe at those redshifts, which suggests that their progenitors were formed very early in cosmic time. About 78% of the massive galaxies lie on the star-forming main sequence (MS) in the SFR-M* plane, ~12% are found in the starburst region, and 10% in the transition zone between the MS and starbursts. We find no significant evidence for outshining or AGN contamination that could account for the elevated specific star-formation rates (sSFR) observed in the ~12% of galaxies classified as starbursts.         |

|**Abstract**|            WASP-80 b is an unusually low-density exoplanet in tension with the metal-rich composition expected for a planet of its mass. We aim to derive precise constraints on WASP-80 b's bulk metal mass fraction, atmospheric composition, and thermal structure. We conducted a suite of retrievals using three approaches: traditional interior-only, atmosphere-only, and joint interior-atmosphere retrievals. We coupled the open-source models GASTLI and petitRADTRANS, which describe planetary structure and thermal evolution, and atmospheric chemistry and clouds, respectively. Our retrievals combine mass and age with panchromatic spectra from JWST and HST in both transmission (0.5-4 $\mu$m) and emission (1-12 $\mu$m) as observational constraints. We identify two fiducial scenarios. In the first, WASP-80 b has an internal temperature consistent with its age in the absence of external heating sources, and its atmosphere is in chemical equilibrium, with an atmospheric metallicity M/H = 2.75$^{+0.88}_{-0.56}$x solar, a bulk metal mass fraction $Z_{planet}=0.12\pm0.02$, and a core mass $M_{core}=3.49^{+3.49}_{-1.59} \ M_{\oplus}$. In the second scenario, WASP-80 b may be inflated by an additional heat source - possibly induced by magnetic fields - with an atmospheric metallicity M/H = 10.00$^{+8.20}_{-4.75}$x solar, $Z_{planet}=0.28\pm0.11$, and $M_{core}=31.8^{+21.3}_{-17.5} \ M_{\oplus}$. The super-solar M/H and sub-solar C/O ratios in both scenarios suggest late pebble or planetesimal accretion, while additional heating is required to reconcile the data with the more massive core predicted by the core accretion paradigm. In general, joint retrievals are inherently affected by a degeneracy between atmospheric chemistry and internal structure. Together with flexible cloud treatment and an unweighted likelihood, this leads to larger uncertainties in bulk and atmospheric compositions than previously claimed.         |

|**Abstract**|            Aims. We present and analyse the detailed physical properties of six binary stellar systems, originally proposed as possible star-black hole binaries on the basis of radial velocities from Gaia's third data release, but soon recognised as likely post-mass-transfer binary systems with stripped companions. Methods. We used multi-epoch high-resolution FEROS spectra and spectral disentangling paired with stellar templates to derive effective temperatures, $T_\mathrm{eff}$; stellar radii, R*; and projected rotational velocities, v$\sin{i}$ for both components in all systems along with the mass ratio, q = $M_\mathrm{accretor}/M_\mathrm{donor}$ and the components' flux ratio as a function of wavelength. Results. Our analysis directly confirms that all systems are post-mass-transfer binaries with two luminous stars, i.e. no black hole companions. Each system contains an A-type accretor component that is rapidly rotating and a cooler very low-mass donor (~ 0.25M$\odot$) that is overluminous. Five of the systems show no trace of any emission lines, implying that there is no current mass transfer, consistent with our inferred radii, in all cases within the Roche volume. The data are generally consistent with stable case AB mass transfer with $\beta$ (the fraction of mass lost from the accretor) less than 0.7. While the accretor components rotate rapidly, they rotate well below the critical rotation rate, $v_\mathrm{crit}$, even though there must have been enough mass transfer to spin them up to a significant fraction of $v_\mathrm{crit}$, according to theoretical models of angular momentum transfer. As neither magnetic braking nor tidal synchronisation should have been effective in spinning down the stars, our results suggest that either mass accretion does not increase the angular momentum of the accretors to their critical values or the systems never reached these values in the first place.         |

|| J.-Y. Song, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-11-18*|
|*Comments*| *10 pages, 3 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            Recently, the combination of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data and the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements has shown a $\sim$3$\sigma$ preference for a dynamical dark energy model with a phantom-crossing behavior. However, such a phantom-crossing dark energy evolution further exacerbates the already severe Hubble tension in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Moreover, there exists a $\sim2\sigma$ tension between the DESI DR2 BAO and CMB datasets. Therefore, it is essential to measure the Hubble constant and dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameters using only late-universe observations. In this work, we investigate a novel late-universe data combination: gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens, BAO, and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). This combination provides a fully distance-ladder- and CMB-independent determination of the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS. Using 47 GW standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, the DESI DR2 BAO data, and DESY5 SNe Ia data, in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we obtain $H_0=74.8^{+6.3}_{-8.9}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.320^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$, $w_0=-0.775^{+0.072}_{-0.074}$, and $w_a=-0.80\pm0.47$, indicating a mild phantom-crossing behavior within the $1\sigma$ credible interval with an $H_0$ value consistent with the distance ladder measurements. Our analysis demonstrates the power of GW standard sirens in breaking parameter degeneracies, and this novel data combination provides joint constraints on the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS parameters.         |

|| Y. Ma, et al. -- incl., <mark>M. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-11-18*|
|*Comments*| *12 pages and 7 Figures*|
|**Abstract**|            We use $^{12}$CO (J=1-0) MWISP data to study turbulence in a segment of the Local Arm. Velocity slices at different kinematic distances show similar spatial power spectra (SPSs) and structure functions (SFs), demonstrating that the entire region forms a single turbulent field with a cascade extending from $\sim 400$ pc to sub-parsec scales. The SPS slopes of both the intensity and velocity fields exhibit a systematic scale dependence that approaches the values expected from turbulence models. Cloud-to-cloud VSFs follow similar trends to the pixel-by-pixel VSFs in the extended self-similarity (ESS) scaling, indicating that velocity differences among clouds arise from large-scale turbulent motions. Velocity- and intensity-increment maps reveal filamentary, intermittent structures. The PDFs of the velocity increments display strong non-Gaussianity and are well fitted by the normal inverse gaussian (NIG) distribution, whereas the intensity increments show much weaker tails. A simple energetic estimate suggests that Galactic differential rotation is able to supply the large-scale shear required to maintain the observed turbulence.         |

|| <mark>Y. Wang</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-11-18*|
|*Comments*| *76 pages, 13 figures (initial submission; in press at Science Advances)*|
|**Abstract**|            Theories and simulations predict that intense spacetime curvature near black holes bends the trajectories of light and matter, driving disk and jet precession under relativistic torques. However, direct observational evidence of disk-jet co-precession remains elusive. Here, we report the most compelling case to date: a tidal disruption event (TDE) exhibiting unprecedented 19.6-day quasi-periodic variations in both X-rays and radio, with X-ray amplitudes exceeding an order of magnitude. The nearly synchronized X-ray and radio variations suggest a shared mechanism regulating the emission regions. We demonstrate that a disk-jet Lense-Thirring precession model successfully reproduces these variations while requiring a low-spin black hole. This study uncovers previously uncharted short-term radio variability in TDEs, highlights the transformative potential of high-cadence radio monitoring, and offers profound insights into disk-jet physics.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST), a two-meter aperture astronomical space telescope under China's manned space program, is equipped with multiple back-end scientific instruments. As an astronomical precision measurement module of the CSST, the Multi-Channel Imager (MCI) can cover a wide wavelength range from ultraviolet to near-infrared with three-color simultaneous high-precision photometry and imaging, which meets the scientific requirements for various fields. The diverse scientific objectives of MCI require not only a robust airborne platform, advanced optical systems, and observing facilities but also comprehensive software support for scientific operations and research. To this end, it is essential to develop realistic observational simulation software to thoroughly evaluate the MCI data stream and provide calibration tools for future scientific investigations. The MCI instrument simulation software will serve as a foundation for the development of the MCI data processing pipeline and will facilitate improvements in both hardware and software, as well as in the observational operation strategy, in alignment with the mission's scientific goals. In conclusion, we present a comprehensive overview of the MCI instrument simulation and some corresponding performances of the MCI data processing pipeline.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2025-11-18*|

|**Abstract**|            The Low Energy Polarization Detector (LPD) is a key component of the next-generation large-scale Gamma-Ray Burst polarimeter, POLAR-2. It is designed for polarization observations of transient sources in the soft X-ray energy range with a wide field of view (FOV). To validate the key technologies required for wide-FOV X-ray polarization measurements, the Cosmic X-ray Polarization Detector (CXPD) CubeSat was developed as a prototype for the LPD. The CXPD is equipped with two Gas Microchannel Plate Pixel Detectors (GMPDs) that measure X-ray polarization via the photoelectric effect, where ejected photoelectrons produce ionization tracks in the gas which are imaged to reconstruct their emission directions. Laboratory calibrations of the modulation factor and energy spectra were successfully performed using linear polarized X-ray sources at 2.98 keV, 4.51 keV, 6.40 keV, and 8.05 keV. Since its launch in June 2023, the CXPD has successfully completed critical in-orbit technology verification. It has also performed polarization observations of two bright X-ray sources Sco X-1 and the transient Swift J1727.8-1613 yielding constraints on their polarization degrees and angles. Notably, this was the first time that an anti-coincidence detector had been implemented in an X-ray polarimeter, enabling in-orbit verification of the charged-particle background rejection algorithm. These results demonstrate the feasibility of wide-field soft X-ray polarization measurements and provide essential guidance for the development of the LPD for the POLAR-2 mission, thereby advancing the frontier of X-ray polarization astronomy.         |
