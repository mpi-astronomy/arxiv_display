|**Abstract**| MIRI/MRS on board the JWST allows us to probe the inner regions of protoplanetary disks. Here we examine the disk around the classical T Tauri star Sz 98, which has an unusually large dust disk in the millimetre with a compact core. We focus on the H$_2$O emission through both its ro-vibrational and pure rotational emission. Furthermore, we compare our chemical findings with those obtained for the outer disk from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. In order to model the molecular features in the spectrum, the continuum was subtracted and LTE slab models were fitted. The spectrum was divided into different wavelength regions corresponding to H$_2$O lines of different excitation conditions, and the slab model fits were performed individually per region. We confidently detect CO, H$_2$O, OH, CO$_2$, and HCN in the emitting layers. The isotopologue H$^{18}_2$O is not detected. Additionally, no other organics, including C$_2$H$_2$, are detected. This indicates that the C/O ratio could be substantially below unity, in contrast with the outer disk. The H$_2$O emission traces a large radial disk surface region, as evidenced by the gradually changing excitation temperatures and emitting radii. The OH and CO$_2$ emission are relatively weak. It is likely that H$_2$O is not significantly photodissociated; either due to self-shielding against the stellar irradiation, or UV-shielding from small dust particles. The relative emitting strength of the different identified molecular features point towards UV-shielding of H$_2$O in the inner disk of Sz 98, with a thin layer of OH on top. The majority of the organic molecules are either hidden below the dust continuum, or not present. In general, the inferred composition points to a sub-solar C/O ratio (<0.5) in the inner disk, in contrast with the larger than unity C/O ratio in the gas in the outer disk found with ALMA. |

|**Abstract**| In the manuscript, a candidate of sub-pc binary black hole (BBH) system is reported in SDSS J1257+2023 through different properties of broad Balmer emission lines. After subtractions of host galaxy contributions, Gaussian functions are applied to measure emission lines in SDSS J1257+2023, leading line width (second moment) 760${\rm km/s}$ of broad H$\beta$ to be 0.69 times of line width 1100${\rm km/s}$ of broad H$\alpha$, quite different from normal line width ratio 1.1 of broad H$\beta$ to broad H$\alpha$ in quasars. The quite broader component in broad H$\alpha$ in SDSS J1257+2023 can be confirmed with confidence level higher than $5\sigma$ through F-test technique, through different model functions applied to measure emission lines. The broad Balmer emission lines having different line widths can be naturally explained by a BBH system with different obscurations on central two independent BLRs. Meanwhile, through ZTF light curves and corresponding phase folded light curves well described by sinusoidal function, BBH system expected optical QPOs can be detected with periodicity about 1000days, confirmed with confidence level higher than $3\sigma$ by Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram. And through CAR process simulated light curves, confidence level higher than $2\sigma$ can be determined to support the optical QPOs in SDSS J1257+2023 not from intrinsic AGN activities, although the ZTF light curves have short time durations. Moreover, through oversimplified BBH system simulated results, studying different broad Balmer lines as signs of BBH systems in normal quasars with flux ratios around 4 of broad H$\alpha$ to broad H$\beta$ could be done in near future. |
