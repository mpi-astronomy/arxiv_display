|**Abstract**| In the process of producing the roughly three ionizing photons per atom required to reionize the IGM, the same massive stars explode and eject metals into their surroundings. While the overly sensitive Lya transition makes Gunn-Peterson absorption of background quasar light an ineffective probe of reionization at z > 6, strong low-ionization transitions like the MgII doublet will give rise to a detectable "metal-line forest", if metals pollute the neutral IGM. We measure the auto-correlation of the MgII forest transmission using a sample of ten ground based z >= 6.80 quasar spectra probing the redshift range 5.96 < z_MgII < 7.42 (z_MgII,median = 6.47). The correlation function exhibits strong small-scale clustering and a pronounced peak at the doublet velocity (768 km/s) arising from strong absorbers in the CGM of galaxies. After these strong absorbers are identified and masked the signal is consistent with noise. Our measurements are compared to a suite of models generated by combining a large hydrodynamical simulation with a semi-numerical reionization topology, assuming a simple uniform enrichment model. We obtain a 95% credibility upper limit of [Mg/H] < -3.73 at z_MgII,median = 6.47, assuming uninformative priors on [Mg/H] and the IGM neutral fraction x_HI. Splitting the data into low-z (5.96 < z_MgII < 6.47; z_MgII,median = 6.235) and high-z (6.47 < z_MgII < 7.42; z_MgII,median = 6.72) subsamples again yields null-detections and 95% upper limits of [Mg/H] < -3.75 and [Mg/H] < -3.45, respectively. These first measurements set the stage for an approved JWST Cycle 2 program (GO 3526) targeting a similar number of quasars that will be an order of magnitude more sensitive, making the Mgii forest an emerging powerful tool to deliver precision constraints on the reionization and enrichment history of the Universe. |

|**Abstract**| Yttrium (Y), a key s-process element, is commonly used in nucleosynthesis studies and as a Galactic chemical clock when combined with magnesium (Mg). We study the applicability of the previously assumed LTE line formation assumption in Y abundance studies of main-sequence and red giant stars, and probe the impact of NLTE effects on the [Y/Mg] ratio, a proposed stellar age indicator. We derive stellar parameters, ages, and NLTE abundances of Fe, Mg, and Y for 48 solar analogue stars from high-resolution spectra acquired within the Gaia-ESO survey. For Y, we present a new NLTE atomic model. We determine a solar NLTE abundance of A(Y)$_{\rm NLTE}=2.12\pm0.04$ dex, $0.04$ dex higher than LTE. NLTE effects on Y abundance are modest for optical Y II lines, which are frequently used in Sun-like stars diagnostics. NLTE has a small impact on the [Y/Mg] ratio in such stars. For metal-poor red giants, NLTE effects on Y II lines are substantial, potentially exceeding $+0.5$ dex. For the Gaia/4MOST/WEAVE benchmark star, HD 122563, we find the NLTE abundance ratio of [Y/Fe]$_{\rm NLTE}=-0.55\pm0.04$ dex with consistent abundances obtained from different Y II lines. NLTE has a differential effect on Y abundance diagnostics in late-type stars. They notably affect Y II lines in red giants and very metal-poor stars, which are typical Galactic enrichment tracers of neutron-capture elements. For main-sequence stars, NLTE effects on optical diagnostic Y II lines remain minimal across metallicities. This affirms the [Y/Mg] ratio's reliability as a cosmochronometer for Sun-like stars. |

|**Abstract**| Heliophysics is the field that ``studies the nature of the Sun, and how it influences the very nature of space - and, in turn, the atmospheres of planetary bodies and the technology that exists there.'' However, NASA's Heliophysics Division tends to limit study of planetary magnetospheres and atmospheres to only those of Earth. This leaves exploration and understanding of space plasma physics at other worlds to the purview of the Planetary Science and Astrophysics Divisions. This is detrimental to the study of space plasma physics in general since, although some cross-divisional funding opportunities do exist, vital elements of space plasma physics can be best addressed by extending the expertise of Heliophysics scientists to other stellar and planetary magnetospheres. However, the diverse worlds within the solar system provide crucial environmental conditions that are not replicated at Earth but can provide deep insight into fundamental space plasma physics processes. Studying planetary systems with Heliophysics objectives, comprehensive instrumentation, and new grant opportunities for analysis and modeling would enable a novel understanding of fundamental and universal processes of space plasma physics. As such, the Heliophysics community should be prepared to consider, prioritize, and fund dedicated Heliophysics efforts to planetary targets to specifically study space physics and aeronomy objectives. |
