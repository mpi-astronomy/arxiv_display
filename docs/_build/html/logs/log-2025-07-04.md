|**Abstract**|            We present a robust, apples-to-apples comparison between the photometric properties of the intracluster light (ICL) in the TNG300 magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulation and those in Wendelstein Wide Field Imager (WWFI) observations. This is accomplished by generating synthetic $g'$-band images of 40 massive ($\log\left(M_{\rm 200, crit}/{\rm M}_{\odot}\right) > 14.5$) TNG300 clusters at $z \approx 0.06$, closely mimicking WWFI observations, and then performing identical photometric calculations on the synthetic and real images. Importantly, we apply the same observationally motivated satellite-masking procedure to both data-sets, which effectively removes any possible biases introduced by the halo finder. We first analyze the light distribution of the `smooth' stellar component of each cluster, composed of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) plus the ICL, and find that it tends to be about twice as extended in TNG300 than in observations, while also being approximately 1 $g'$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ brighter. We then quantify $f_{\rm ICL}$, the ICL fraction relative to the BCG+ICL, by considering several ICL definitions: (i) the light dimmer than a surface brightness cut at 27 $g'$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$, (ii) the excess light over a de Vaucouleurs profile, (iii) the light beyond twice the half-light radius ($2 r_{\rm half}$), and (iv) the light beyond a fixed circular aperture of 30, 50, or 100 kpc. For most definitions, the median $f_{\rm ICL}$ is consistent between simulation and observations. However, the observations exhibit larger scatter in $f_{\rm ICL}$, which we attribute primarily to observational uncertainties in the total BCG+ICL luminosity rather than `true' cluster-to-cluster variation in the real Universe. We also find that most methods yield median $f_{\rm ICL}$ values near 0.3, which is consistent with a BCG/ICL transition radius around $2 r_{\rm half}$.         |

|**Abstract**|            In this study, we report multi-year polarization measurements of four repeating FRBs initially discovered by CHIME: FRBs~20190117A, 20190208A, 20190303A, and 20190417A. We observed the four repeating FRBs with FAST, detecting a total of 66 bursts. Two bursts from FRB~20190417A exhibit a circular polarization signal-to-noise ratio greater than 7, with the highest circular polarization fraction recorded at 35.7%. While the bursts from FRBs 20190208A and 20190303A are highly linearly polarized, those from FRBs~20190117A and 20190417A show depolarization due to multi-path propagation, with \sigma_{\mathrm{RM}} = 2.78 \pm 0.05 rad m$^{-2}$ and 5.19 \pm 0.09 rad m$^{-2}$, respectively. The linear polarization distributions among five repeating FRB--FRBs~20190208A, 20190303A, 20201124A, 20220912A, and 20240114A--are nearly identical but show distinct differences from those of non-repeating FRBs. FRBs~20190117A, 20190303A, and 20190417A exhibit substantial rotation measure (RM) variations between bursts, joining other repeating FRBs in this behavior. Combining these findings with published results, 64% of repeating FRBs show RM variations greater than 50 rad m$^{-2}$, and 21\% exhibit RM reversals. A significant proportion of repeating FRBs reside in a dynamic magneto-ionic environment. The structure function of RM variations shows a power-law index of $\gamma \sim (0-0.8)$, corresponding to a shallow power spectrum $\alpha = -(\gamma + 2) \sim -(2.0-2.8)$ of turbulence, if the RM variations are attributed to turbulence. This suggests that the variations are dominated by small-scale RM density fluctuations. We perform K-S tests comparing the RMs of repeating and non-repeating FRBs, which reveal a marginal dichotomy in the distribution of their this http URL caution that the observed dichotomy may be due to the small sample size and selection biases.         |

|| P. A. Collaboration, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-04*|
|*Comments*| *10 pages, 6 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            We present a novel approach for assessing the muon content of air showers with large zenith angles on a combined analysis of their radio emission and particle footprint. We use the radiation energy reconstructed by the Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) as an energy estimator and determine the muon number independently with the water-Cherenkov detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory, deployed on a 1500 m grid. We focus our analysis on air showers with primary energy above 4 EeV to ensure full detection efficiency. Over approximately ten years of accumulated data, we identify a set of 40 high-quality events that are used in the analysis. The estimated muon contents in data are compatible with those for iron primaries as predicted by current-generation hadronic interaction models. This result can be interpreted as a deficit of muons in simulations as a lighter mass composition has been established from Xmax measurements. This muon deficit was already observed in previous analyses of the Auger Collaboration and is confirmed using hybrid events that include radio measurements for the first time.         |

|| M.-L. Zhao, Y. Shao, S. Wang, <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            Probing the nature of dark matter (DM) remains an outstanding problem in modern cosmology. The 21 cm signal, as a sensitive tracer of neutral hydrogen during cosmic dawn, provides a unique means to investigate DM nature during this critical epoch. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation of primordial black holes (PBHs), can modify the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm power spectrum. Therefore, the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum serves as a powerful tool to investigate such DM processes. In this work, we systematically assess the potential of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to constrain DM and PBH parameters using the 21 cm power spectrum. Assuming $10,000$ hours of integration time, the SKA is projected to reach sensitivities of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \leq 10^{-28}\,{\rm cm}^{3}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ and $\tau\geq 10^{28}\,{\rm seconds}$, for $10\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \leq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the SKA could place constraints on DM annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation that are up to two to three orders of magnitude stronger than current limits. Furthermore, the SKA is expected to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes. Overall, the SKA holds great promise for advancing our understanding of both DM particles and PBHs, potentially offering new insights into the fundamental nature of DM.         |

|| C. Wu, et al. -- incl., <mark>Y. Wang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-04*|
|*Comments*| *31 pages, 9 Figures, 10 Tables*|
|**Abstract**|            Early multi-wavelength observations offer crucial insights into the nature of the relativistic jets responsible for gamma-ray bursts and their interaction with the surrounding this http URL present data of GRB 240825A from 17 space- and ground-based telescopes/instruments, covering wavelengths from NIR/optical to X-ray and GeV, and spanning from the prompt emission to the afterglow phase triggered by Swift and Fermi. The early afterglow observations were carried out by SVOM/C-GFT, and spectroscopic observations of the afterglow by GTC, VLT, and TNG determined the redshift of the burst ($z = 0.659$) later.A comprehensive analysis of the prompt emission spectrum observed by Swift-BAT and Fermi-GBM/LAT reveals a rare and significant high-energy cutoff at ~76 MeV. Assuming this cutoff is due to $\gamma\gamma$ absorption allows us to place an upper limit on the initial Lorentz factor, $\Gamma_0 < 245$. The optical/NIR and GeV afterglow light curves be described by the standard external shock model, with early-time emission dominated by a reverse shock (RS) and a subsequent transition to forward shock (FS) emission. Our afterglow modelling yields a consistent estimate of the initial Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_{\rm 0} \sim 234$). Furthermore, the RS-to-FS magnetic field ratio ($\mathcal{R}_B \sim 302$) indicates that the reverse shock region is significantly more magnetized than the FS region. An isotropic-equivalent kinetic energy of $E_{\text{k,iso}} = 5.25 \times 10^{54}$ erg is derived, and the corresponding $\gamma$-ray radiation efficiency is estimated to be $\eta_{\gamma}$ = 3.1%. On the other hand, the standard afterglow model can not reproduce the X-ray light curve of GRB 240825A, calling for improved models to characterize all multi-wavelength data.         |
