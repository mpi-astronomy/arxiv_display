|**Abstract**| We present a comprehensive catalog of observations and stellar population properties for 23 highly secure host galaxies of fast radio bursts (FRBs). Our sample comprises six repeating FRBs and 17 apparent non-repeaters. We present 82 new photometric and eight new spectroscopic observations of these hosts. Using stellar population synthesis modeling and employing non-parametric star formation histories (SFHs), we find that FRB hosts have a median stellar mass of $\approx 10^{9.8}\,M_{\odot}$, mass-weighted age of $\approx 5.2$ Gyr, and ongoing star formation rate $\approx 1.3\,M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ but span wide ranges in all properties. Classifying the hosts by degree of star formation, we find that 91\% (21/23 hosts) are star-forming, one is transitioning, and one is quiescent. The majority trace the star-forming main sequence of galaxies, but at least two FRBs originate in less active environments, both of which are apparent non-repeaters. Across all modeled properties, we find no statistically significant distinction between the hosts of repeaters and non-repeaters. However, the hosts of repeating FRBs generally extend to lower stellar masses, and the hosts of non-repeaters arise in more optically luminous galaxies. Further, the four galaxies with the most clear and prolonged rises in their SFHs all host repeating FRBs, demonstrating heightened star formation activity in the last $\lesssim 100$ Myr. Our results support the young magnetar model for most FRBs in which their progenitors formed through core-collapse supernovae, but the presence of some FRBs in less active environments suggests that a fraction form through more delayed channels. |

|**Abstract**| TOI-2525 is a K-type star with an estimated mass of M = 0.849$_{-0.033}^{+0.024}$ M$_\odot$ and radius of R = 0.785$_{-0.007}^{+0.007}$ R$_\odot$ observed by the TESS mission in 22 sectors (within sectors 1 and 39). The TESS light curves yield significant transit events of two companions, which show strong transit timing variations (TTVs) with a semi-amplitude of a $\sim$6 hours. We performed TTV dynamical, and photo-dynamical light curve analysis of the TESS data, combined with radial velocity (RV) measurements from FEROS and PFS, and we confirmed the planetary nature of these companions. The TOI-2525 system consists of a transiting pair of planets comparable to Neptune and Jupiter with estimated dynamical masses of $m_{\rm b}$ = 0.088$_{-0.004}^{+0.005}$ M$_{\rm Jup.}$, and $m_{\rm c}$ = 0.709$_{-0.033}^{+0.034}$ M$_{\rm Jup.}$, radius of $r_b$ = 0.88$_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$ R$_{\rm Jup.}$ and $r_c$ = 0.98$_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$ R$_{\rm Jup.}$, and with orbital periods of $P_{\rm b}$ = 23.288$_{-0.002}^{+0.001}$ days and $P_{\rm c}$ = 49.260$_{-0.001}^{+0.001}$ days for the inner and the outer planet, respectively. The period ratio is close to the 2:1 period commensurability, but the dynamical simulations of the system suggest that it is outside the mean motion resonance (MMR) dynamical configuration. TOI-2525 b is among the lowest density Neptune-mass planets known to date, with an estimated median density of $\rho_{\rm b}$ = 0.174$_{-0.015}^{+0.016}$ g\,cm$^{-3}$. The TOI-2525 system is very similar to the other K-dwarf systems discovered by TESS, TOI-2202 and TOI-216, which are composed of almost identical K-dwarf primary and two warm giant planets near the 2:1 MMR. |

|*Comments*| *20 pages, 16 figures*|
|**Abstract**| We study the bar pattern speeds and corotation radii of 225 barred galaxies, using IFU data from MaNGA and the Tremaine-Weinberg method. Our sample, which is divided between strongly and weakly barred galaxies identified via Galaxy Zoo, is the largest that this method has been applied to. We find lower pattern speeds for strongly barred galaxies than for weakly barred galaxies. As simulations show that the pattern speed decreases as the bar exchanges angular momentum with its host, these results suggest that strong bars are more evolved than weak bars. Interestingly, the corotation radius is not different between weakly and strongly barred galaxies, despite being proportional to bar length. We also find that the corotation radius is significantly different between quenching and star forming galaxies. Additionally, we find that strongly barred galaxies have significantly lower values for R, the ratio between the corotation radius and the bar radius, than weakly barred galaxies, despite a big overlap in both distributions. This ratio classifies bars into ultrafast bars (R < 1.0; 11% of our sample), fast bars (1.0 < R < 1.4; 27%) and slow bars (R > 1.4; 62%). Simulations show that R is correlated with the bar formation mechanism, so our results suggest that strong bars are more likely to be formed by different mechanisms than weak bars. Finally, we find a lower fraction of ultrafast bars than most other studies, which decreases the recently claimed tension with {\Lambda}CDM. However, the median value of R is still lower than what is predicted by simulations. |

|**Abstract**| We present the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public (NGDEEP) Survey, a deep slitless spectroscopic and imaging Cycle 1 JWST treasury survey designed to constrain feedback mechanisms in low-mass galaxies across cosmic time. NGDEEP targets the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) with NIRISS slitless spectroscopy (f~1.2e-18 erg/s/cm^2, 5sigma) to measure metallicities and star-formation rates (SFRs) for low-mass galaxies through the peak of the cosmic SFR density (0.5<z<4). In parallel, NGDEEP targets the HUDF-Par2 parallel field with NIRCam (m=30.6-30.9, 5sigma) to discover galaxies to z>12, constraining the slope of the faint-end of the rest-ultraviolet luminosity function. NGDEEP overlaps with the deepest HST ACS optical imaging in the sky: F435W in the HUDF (m=29.6), and F814W in HUDF-Par2 (m=30), making this a premier HST+JWST Deep Field. As a treasury survey, NGDEEP data is public immediately, and we will rapidly release data products and catalogs in the spirit of previous deep field initiatives. In this paper we present the NGDEEP survey design, summarize the science goals, and detail plans for the public release of NGDEEP reduced data products. |

|**Abstract**| Constraints on the formation and evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy require multi-dimensional measurements of kinematics, abundances, and ages for a large population of stars. Ages for luminous giants, which can be seen to large distances, are an essential component of studies of the Milky Way, but they are traditionally very difficult to estimate precisely for a large dataset and often require careful analysis on a star-by-star basis in asteroseismology. Because spectra are easier to obtain for large samples, being able to determine precise ages from spectra allows for large age samples to be constructed, but spectroscopic ages are often imprecise and contaminated by abundance correlations. Here we present an application of a variational encoder-decoder on cross-domain astronomical data to solve these issues. The model is trained on pairs of stars observed by APOGEE and Kepler in order to reduce the dimensionality of the APOGEE spectra in a latent space while removing abundance information. The low dimensional latent representation of these spectra can then be trained to predict age with just $\sim$ 1,000 precise seismic ages. We demonstrate that this model produces more precise spectroscopic ages ($\sim$ 22% overall, $\sim$ 11% for red-clump stars) than previous data-driven spectroscopic ages while being less contaminated by abundance information (in particular, our ages do not depend on [$\alpha$/M]). We create a public age catalog for the APOGEE DR17 data set and use it to map the age distribution and the age-[Fe/H]-[$\alpha$/M] distribution across the radial range of the Galactic disk. |

|| <mark>Peijin Zhang</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-02-14*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**| Radio spectroscopy provides a unique inspection perspective for solar and space weather research, which can reveal the plasma and energetic electron information in the solar corona and inner heliosphere. However, Radio-Frequency Interference (RFI) from human activities affects sensitive radio telescopes, and significantly affects the quality of observation. Thus, RFI detection and mitigation for the observations is necessary to obtain high quality, science-ready data. The flagging of RFI is particularly challenging for the solar and space weather observations at low frequency, because the solar radio bursts can be brighter than the RFI, and may show similar temporal behavior. In this work, we investigate RFI flagging methods for solar and space weather observations, including a strategy for AOFlagger, and a novel method that makes use of a morphology convolution. These algorithms can effectively flag RFI while preserving solar radio bursts. |

|**Abstract**| The goal of this work is to search for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the Galactic disc at very low latitudes with |b| $<$ 2$^\circ$. For this, we studied the five sources from the VVV near-infrared galaxy catalogue that have also WISE counterparts and present variability in the VIrac VAriable Classification Ensemble (VIVACE) catalogue. In the near-infrared colour-colour diagrams, these objects have in general redder colours compared to the rest of the sources in the field. In the mid-infrared ones, they are located in the AGN region, however there is a source that presents the highest interstellar extinction and different mid-IR colours to be a young stellar object (YSO). We also studied the source variability using two different statistical methods. The fractional variability amplitude $\sigma_{rms}$ ranges from 12.6 to 33.8, being in concordance with previous results found for type-1 AGNs. The slopes of the light curves are in the range (2.6$-$4.7) $\times 10^{-4}$ mag/day, also in agreement with results reported on quasars variability. The combination of all these results suggest that four galaxies are type-1 AGN candidates whereas the fifth source likely a YSO candidate. |

|**Abstract**| In this study, we reported the results of high-resolution (0.14 arcsec) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the 225 GHz dust continuum and CO molecular emission lines from the transitional disk around SY Cha. Our high-resolution observations clearly revealed the inner cavity and the central point source for the first time. The radial profile of the ring can be approximated by a bright narrow ring superimposed on a fainter wide ring. Furthermore, we found that there is a weak azimuthal asymmetry in dust continuum emission. For gas emissions, we detected $\rm{}^{12}CO$(2$-$1), $\rm{}^{13}CO$(2$-$1) and $\rm{}C^{18}O$(2$-$1), from which we estimated the total gas mass of the disk to be $2.2\times10^{-4}M_\odot$, assuming a CO/H$_2$ ratio of $10^{-4}$. The observations showed that the gas is present inside the dust cavity. The analysis of the velocity structure of the $\rm{}^{12}CO$(2$-$1) emission line revealed that the velocity is distorted at the location of the dust inner disk, which may be owing to warping of the disk or radial gas flow within the cavity of the dust disk. High-resolution observations of SY Cha showed that this system is composed of a ring and a distorted inner disk, which may be common, as indicated by the survey of transitional disk systems at a resolution of $\sim$0.1~arcsec. |

|**Abstract**| Aim. The satellite systems of Milky-Way-like galaxies offer a useful means by which to study the galaxy formation process in the cosmological context. It has been suggested that the currently observed anisotropic distribution of the satellites in such galaxy systems is inconsistent with the concordant $\Lambda CDM$ cosmology model on the galactic scale if the observed satellites are random samples of the dark matter (DM) sub-halos that are nearly isotropically distributed around the central galaxy. Here we examine such systems in the context of a simulation of the Local Group. Methods. We use high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of the formation and evolution of Milky-Way-like galaxy systems to investigate the spatial distribution of the luminous satellites and DM sub-halos around the central galaxy. Results. We find that the satellites and DM sub-halos are indeed anisotropically distributed with a direction roughly along the local DM filament. The observed alignment of the satellites in these systems is likely the result of preferred accretion along the local DM filaments in the galaxy formation process. For the dynamical properties of the satellites, we find that the direction of the angular momentum vector of the whole satellite system is different from the normal direction of the fitted "disk of satellites" (DOS) and the normal direction of the velocity dispersion of the system. Hence, the fitted DOS appears to be infalling and is not rotationally supported in this study. |

|**Abstract**| HS 2325+8205 is a long-period eclipsing dwarf nova with an orbital period above the period gap (Porb>3 h) and is reported to be a Z Cam-type dwarf nova. Based on the photometry of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), the light variation and the quasi-periodic oscillation (QPOs) of HS 2325+8205 are studied. Using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP), and sine fitting methods, we find for the first time that there is a QPOs of ~ 2160s in the long outburst top light curves of HS 2325+8205. Moreover, we find that the oscillation intensity of the QPOs of HS 2325+8205 is related to the orbital phase, and the intensity in orbital phases 0.5-0.9 are stronger than in orbital phases 0.1-0.5. Therefore, the relationship between the oscillation intensity of QPOs and the orbital phase may become a research window for the origin of QPOs. In addition, we use the LSP to correct the orbital period of HS 2325+8205 as 0.19433475(6) d. |

|**Abstract**| We present the {\it XMM-Newton} X-ray analysis of 19 X-ray luminous galaxy clusters of low-to-mid redshift ($< 0.4$) selected from the MCXC cluster catalogue in the Hyper Supri%survey as the first work in our series paper. We derive the hydrostatic equilibrium mass and study scaling relations using i) the whole sample, ii) only relaxed clusters and iii) only disturbed clusters. When considering the whole sample, the $Y_{\rm X}$-$M_{\rm tot}$ and $M_{\rm gas}$-$M_{\rm tot}$ relations agree with self-similarity. In terms of morphology, relaxed clusters show a flatter relation in $L_{\rm X,ce}$-$M_{\rm tot}$, $L_{\rm X,bol}$-$M_{\rm tot}$, $L_{\rm X,ce}$-$T$, $L_{\rm bol,ce}$-$T$, $M_{\rm gas}$-$M_{\rm tot}$ and $Y_{\rm X}$-$M_{\rm tot}$. The $L_{\rm bol,ce}$-$M_{\rm tot}$, $L_{\rm X,ce}$-$M_{\rm tot}$ $L_{\rm bol,ce}$-$T$ and $L_{\rm X,ce}$-$T$ relations show a slope $\sim$3$\sigma$ steeper. The residuals in the $M_{\rm gas}$-$M_{\rm tot}$ and $T$-$M_{\rm tot}$ relations and the intrinsic covariance between $M_{\rm gas}$ and $T$ show hints of positive correlation, casting doubt on whether the $Y_{\rm X}$ parameter is a truly low scatter mass proxy. The $M_{\rm gas}$-$M_{\rm tot}$ and $T$-$M_{\rm tot}$ plots color-coded with the offset of the $L_{\rm X,ce}$-$M_{\rm tot}$ relation show these two relations to be brightness dependent but not the $L_{\rm X,ce}$-$T$ relation, suggesting relations involving $M_{\rm tot}$ are biased due to sample selection based on luminosity. Following \citet{2017A&A...606A..24A} and combining our result with literature studies, we find the $M_{\rm tot}$ derived not using mass proxies deviate from $L_{\rm X}$ $\propto$ $M_{\rm gas}^{2}M_{\rm tot}^{-1}$ and $M_{\rm tot}$ based on hydrostatic equilibrium are more massive than what is expected by their relation using caustic masses. This indicates mass bias plays an important role in scaling relations. |

|**Abstract**| The jet composition of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), as well as how efficiently the jet converts its energy to radiation, are long-standing problems in GRB physics. Here, we reported a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of the TeV-emitting bright GRB 190114C. Its high fluence ($\sim$ 4.436$\times$10$^{-4}$ erg cm$^{-2}$) allows us to conduct the time-resolved spectral analysis in great detail and study their variations down to a very short time-scale ($\sim$0.1 s) while preserving a high significance. Its prompt emission consists of three well-separated pulses. The first two main pulses ($P_1$ and $P_2$) exhibit independently strong thermal components, and starting from the third pulse ($P_3$) and extending to the entire afterglow, the spectra are all non-thermal, the synchrotron plus Compton up-scattering model well interpret the observation. By combining the thermal ($P_1$ and $P_2$) and the non-thermal ($P_3$) observations based on two different scenarios (global and pulse properties) and following the method described in \cite{Zhang2021}, we measure the fireball parameters and GRB radiative efficiency with little uncertainties for this GRB. A relevantly high GRB radiative efficiency is obtained based on both the global and pulse properties, suggesting that if GRBs are powered by fireballs, the efficiency can be high sometimes. More interestingly, though the observed parameters are individually different (e.g., the amount of mass loading $M$), the radiative efficiency obtained from $P_1$ ($\eta_\gamma=36.0\pm6.5\%$) and $P_2$ ($\eta_\gamma=41.1\pm1.9\%$) is roughly the same, which implies that the central engine of the same GRB has some common properties. |

|**Abstract**| Dwarf galaxies are characterised by a very low luminosity and low mass. Because of significant accretion and ejection activity of massive black holes, some dwarf galaxies also host low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In a few dwarf AGNs, very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations have found faint non-thermal radio emission. SDSS J090613.77+561015.2 is a dwarf AGN owning an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass of $M_{BH} = 3.6^{+5.9}_{-2.3} \times 10^5 M_{sun}$ and showing a rarely-seen two-component radio structure in its radio nucleus. To further probe their nature, i.e. the IMBH jet activity, we performed additional deep observations with the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 1.66 GHz and 4.99 GHz. We find the more diffuse emission regions and structure details. These new EVN imaging results allow us to reveal a two-sided jet morphology with a size up to about 150 mas (projected length $\sim$140 pc) and a radio luminosity of about $3\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The peak feature has an optically thin radio spectrum and thus more likely represents a relatively young ejecta instead of a jet base. The EVN study on SDSS J090613.77+561015.2 demonstrates the existence of episodic, relatively large-scale and powerful IMBH jet activity in dwarf AGNs. Moreover, we collected a small sample of VLBI-detected dwarf AGNs and investigated their connections with normal AGNs. We notice that these radio sources in the dwarf AGNs tend to have steep spectra and small linear sizes, and possibly represent ejecta from scaled-down episodic jet activity. |

|**Abstract**| GRB 221009A is the brightest Gamma-Ray Burst detected in more than 50 years of study. Here, we present observations in the X-ray and optical domains ranging from the prompt emission (optical coverage by all-sky cameras) up to 20 days after the GRB obtained by the GRANDMA Collaboration (which includes observations from more than 30 professional and amateur telescopes) and the \textit{Insight}-HXMT Collaboration operating the X-ray telescope HXMT-LE. We study the optical afterglow both with empirical fitting procedures and numerical modeling. We find that the GRB afterglow, extinguished by a large dust column, is most likely behind a combination of a large Milky-Way dust column combined with moderate low-metallicity dust in the host galaxy. We find that numerical models describing the synchrotron radiation at the forward shock of a relativistic top-hat jet propagating through a constant density medium require extreme parameters to fit the observational data. Based on these observations, we constrain the isotropic afterglow energy $E_{0} \sim 3.7 \times 10^{54}$ erg, the density of the ambient medium $n_{\mathrm{ism}} \gtrsim 1~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and the opening angle of the jet core to be $\gtrsim10.7^\circ$. We do not find evidence (for or against) of jet structure, a potential jet break and the presence or absence of a SN. Placed in the global context of GRB optical afterglows, we find the afterglow of GRB 221009A is luminous but not extraordinarily so, highlighting that some aspects of this GRB do not deviate from the known sample despite its extreme energetics and the peculiar afterglow evolution. |

|**Abstract**| The three-dimensional extinction and structure are studied for the Taurus, Orion, Perseus and California molecular clouds based on the LAMOST spectroscopy. Stellar color excess is calculated with the intrinsic color index derived from the atmospheric parameters in the LAMOST DR8 catalog and the observed color index in the Gaia EDR3 and the 2MASS PSC. In combination with the distance from the Gaia EDR3 parallax, the three-dimensional dust extinction maps are retrieved in the color excesses $E_{\rm{G_{BP},G_{RP}}}$ and $E_{\rm{J,K_{S}}}$ with an uncertainty of $\sim$0.03mag and $\sim$0.07mag respectively. The extinction maps successfully separate the clouds that overlap in the sky area and manifest the structure of the individual cloud. Meanwhile, a bow-like structure is found with a distance range from 175pc to 250pc, half of which is a part of the Per-Tau Shell in similar coordinates and distance while the other half is not. Three low-extinction rings are additionally discovered and briefly discussed. |

|**Abstract**| Photonic Integrated Circuits (PIC) are best known for their important role in the telecommunication sector, e.g. high speed communication devices in data centers. However, PIC also hold the promise for innovation in sectors like life science, medicine, sensing, automotive etc. The past two decades have seen efforts of utilizing PIC to enhance the performance of instrumentation for astronomical telescopes, perhaps the most spectacular example being the integrated optics beam combiner for the interferometer GRAVITY at the ESO Very Large Telescope. This instrument has enabled observations of the supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way at unprecedented angular resolution, eventually leading to the Nobel Price for Physics in 2020. Several groups worldwide are actively engaged in the emerging field of astrophotonics research, amongst them the innoFSPEC Center in Potsdam, Germany. We present results for a number of applications developed at innoFSPEC, notably PIC for integrated photonic spectrographs on the basis of arrayed waveguide gratings and the PAWS demonstrator (Potsdam Arrayed Waveguide Spectrograph), PIC-based ring resonators in astronomical frequency combs for precision wavelength calibration, discrete beam combiners (DBC) for large astronomical interferometers, as well as aperiodic fiber Bragg gratings for complex astronomical filters and their possible derivatives in PIC. |

|**Abstract**| Recent anisotropy studies of UHECR data at energies $\gtrsim$ 40 EeV, have disclosed a correlation of their angular distribution with the extragalactic local structure, specifically with either local starburst galaxies or AGN. Using Monte Carlo simulations taking into account photo-disintegration processes, we further explore a framework in which these UHECRs were accelerated by Centaurus A in a recent powerful outburst before being scattered by magnetic fields associated with local, Council of Giant, extragalactic structure. We find that the observed intermediate scale anisotropies can be accounted for by the Council of Giant structure imposing a response function on the initial outburst of UHECRs from a single source located at Centaurus A's position. The presence of these local structures create `echoes' of UHECRs after the initial impulse, and focusing effects. The strongest echo wave has a lag of $\sim$ 20 Myr, comparable to the age of synchrotron-emitting electrons in the giant Centaurus A lobes. Through consideration of the composition of both the direct and echo wave components, we find that the distribution of the light (1$<\ln A<$1.5) component across the sky offers exciting prospects for testing the echo model using future facilities such as Auger prime. Our results demonstrate the potential that UHECR nuclei offer, as "composition clocks", for probing propagation scenarios from local sources. |

|**Abstract**| We generate a model description of the solar wind based on an explicit wave-turbulence-driven heating mechanism, and constrain our model with observational data. We included an explicit coronal heating source term in the general 3D magnetohydrodynamic code NIRVANA to simulate the properties of the solar wind. The adapted heating mechanism is based on the interaction and subsequent dissipation of counter-propagating Alfv\'en waves in the solar corona, accounting for a turbulent heating rate Q_p. The solar magnetic field is assumed to be an axisymmetric dipole with a field strength of 1 G. Our model results are validated against observational data taken by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). Our NIRwave solar wind model reconstructs the bimodal structure of the solar wind with slow and fast wind speeds of 410 km/s and 650 km/s respectively. The global mass-loss rate of our solar wind model is 2.6e-14 solar masses per year. Despite implementing simplified conditions to represent the solar magnetic field, the solar wind parameters characterising our steady-state solution are in reasonable agreement with previously established results and empirical constraints. The number density from our wind solution is in good agreement with the derived empirical constraints, with larger deviations for the radial velocity and temperature. In a comparison to a polytropic wind model generated with NIRVANA, we find that our NIRwave model is in better agreement with the observational constraints that we derive. |

|*Appeared on*| *2023-02-14*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal*|
|**Abstract**| The concept of surface-flux transport (SFT) is commonly used in evolving models of the large-scale solar surface magnetic field. These photospheric models are used to determine the large-scale structure of the overlying coronal magnetic field, as well as to make predictions about the fields and flows that structure the solar wind. We compare predictions from two SFT models for the solar wind, open magnetic field footpoints, and the presence of coronal magnetic null points throughout various phases of a solar activity cycle, focusing on the months of April in even-numbered years between 2012 and 2020, inclusive. We find that there is a solar cycle dependence to each of the metrics considered, but there is not a single phase of the cycle in which all the metrics indicate good agreement between the models. The metrics also reveal large, transient differences between the models when a new active region is rotating into the assimilation window. The evolution of the surface flux is governed by a combination of large scale flows and comparatively small scale motions associated with convection. Because the latter flows evolve rapidly, there are intervals during which their impact on the surface flux can only be characterized in a statistical sense, thus their impact is modeled by introducing a random evolution that reproduces the typical surface flux evolution. We find that the differences between the predicted properties are dominated by differences in the model assumptions and implementation, rather than selection of a particular realization of the random evolution. |

|**Abstract**| Inner regions of protoplanetary disks host many complex physical processes such as star-disk interactions, magnetic fields, planet formation, and the migration of new planets. To directly study this region requires milli-arcsecond angular resolution, beyond the diffraction limit of the world's largest optical telescopes and even too small for the mm-wave interferometer ALMA. However, we can use infrared interferometers to image the inner astronomical unit. Here, we present new results from the CHARA and VLTI arrays for the young and luminous Herbig Be star HD 190073. We detect a sub-AU cavity surrounded by a ring-like structure that we interpret as the dust destruction front. We model the shape with 6 radial profiles, 3 symmetric and 3 asymmetric, and present a model-free image reconstruction. All the models are consistent with a near face-on disk with inclination $\lesssim 20^\circ$, and we measure an average ring radius of 1.4 $\pm 0.2$ mas (1.14 AU). Around $48\%$ of the total flux comes from the disk with ~$15\%$ of that emission appearing to emerge from inside the inner rim. The cause of emission is still unclear, perhaps due to different dust grain compositions or gas emission. The skewed models and the imaging point to an off-center star, possibly due to binarity. Our image shows a sub-AU structure, which seems to move between the two epochs inconsistently with Keplerian motion and we discuss possible explanations for this apparent change. |

|**Abstract**| We have investigated the impact of circumplanetary rings consisting of spherical micrometer-sized particles on the net scattered light polarization of extrasolar gas giants. Using the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code POLARIS, we studied the impact of the macroscopic parameters that define the ring, such as its radius and inclination, and the chemical composition of the ring particles on the net scattered polarization. For the spherical ring particles, we applied the Mie scattering theory. We studied the flux and polarization of the scattered stellar radiation as a function of planetary phase angle and wavelength from the optical to the near-infrared. For the chosen grain size distribution, the dust particles in the ring show strong forward scattering at the considered wavelengths. Thus, the reflected flux of the planet dominates the total reflected and polarized flux at small phase angles. However, the scattered and polarized flux of the ring increase at large phase angles and exceeds the total reflected planetary flux. For large rings that contain silicate particles, the total reflected flux is dominated by the radiation scattered by the dust in the ring at all phase angles. As a result, the orientation of polarization is parallel to the scattering plane at small phase angles. In contrast, for a ring that contains water ice particles, the orientation of polarization is parallel to the scattering plane at large phase angles. Depending on the ring inclination and orientation, the total reflected and polarized flux show a specific distribution as well. Large particles show a strong polarization at large phase angles compared to smaller particles. For a Jupiter-like atmosphere that contains methane and aerosols, methane absorption features are missing in the spectrum of a ringed planet. |

|*Comments*| *6 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables. Contribution to: 2nd Electronic Conference on Universe*|
|**Abstract**| Single field inflationary models are investigated within Palatini quadratic gravity represented by $R+\alpha R^2$ along with a non-minimal coupling of the form $f(\phi) R$ between the inflaton field $\phi$ and the gravity. The treatment is performed in the Einstein frame, where the minimal coupling to gravity is recovered through conformal transformation. We consider various limits of the model with different inflationary scenarios characterized as canonical slow-roll inflation in the limit $\alpha \dot{\phi}^2\ll (1+f(\phi)) $, constant-roll k-inflation for $\alpha \ll 1$, and slow-roll K-inflation for$ \alpha \gg 1$ . A cosine and exponential potential are examined with the limits mentioned above and different well-motivated non-minimal couplings to gravity. We compare the theoretical results, exemplified by the tensor-to-scalar $r$ ratio and spectral index $n_s$, with the recent observational results of Planck 2018 $\&$ BICEP/Keck . Furthermore, we include the results of a new study forecast precision with which $n_s$ and $r$ can be constrained by currently envisaged observations, including CMB (Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, and LiteBIRD) |

|**Abstract**| The distribution of the spin directions of spiral galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey has been a topic of debate in the past two decades, with conflicting conclusions reported even in cases where the same data was used. Here we follow one of the previous experiments by applying the SpArcFiRe algorithm to annotate the spin directions in original dataset of Galaxy Zoo 1. The annotation of the galaxy spin directions is done after a first step of selecting the spiral galaxies in three different manners: manual analysis by Galaxy Zoo classifications, by a model-driven computer analysis, and with no selection of spiral galaxies. The results show that when spiral galaxies are selected by Galaxy Zoo volunteers, the distribution of their spin directions as determined by SpArcFiRe is not random, which agrees with previous reports. When selecting the spiral galaxies using a model-driven computer analysis or without selecting the spiral galaxies at all, the distribution is also not random. Simple binomial distribution analysis shows that the probability of the parity violation to occur by chance is lower than 0.01. Fitting the spin directions as observed from Earth to cosine dependence exhibits a dipole axis with statistical strength of 2.33$\sigma$ to 3.97$\sigma$. These experiments show that regardless of the selection mechanism and the analysis method, all experiments show similar conclusions. These results are aligned with previous reports using other methods and telescopes, suggesting that the spin directions of spiral galaxies as observed from Earth exhibit a dipole axis formed by their spin directions. Possible explanations can be related to the large-scale structure of the Universe, or to internal structure of galaxies. The catalogs of annotated galaxies generated as part of this study are available. |

|**Abstract**| In this chapter we examine how our knowledge of present day Venus can inform terrestrial exoplanetary science and how exoplanetary science can inform our study of Venus. In a superficial way the contrasts in knowledge appear stark. We have been looking at Venus for millennia and studying it via telescopic observations for centuries. Spacecraft observations began with Mariner 2 in 1962 when we confirmed that Venus was a hothouse planet, rather than the tropical paradise science fiction pictured. As long as our level of exploration and understanding of Venus remains far below that of Mars, major questions will endure. On the other hand, exoplanetary science has grown leaps and bounds since the discovery of Pegasus 51b in 1995, not too long after the golden years of Venus spacecraft missions came to an end with the Magellan Mission in 1994. Multi-million to billion dollar/euro exoplanet focused spacecraft missions such as JWST, and its successors will be flown in the coming decades. At the same time, excitement about Venus exploration is blooming again with a number of confirmed and proposed missions in the coming decades from India, Russia, Japan, the European Space Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. In this chapter, we review what is known and what we may discover tomorrow in complementary studies of Venus and its exoplanetary cousins. |

|**Abstract**| We systematically inspect the microlensing data acquired by the KMTNet survey during the previous seasons in order to find anomalous lensing events for which the anomalies in the lensing light curves cannot be explained by the usual binary-lens or binary-source interpretations. From the inspection, we find that interpreting the three lensing events OGLE-2018-BLG-0584, KMT-2018-BLG-2119, and KMT-2021-BLG-1122 requires four-body (lens+source) models, in which either both the lens and source are binaries (2L2S event) or the lens is a triple system (3L1S event). Following the analyses of the 2L2S events presented in \citet{Han2023}, here we present the 3L1S analysis of the KMT-2021-BLG-1122. It is found that the lens of the event KMT-2021-BLG-1122 is composed of three masses, in which the projected separations (normalized to the angular Einstein radius) and mass ratios between the lens companions and the primary are $(s_2, q_2)\sim (1.4, 0.53)$ and $(s_3, q_3) \sim (1.6, 0.24)$. By conducting a Bayesian analysis, we estimate that the masses of the individual lens components are $(M_1, M_2, M_3)\sim (0.47\,M_\odot, 0.24\,M_\odot, 0.11\,M_\odot)$. The companions are separated in projection from the primary by $(a_{\perp,2}, a_{\perp,3})\sim (3.5, 4.0)$~AU. The lens of KMT-2018-BLG-2119 is the first triple stellar system detected via microlensing. |

|**Abstract**| Interstellar dust captures a significant fraction of elements heavier than helium in the solid state and is an indispensable component both in theory and observations of galaxy evolution. Dust emission is generally the primary coolant of the interstellar medium (ISM) and facilitates the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of gas clouds from which stars form, while altering the emission spectrum of galaxies from ultraviolet (UV) to far-infrared wavelengths through the reprocessing of starlight. However, the astrophysical origin of various types of dust grains remains an open question, especially in the early Universe. Here we report direct evidence for the presence of carbonaceous grains from the detection of the broad UV absorption feature around $2175 \, \mathring{\rm A}$ in deep near-infrared spectra of galaxies up to the first billion years of cosmic time, at a redshift ($z$) of $\sim 7$. This dust attenuation feature has previously only been observed spectroscopically in older, more evolved galaxies at redshifts of $z < 3$. The carbonaceous grains giving rise to this feature are often thought to be produced on timescales of hundreds of millions of years by asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Our results suggest a more rapid production scenario, likely in supernova (SN) ejecta. |

|**Abstract**| This article presents the early results of synchronous multiwavelength observations of one of the brightest gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) GRB 160625B with the detailed continuous fast optical photometry of its optical counterpart obtained by MASTER and with hard X-ray and gamma-ray emission, obtained by the Lomonosov and Konus-Wind spacecraft. The detailed photometry led us to detect the quasi-periodical emission components in the intrinsic optical emission. As a result of our analysis of synchronous multiwavelength observations, we propose a three-stage collapse scenario for this long and bright GRB. We suggest that quasiperiodic fluctuations may be associated with forced precession of a self-gravitating rapidly rotating superdense body (spinar), whose evolution is determined by a powerful magnetic field. The spinar's mass allows it to collapse into a black hole at the end of evolution. |

|**Abstract**| We report on MASTER optical observations of an afterglow-like optical and X-ray transient AT2021lfa/ZTF21aayokph. We detected the initial steady brightening of the transient at 7{\sigma} confidence level. This allowed us to use smooth optical self-similar emission of GRBs model to constrain the explosion time to better than 14 min as well as to estimate its initial Lorentz factor {\Gamma}0 = 20 +/- 10. Taking into consideration the low {\Gamma}0 and non-detection in gamma-rays, we classify this transient as the first failed GRB afterglow. |
