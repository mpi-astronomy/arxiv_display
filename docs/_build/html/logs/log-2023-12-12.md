|**Abstract**| We present high-precision radial velocity (RV) observations of Gaia BH1, the nearest known black hole (BH). The system contains a solar-type G star orbiting a massive dark companion, which could be either a single BH or an inner BH + BH binary. A BH + BH binary is expected in some models where Gaia BH1 formed as a hierarchical triple, which are attractive because they avoid many of the difficulties associated with forming the system through isolated binary evolution. Our observations test the inner binary scenario. We have measured 115 precise RVs of the G star, including 40 from ESPRESSO with a precision of $3$-$5$ m s$^{-1}$, and 75 from other instruments with a typical precision of $30$-$100$ m s$^{-1}$. Our observations span $2.33$ orbits of the G star and are concentrated near a periastron passage, when perturbations due to an inner binary would be largest. The RVs are well-fit by a Keplerian two-body orbit and show no convincing evidence of an inner binary. Using REBOUND simulations of hierarchical triples with a range of inner periods, mass ratios, eccentricities, and orientations, we show that plausible inner binaries with periods $P_{\text{inner}} \gtrsim 1.5$ days would have produced larger deviations from a Keplerian orbit than observed. Binaries with $P_{\text{inner}} \lesssim 1.5$ days are consistent with the data, but these would merge within a Hubble time and would thus imply fine-tuning. We present updated parameters of Gaia BH1's orbit. The RVs yield a spectroscopic mass function $f\left(M_{\text{BH}}\right)=3.9358 \pm 0.0002\,M_{\odot}$ - about $7000\sigma$ above the $\sim2.5\,M_{\odot}$ maximum neutron star mass. Including the inclination constraint from Gaia astrometry, this implies a BH mass of $M_{\text{BH}} = 9.27 \pm 0.10 ~ M_{\odot}$. |

|**Abstract**| We present the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS)-AstroSat atlas, which contains ultraviolet imaging of 31 nearby star-forming galaxies captured by the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on the AstroSat satellite. The atlas provides a homogeneous data set of far- and near-ultraviolet maps of galaxies within a distance of 22 Mpc and a median angular resolution of 1.4 arcseconds (corresponding to a physical scale between 25 and 160 pc). After subtracting a uniform ultraviolet background and accounting for Milky Way extinction, we compare our estimated flux densities to GALEX observations, finding good agreement. We find candidate extended UV disks around the galaxies NGC 6744 and IC 5332. We present the first statistical measurements of the clumping of the UV emission and compare it to the clumping of molecular gas traced with ALMA. We find that bars and spiral arms exhibit the highest degree of clumping, and the molecular gas is even more clumped than the FUV emission in galaxies. We investigate the variation of the ratio of observed FUV to H$\alpha$ in different galactic environments and kpc-sized apertures. We report that $\sim 65 \%$ varation of the $\log_{10}$(FUV/H$\alpha$) can be described through a combination of dust attenuation with star formation history parameters. The PHANGS-AstroSat atlas enhances the multi-wavelength coverage of our sample, offering a detailed perspective on star formation. When integrated with PHANGS data sets from ALMA, VLT-MUSE, HST and JWST, it develops our comprehensive understanding of attenuation curves and dust attenuation in star-forming galaxies. |

|**Abstract**| We report near-infrared long-baseline interferometric observations of the Hyades multiple system HD 284163, made with the CHARA array, as well as almost 43 yr of high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring at the CfA. Both types of observations resolve the 2.39 d inner binary, and also an outer companion in a 43.1 yr orbit. Our observations, combined with others from the literature, allow us to solve for the 3D inner and outer orbits, which are found to be at nearly right angles to each other. We determine the dynamical masses of the three stars (good to better than 1.4% for the inner pair), as well as the orbital parallax. The secondary component (0.5245 +/- 0.0047 MSun) is now the lowest mass star with a dynamical mass measurement in the cluster. A comparison of these measurements with current stellar evolution models for the age and metallicity of the Hyades shows good agreement. All three stars display significant levels of chromospheric activity, consistent with the classification of HD 284163 as an RS CVn object. We present evidence that a more distant fourth star is physically associated, making this a hierarchical quadruple system. |

|| D. Zhou, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |

|**Abstract**| Globular clusters harbor numerous millisecond pulsars; however, the detection of long-period pulsars within these clusters has been notably scarce. The search for long-period pulsars encounters significant challenges due to pronounced red noise interference, necessitating the crucial step of red noise removal in the data preprocessing. In this study, we use running median filtering to mitigate red noise in multiple globular cluster datasets obtained through observations with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Additionally, we estimated the minimum detectable flux density of pulsars ($S_{\rm min}$) considering this processing step, resulting in a function depicting how $S_{\rm min}$ varies with different duty cycles and periods. Subsequently, a systematic search for long-period pulsars was conducted on the globular cluster datasets after red noise elimination. Ultimately, two isolated long-period pulsars were discovered in the M15 globular cluster, with periods of approximately 1.928451 seconds and 3.960716 seconds, both exhibiting remarkably low pulse duty cycles of around 1\%. Using archived data, we obtained timing solutions for these pulsars. Based on the timing results, their positions are found to be close to the center of the M15 cluster. On the $P-\dot{P}$ diagram, they both lie below the spin-up line, suggesting that their recycling process was likely interrupted, leading them to become isolated pulsars. Moreover, in our current search, these very faint long-period pulsars are exclusively identified in M15, and one possible reason for this could be the relatively close proximity and extremely high stellar formation rate of M15. As observational data accumulate and search algorithms undergo iterative enhancements, the prospect of discovering additional long-period pulsars within globular clusters, such as M15, becomes increasingly promising. |

|**Abstract**| We present the discovery of three pulsars in Globular Cluster M15 (NGC 7078) by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). In the three pulsars, PSR~J2129+1210J (M15J) is a millisecond pulsar with a spinning period of 11.84 ms and a dispersion measure of 66.68 pc cm$^{-3}$. Both PSR~J2129+1210K and L (M15K and L) are long period pulsars with spinning periods of 1928 ms and 3961 ms , respectively, while M15L is the GC pulsar with the longest spinning period till now. The discoveries of M15K and L support the theory that core-collapsed Globular Clusters may contain partially recycled long period pulsars. With the same dataset, the timing solutions of M15A to H were updated, and the timing parameter P1 of M15F is different from the previous results, which is approximately 0.027$\times 10^{-18} ss^{-1}$ from our work and $0.032 \times 10^{-18} ss^{-1}$ from Anderson's\citep{anderson-1993}. As predicted by Rodolfi et al. , the luminosity of M15C kept decreasing and the latest detection in our dataset is on December 20$^{\rm th}$, 2022. We also detected M15I for one more time. The different barycentric spin periods indicate that this pulsar should locate in a binary system, manifesting itself as the exceptional one in such a core-collapsing GC. |

|**Abstract**| Carbon stars are excellent kinematic tracers of galaxies and play important roles in understanding the evolution of the Galaxy. Therefore, it is worthwhile to search for them in a large amount of spectra. In this work, we build a new carbon star catalog based on the LAMOST DR7 spectra. The catalog contains 4542 spectra of 3546 carbon stars, identified through line index and near-infrared color-color diagrams. Through visual inspection of the spectra, we further subclassify them into 925 C--H, 384 C--R, 608 C--N, and 1292 Ba stars. However, 437 stars could not be sub-classified due to their low signal-to-noise. Moreover, by comparing with LAMOST DR7 pipeline we find 567 more carbon stars and visually sub-classify them. We find that on the $J-H$ vs. $H-K_{\rm s}$ two-color diagram, C--N stars can be reliably distinguished from the other three sub-types. Additionally, by utilizing the Gaia distance, we study the distribution of carbon stars in the H-R diagram and identify 258 dwarf carbon stars by the criterion $M_{\rm G}>$5.0\,mag. Finally, we present the spatial distribution in Galactic coordinates of the 3546 carbon stars. The majority of C-N, C-R, and Ba stars are distributed at low Galactic latitudes, while most C--H and dC stars distribute at high Galactic latitudes. |
