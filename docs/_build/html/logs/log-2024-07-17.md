|| <mark>S. Ghosh</mark>, P. Bhat |

|**Abstract**|            Observations of galaxy clusters show radio emission extended over almost the system scale, necessitating mechanisms for particle acceleration. Previous models for acceleration such as diffusive shock acceleration and that due to turbulence fall short in terms of efficiency. In this letter, we propose the possibility of acceleration via magnetic reconnection. In particular, we invoke the plasmoid instability which has been previously applied to understand particle energization in high energy systems. Turbulence in galaxy clusters lead to fluctuation dynamos that are known to generate magnetic fields structures consisting of sharp reversals. These form natural sites of reconnection. We perform Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations of the plasmoid instability in collisionless and nonrelativistic plasmas. We show that the resulting particle energy spectra have power law indices that are consistent with that inferred from observations. Our estimates of the maximum achievable Lorentz factor is about $10^5$ indicating that acceleration due magnetic reconnection is a promising avenue for understanding the origin of nonthermal emission in galaxy clusters.         |

|**Abstract**|            Current radio interferometers output multi-petabyte-scale volumes of data per year making the storage, transfer, and processing of this data a sizeable challenge. This challenge is expected to grow with the next-generation telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array. Lossy compression of interferometric data post-correlation can abate this challenge. However, since high-redshift 21-cm studies impose strict precision requirements, the impact of such lossy data compression on the 21-cm signal power spectrum statistic should be understood. We apply Dysco visibility compression, a technique to normalize and quantize specifically designed for radio interferometric data. We establish the level of the compression noise in the power spectrum in comparison to the thermal noise as well as its coherency behavior. Finally, for optimal compression results, we compare the compression noise obtained from different compression settings to a nominal 21-cm signal power. From a single night of observation, we find that the noise introduced due to the compression is more than five orders of magnitude lower than the thermal noise level in the power spectrum. The noise does not affect calibration. The compression noise shows no correlation with the sky signal and has no measurable coherent component. The level of compression error in the power spectrum ultimately depends on the compression settings. Dysco visibility compression is found to be of insignificant concern for 21-cm power spectrum studies. Hence, data volumes can be safely reduced by factors of $\sim 4$ and with insignificant bias to the final power spectrum. Data from SKA-low will likely be compressible by the same factor as LOFAR, owing to the similarities of the two instruments. The same technique can be used to compress data from other telescopes, but a small adjustment of the compression parameters might be required.         |

|| X.-J. Xie, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Shi</mark>, <mark>R. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-07-17*|
|*Comments*| *5 figures, 3 tables*|
|**Abstract**|            Highly r-process-enhanced stars are rare and usually metal-poor ([Fe/H] < - 1.0), and mainly populate the Milky Way halo and dwarf galaxies. This study presents the discovery of a relatively bright (V = 12.72), highly r-process-enhanced (r-II) star ([Eu/Fe] = +1.32, [Ba/Eu] = - 0.95), LAMOST J020623.21 + 494127.9. This star was selected from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) medium-resolution (R ~ 7500) spectroscopic survey; follow-up high-resolution (R ~ 25,000) observations were conducted with the High Optical Resolution Spectrograph (HORuS) installed on the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). The stellar parameters (${T_{\rm eff}}$ = 4130 K, $\rm log\,g $ = 1.52, $ \rm[Fe/H] $ = $ - $0.54, $\xi$ = 1.80 $ \rm{km\,{s^{-1}}} $) have been inferred taking into account non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects. The abundances of [Ce/Fe], [Pr/Fe], and [Nd/Fe] are +0.19, +0.65 and +0.64, respectively, relatively low compared to the Solar r-process pattern normalized to Eu. This star has a high metallicity ([Fe/H] = - 0.54) compared to most other highly r-process-enhanced stars, and has the highest measured abundance ratio of Eu to H ([Eu/H] = +0.78). It is classified as a thin-disk star based on its kinematics, and does not appear to belong to any known stream or dwarf galaxy.         |

|| <mark>R. Zhang</mark>, et al. |

|**Abstract**|            We performed closed-loop lab testing of large-format deformable mirrors (DMs) with hybrid variable reluctance actuators. TNO has been developing the hybrid variable reluctance actuators in support for a new generation of adaptive secondary mirrors (ASMs), which aim to be more robust and reliable. Compared to the voice coil actuators, this new actuator technology has a higher current to force efficiency, and thus can support DMs with thicker facesheets. Before putting this new technology on-sky, it is necessary to understand how to control it and how it behaves in closed-loop. We performed closed-loop tests with the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor with three large-format deformable mirrors that use the TNO actuators: DM3, FLASH, and IRTF-ASM-1 ASM. The wavefront sensor and the real-time control systems were developed for the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) and the UH 2.2-meter telescope ASMs. We tested IRTF-ASM-1 on-sky and proved that it meets all of our performance requirements. This work presents our lab setup for the experiments, the techniques we have employed to drive these new ASMs, the results of our closed-loop lab tests for FLASH and IRTF-ASM-1, and the on-sky closed-loop results of IRTF-ASM-1 ASM.         |

|**Abstract**|            GJ 581 is a nearby M dwarf known to host a packed multiple planet system with 2 super-Earths and a Neptune-mass planet. We present new orbital analyses of the system, utilizing recent RV data obtained from the CARMENES spectrograph combined with newly reprocessed archival data from the HARPS and HIRES spectrographs. Our aim was to analyze the post-discovery spectroscopic data of GJ 581, which were obtained with CARMENES. In addition, we used publicly available HIRES and HARPS spectroscopic data to seek evidence of the known and disputed exoplanets in this system. We aimed to investigate the stellar activity of GJ 581 and update the planetary system's orbital parameters using state-of-the-art numerical models and techniques. We performed a periodogram analysis of the available precise CARMENES, HIRES, and HARPS RVs and of stellar activity indicators. We conducted detailed orbital analyses by testing various orbital configurations consistent with the RV data. We studied the posterior probability distribution of the parameters fit to the data and explored the long-term stability and overall orbital dynamics of the system. We refined the orbital parameters of the system using the most precise and complete set of Doppler data available. Consistent with the existing literature, we confirm that the system is unequivocally composed of only 3 planets detectable in the present data, dismissing the putative planet GJ 581 d as an artifact of stellar activity. Our N-body fit reveals that the system's inclination is i $=$ 47.0 deg, which implies that the planets could be up to 30% more massive than their previously reported minimum masses. Furthermore, we report that the system exhibits long-term stability, as indicated by the posterior probability distribution, characterized by secular dynamical interactions without the involvement of mean motion resonances.         |
