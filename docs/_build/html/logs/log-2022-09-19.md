|**Abstract**| Over the last years, large (sub-)millimetre surveys of protoplanetary disks have well constrained the demographics of disks, such as their millimetre luminosities, spectral indices, and disk radii. Additionally, several high-resolution observations have revealed an abundance of substructures in the disks dust continuum. The most prominent are ring like structures, likely due to pressure bumps trapping dust particles. The origins and characteristics of these bumps, nevertheless, need to be further investigated. The purpose of this work is to study how dynamic pressure bumps affect observational properties of protoplanetary disks. We further aim to differentiate between the planetary- versus zonal flow-origin of pressure bumps. We perform one-dimensional gas and dust evolution simulations, setting up models with varying pressure bump features. We subsequently run radiative transfer calculations to obtain synthetic images and the different quantities of observations. We find that the outermost pressure bump determines the disks dust size across different millimetre wavelengths. Our modelled dust traps need to form early (< 0.1 Myr), fast (on viscous timescales), and must be long lived (> Myr) to obtain the observed high millimetre luminosities and low spectral indices of disks. While the planetary bump models can reproduce these observables irrespectively of the opacity prescription, the highest opacities are needed for the zonal flow bump model to be in line with observations. Our findings favour the planetary- over the zonal flow-origin of pressure bumps and support the idea that planet formation already occurs in early class 0-1 stages of circumstellar disks. The determination of the disks effective size through its outermost pressure bump also delivers a possible answer to why disks in recent low-resolution surveys appear to have the same sizes across different millimetre wavelengths. |

|**Abstract**| Stellar kinematics and metallicity are key to exploring formation scenarios for galactic disks and halos. In this work, we characterized the relationship between kinematics and photometric metallicity along the line-of-sight to M31's disk. We combined optical HST/ACS photometry from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey with Keck/DEIMOS spectra from the Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo (SPLASH) survey. The resulting sample of 3536 individual red giant branch stars spans 4-19 projected kpc, making it a useful probe of both the disk and inner halo. We separated these stars into disk and halo populations by modeling the line-of-sight velocity distributions as a function of position across the disk region, where 70.9% stars have a high likelihood of belonging to the disk and 17.1% to the halo. Although stellar halos are typically thought to be metal-poor, the kinematically identified halo contains a significant population of stars (29.4%) with disk-like metallicity ([Fe/H]$_{\rm phot} \sim -0.10$). This metal-rich halo population lags the gaseous disk to a similar extent as the rest of the halo, indicating that it does not correspond to a canonical thick disk. Its properties are inconsistent with those of tidal debris originating from the Giant Stellar Stream merger event. Moreover, the halo is chemically distinct from the phase-mixed component previously identified along the minor axis (i.e., away from the disk), implying contributions from different formation channels. These metal-rich halo stars provide direct chemodynamical evidence in favor of the previously suggested "kicked-up'' disk population in M31's inner stellar halo. |

|**Abstract**| Stars that interact with supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can either be completely or partially destroyed by tides. In a partial tidal disruption event (TDE) the high-density core of the star remains intact, and the low-density, outer envelope of the star is stripped and feeds a luminous accretion episode. The TDE AT2018fyk, with an inferred black hole mass of $10^{7.7\pm0.4}$ M$_{\odot}$, experienced an extreme dimming event at X-ray (factor of $>$6000) and UV (factor $\sim$15) wavelengths $\sim$500--600 days after discovery. Here we report on the re-emergence of these emission components roughly 1200 days after discovery. We find that the source properties are similar to those of the pre-dimming accretion state, suggesting that the accretion flow was rejuvenated to a similar state. We propose that a repeating partial TDE, where the partially disrupted star is on a $\sim 600$ day orbit about the SMBH and is periodically stripped of mass during each pericenter passage, powers its unique lightcurve. This scenario provides a plausible explanation for AT2018fyk's overall properties, including the rapid dimming event and the rebrightening at late times. We also provide testable predictions for the behavior of the accretion flow in the future: if the second encounter was also a partial disruption then we predict another strong dimming event around day 1800 (August 2023), and a subsequent rebrightening around day 2400 (March 2025). This source provides strong evidence of the partial disruption of a star by a SMBH. |

|| Jose A. Benavides, et al. -- incl., <mark>Lars Hernquist</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2022-09-19*|

|**Abstract**| We study the formation of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) using the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 of the Illustris-TNG suite. We define UDGs as dwarf galaxies in the stellar mass range $\rm{7.5 \leq log (M_{\star} / M_{\odot}) \leq 9 }$ that are in the $5\%$ most extended tail of the simulated mass-size relation. This results in a sample of UDGs with half-mass radii $\rm{r_{h \star } \gtrsim 2 \ kpc}$ and surface brightness between $\rm{24.5}$ and $\rm{28 \ mag \ arcsec^{-2}}$, similar to definitions of UDGs in observations. The large cosmological volume in TNG50 allows for a comparison of UDGs properties in different environments, from the field to galaxy clusters with virial mass $\rm{M_{200} \sim 2 \times 10^{14} ~ M_{\odot}}$. All UDGs in our sample have dwarf-mass haloes ($\rm{M_{200}\sim 10^{11} ~ M_{\odot} }$) and show the same environmental trends as normal dwarfs: field UDGs are star-forming and blue while satellite UDGs are typically quiescent and red. The TNG50 simulation predicts UDGs that populate preferentially higher spin haloes and more massive haloes at fixed $\rm{M_{\star}}$ compared to non-UDG dwarfs. This applies also to most satellite UDGs, which are actually ``born" UDGs in the field and infall into groups and clusters without significant changes to their size. We find, however, a small subset of satellite UDGs ($\lesssim 10 \%$) with present-day stellar size a factor $\geq 1.5$ larger than at infall, confirming that tidal effects, particularly in the lower mass dwarfs, are also a viable formation mechanism for some of these dwarfs, although subdominant in this simulation. |

|| Yinzi Xin, et al. -- incl., <mark>Jonathan Lin</mark> |

|**Abstract**| Coronagraphs allow for faint off-axis exoplanets to be observed, but are limited to angular separations greater than a few beam widths. Accessing closer-in separations would greatly increase the expected number of detectable planets, which scales inversely with the inner working angle. The Vortex Fiber Nuller (VFN) is an instrument concept designed to characterize exoplanets within a single beam-width. It requires few optical elements and is compatible with many coronagraph designs as a complementary characterization tool. However, the peak throughput for planet light is limited to about 20%, and the measurement places poor constraints on the planet location and flux ratio. We propose to augment the VFN design by replacing its single-mode fiber with a six-port mode-selective photonic lantern, retaining the original functionality while providing several additional ports that reject starlight but couple planet light. We show that the photonic lantern can also be used as a nuller without a vortex. We present monochromatic simulations characterizing the response of the Photonic Lantern Nuller (PLN) to astrophysical signals and wavefront errors, and show that combining exoplanet flux from the nulled ports significantly increases the overall throughput of the instrument. We show using synthetically generated data that the PLN detects exoplanets more effectively than the VFN. Furthermore, with the PLN, the exoplanet can be partially localized, and its flux ratio constrained. The PLN has the potential to be a powerful characterization tool complementary to traditional coronagraphs in future high-contrast instruments. |

|| Lei Wang, <mark>Guoliang Li</mark>, Xi Kang |

|*Comments*| *Accepted for publications in MNRAS (15 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables)*|
|**Abstract**| In this article, we provide an alternative up-sampling and PSF deconvolution method for the iterative multi-exposure coaddition. Different from the previous works, the new method has a ratio-correction term, which allows the iterations to converge more rapidly to an accurate representation of the underlying image than those with difference-correction terms. By employing this method, one can coadd the under-sampled multi-exposures to a super-resolution and obtain a higher peak signal-to-noise ratio. A set of simulations show that we can take many advantages of the new method, e.g. in the signal-to-noise ratio, the average deviation of all source fluxes, super-resolution, and source distortion ratio, etc., which are friendly to astronomical photometry and morphology, and benefits faint source detection and shear measurement of weak gravitational lensing. It provides an improvement in fidelity over the previous works tested in this paper. |

|| <mark>Xiao Li</mark>, et al. -- incl., <mark>Cheng Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2022-09-19*|

|**Abstract**| We present a new HI mass estimator which relates the HI-to-stellar mass ratio to four galaxy properties: stellar surface mass density, color index $u-r$, stellar mass and concentration index, with the scatter of individual galaxies around the mean HI mass modeled with a Gaussian distribution. We calibrate the estimator using the xGASS sample, including both HI detection and non-detection, and constrain the model parameters through Bayesian inferences. Tests with mock catalogs demonstrate that our estimator provides unbiased HI masses for optical samples like the SDSS, thus suitable for statistical studies of HI gas contents in galaxies and dark matter halos. We apply our estimator to the SDSS spectroscopic sample to estimate the local HI mass function (HIMF), the conditional HI mass function (CHIMF) in galaxy groups and the HI-halo mass (HIHM) relation. Our HIMF agrees with the ALFALFA measurements at $M_{HI}\gtrsim 5\times 10^9M_{\odot}$, but with higher amplitude and a steeper slope at lower masses. We show that this discrepancy is caused primarily by the cosmic variance which is corrected for the SDSS sample but not for the ALFALFA. The CHIMFs for all halo masses can be described by a single Schechter function, and this is true for red, blue and satellite galaxies. For central galaxies the CHIMFs show a double-Gaussian profile, with the two components contributed by the red and blue galaxies, respectively. The total HI mass in a group increases monotonically with halo mass. The HI mass of central galaxies in galaxy groups increases rapidly with halo mass only at $M_h\lesssim10^{12}M_{\odot}$, while the mass dependence becomes much weaker at higher halo masses. The observed HI-halo mass relation is not reproduced by current hydrodynamic simulations and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. |

|**Abstract**| We investigate the second order gravitational waves induced by the primordial scalar and tensor perturbations during radiation-dominated era. The explicit expressions of the power spectra of the second order GWs are presented. We calculate the energy density spectra of the second order GWs for a monochromatic primordial power spectra. For large $k$ $\left( k>k_* \right)$, the effects of the primordial tensor perturbation with tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=A_{h}/A_{\zeta}=0.2$ lead to an around $50\% $ increase of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for LISA observations. |

|**Abstract**| Using the IllustrisTNG simulation, we study the interaction of large-scale shocks with the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and interstellar medium (ISM) of star-forming (SF) satellite galaxies in galaxy clusters. These shocks are usually produced by mergers and massive accretion. Our visual inspection shows that approximately half of SF satellites have encountered shocks in their host clusters at $z\leq0.11$. After a satellite crosses a shock front and enters the postshock region, the ram pressure on it is boosted significantly. Both the CGM and ISM can be severely impacted, either by striping or compression. The stripping of the ISM is particularly important for low-mass galaxies with $\log (M_{*}/M_{\odot})<10$ and can occur even in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. In comparison, satellites that do not interact with shocks lose their ISM only in the inner regions of clusters. About half of the ISM is stripped within about 0.6 Gyr after it crosses the shock front. Our results show that shock-induced stripping plays an important role in quenching satellite galaxies in clusters. |

|**Abstract**| Statistical studies of X-ray selected Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) indicate that the fraction of obscured AGN increases with increasing redshift, and the results suggest that a significant part of the accretion growth occurs behind obscuring material in the early universe. We investigate the obscured fraction of highly accreting X-ray AGN at around the peak epoch of supermassive black hole growth utilizing the wide and deep X-ray and optical/IR imaging datasets. A unique sample of luminous X-ray selected AGNs above $z>2$ was constructed by matching the XMM-SERVS X-ray point-source catalog with a PSF-convolved photometric catalog covering from $u^*$ to 4.5$\mu \mathrm{m}$ bands. Photometric redshift, hydrogen column density, and 2-10 keV AGN luminosity of the X-ray selected AGN candidates were estimated. Using the sample of 306 2-10 keV detected AGN at above redshift 2, we estimate the fraction of AGN with $\log N_{\rm H}\ (\rm cm^{-2})>22$, assuming parametric X-ray luminosity and absorption functions. The results suggest that $76_{-3}^{+4}\%$ of luminous quasars ($\log L_X\ (\rm erg\ s^{-1}) >44.5$) above redshift 2 are obscured. The fraction indicates an increased contribution of obscured accretion at high redshift than that in the local universe. We discuss the implications of the increasing obscured fraction with increasing redshift based on the AGN obscuration scenarios, which describe obscuration properties in the local universe. Both the obscured and unobscured $z>2$ AGN show a broad range of SEDs and morphology, which may reflect the broad variety of host galaxy properties and physical processes associated with the obscuration. |

|**Abstract**| We present the results of our studies of deuterated molecules (DCN, DNC, DCO$^+$, N$_2$D$^+$ and NH$_2$D) in regions of high-mass star formation, which include a survey of such regions with the 20-m Onsala radio telescope and mapping of several objects in various lines with the 30-m IRAM and 100-m MPIfR radio telescopes. The deuteration degree reaches $\sim$10$^{-2}$ in these objects. We discuss its dependencies on the gas temperature and velocity dispersion, as well as spatial distributions of deuterated molecules. We show that the H$^{13}$CN/HN$^{13}$C intensity ratio may be a good indicator of the gas kinetic temperature and estimate densities of the investigated objects. |

|**Abstract**| Based on a large spectroscopic sample of $\sim$ 4,300 RR Lyrae stars with metallicity, systemic radial velocity and distance measurements, we present a detailed analysis of the chemical and kinematic properties of the Galactic halo. Using this sample, the metallicity distribution function (MDF) as a function of $r$ and the velocity anisotropy parameter $\beta$ profiles (for different metallicity populations) are derived for the stellar halo. Both the chemical and kinematic results suggest that the Galactic halo is composed of two distinct parts, the inner halo and outer halo. The cutoff radius ($\sim$ 30 kpc) is similar to the previous break radius found in the density distribution of the stellar halo. We find that the inner part is dominated by a metal-rich population with extremely radial anisotropy ($\beta \sim 0.9$). These features are in accordance with those of ``{\it Gaia}-Enceladus-Sausage'' (GES) and we attribute this inner halo component as being dominantly composed of stars deposited from this ancient merged satellite. We find that GES probably has a slightly negative metallicity gradient. The metal-poor populations in the inner halo are characterized as a long-tail in MDF with an anisotropy of $\beta \sim 0.5$, which is similar to that of the outer part. The MDF for the outer halo is very broad with several weak peaks and the value of $\beta$ is around 0.5 for all metallicities. |

|**Abstract**| The modern time-domain photometric surveys collect a lot of observations of various astronomical objects, and the coming era of large-scale surveys will provide even more information. Most of the objects have never received a spectroscopic follow-up, which is especially crucial for transients e.g. supernovae. In such cases, observed light curves could present an affordable alternative. Time series are actively used for photometric classification and characterization, such as peak and luminosity decline estimation. However, the collected time series are multidimensional, irregularly sampled, contain outliers, and do not have well-defined systematic uncertainties. Machine learning methods help extract useful information from available data in the most efficient way. We consider several light curve approximation methods based on neural networks: Multilayer Perceptrons, Bayesian Neural Networks, and Normalizing Flows, to approximate observations of a single light curve. Tests using both the simulated PLAsTiCC and real Zwicky Transient Facility data samples demonstrate that even few observations are enough to fit networks and achieve better approximation quality than other state-of-the-art methods. We show that the methods described in this work have better computational complexity and work faster than Gaussian Processes. We analyze the performance of the approximation techniques aiming to fill the gaps in the observations of the light curves, and show that the use of appropriate technique increases the accuracy of peak finding and supernova classification. In addition, the study results are organized in a Fulu Python library available on GitHub, which can be easily used by the community. |

|**Abstract**| Although the sun is really far away from us, some solar activities could still influence the performance and reliability of space-borne and ground-based technological systems on Earth. Those time-varying conditions in space caused by the sun are also called space weather, as the atmospheric conditions that can affect weather on the ground. It is known that aviation activities can be affected during space weather events, but the exact effects of space weather on aviation are still unclear. Especially how the flight delays, the top topic concerned by most people, will be affected by space weather has never been thoroughly researched. By analyzing huge amount of flight data (~5X106 records), for the first time, we demonstrate that space weather events could have systematically modulating effects on flight delays. The average arrival delay time and 30-minute delay rate during space weather events are significantly increased by 81.34% and 21.45% respectively compared to those during quiet periods. The evident negative correlation between the yearly flight regularity rate and the yearly mean total sunspot number during 22 years also confirms such delay effects. Further studies indicate that the interference in communication and navigation caused by geomagnetic field fluctuations and ionospheric disturbances associated with the space weather events will increase the flight delay time and delay rate. These results expand the traditional field of space weather research and could also provide us with brand new views for improving the flight delay predications. |

|**Abstract**| Solar flare is one of the severest solar activities on the sun, and it has many important impacts on the near-earth space. It has been found that flight arrival delays will increase during solar flare. However, the detailed intrinsic mechanism of how solar flares influence the delays is still unknown. Based on 5-years huge amount of flight data, here we comprehensively analyze the flight departure delays during 57 solar flares. It is found that the averaged flight departure delay time during solar flares increased by 20.68% (7.67 min) compared to those during quiet periods. It is also shown that solar flare related flight delays reveal apparent time and latitude dependencies. Flight delays during dayside solar flares are more serious than those during nightside flares, and the longer (shorter) delays tend to occur in the lower (higher) latitude airport. Further analyses suggest that flight delay time and delay rate would be directly modulated by the solar intensity (soft X-ray flux) and the Solar Zenith Angle. For the first time, these results indicate that the communication interferences caused by solar flares will directly affect flight departure delay time and delay rate. This work also expands our conventional understandings to the impacts of solar flares on human society, and it could also provide us with brand new views to help prevent or cope with flight delays. |

|**Abstract**| Analyzing the effects of space weather on aviation is a new and developing topic. It has been commonly accepted that the flight time of the polar flights may increase during solar proton events because the flights have to change their route to avoid the high-energy particles. However, apart from such phenomenon, researches related to the flight time during space weather events is very rare. Based on the analyses of 39 representative international air routes around westerlies, it is found that 97.44% (94.87%) of the commercial airplanes on the westbound (eastbound) air routes reveal shorter (longer) flight time during solar proton events compared to those during quiet periods, and the averaged magnitude of change in flight time is ~10 min or 0.21%-4.17% of the total flight durations. Comparative investigations reassure the certainty of such phenomenon that the directional differences in flight time are still incontrovertible regardless of over-land routes (China-Europe) or over-sea routes (China-Western America). Further analyses suggest that the solar proton events associated atmospheric heating will change the flight durations by weakening certain atmospheric circulations, such as the polar jet stream. While the polar jet stream will not be obviously altered during solar flares so that the directional differences in flight time are not found. Besides the conventional space weather effects already known, this paper is the first report that indicates a distinct new scenario of how the solar proton events affect flight time. These analyses are also important for aviation since our discoveries could help the airways optimize the air routes to save passenger time costs, reduce fuel costs and even contribute to the global warming issues. |
