|**Abstract**| Near IR spectroscopic reverberation of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) potentially allows the infrared (IR) broad line region (BLR) to be reverberated alongside the disc and dust continua, while the spectra can also reveal details of dust astro-chemistry. Here, we describe results of a short pilot study (17 near-IR spectra over a 183 d period) for Mrk 509. The spectra give a luminosity-weighted dust radius of $\langle R_{\mathrm{d,lum}} \rangle = 186 \pm 4$ light-days for blackbody (large grain dust), consistent with previous (photometric) reverberation campaigns, whereas carbon and silicate dust give much larger radii. We develop a method of calibrating spectral data in objects where the narrow lines are extended beyond the slit width. We demonstrate this by showing our resultant photometric band light curves are consistent with previous results, with a hot dust lag at >40 d in the K band, clearly different from the accretion disc response at <20 d in the z band. We place this limit of 40 d by demonstrating clearly that the modest variability that we do detect in the H and K band does not reverberate on time-scales of less than 40 d. We also extract the Pa$\beta$ line light curve, and find a lag which is consistent with the optical BLR H$\beta$ line of $\sim$70-90 d. This is important as direct imaging of the near-IR BLR is now possible in a few objects, so we need to understand its relation to the better studied optical BLR. |

|**Abstract**| Nowadays, astronomers perform point spread function (PSF) fitting for most types of observational data. Interpolation of the PSF is often an intermediate step in such algorithms. In the case of the Multi-AO Imaging Camera for Deep Observations (MICADO) at the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), PSF interpolation will play a crucial role in high-precision astrometry for stellar clusters and confirmation of the Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBHs) presence. Significant PSF variations across the field of view invalidate the approach of deconvolution with a mean PSF or on-axis PSF. The ignoring of PSF variations can be especially unsatisfactory in the case of Single Conjugate Adaptive Optics (SCAO) observations, as these sophisticated and expensive systems are designed to achieve high resolution with ground-based telescopes by correcting for atmospheric turbulence in the direction of one reference star. In plenty of tasks, you face the question: How can I establish the quality of PSF fitting or interpolation? Our study aims to demonstrate the variety of PSF quality metrics, including the problem of revealing IMBHs in stellar clusters. |

|**Abstract**| In this paper, we conduct a multi-frequency analysis of the gamma-ray bright blazar 1308+326 from February 2013 to March 2020, using the Korean VLBI Network at 22 and 43 GHz and gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Our findings reveal spectral variations around the 2014 gamma-ray flare, aligning with the shock-in-jet model. A strong correlation is observed between gamma-ray and 43 GHz emissions, with a 27-day lag in the VLBI core light curve, indicating a 50-day delay from the beginning of a specific radio flare to the gamma-ray peak. This radio flare correlates with a new jet component, suggesting the 2014 gamma-ray flare resulted from its interaction with a stationary component. Our analysis indicates the 2014 gamma-ray flare originated 40-63 parsecs from the central engine, with seed photons for the gamma-ray emission unlikely from the broad-line region. |

|| <mark>S. Li</mark>, et al. |

|**Abstract**| Within the disk-corona model, it is natural to expect that a fraction of reflection photons from the disk are Compton scattered by the hot corona (reflection Comptonization), even if this effect is usually ignored in X-ray reflection spectroscopy studies. We study the effect by using NICER and NuSTAR data of the Galactic black hole EXO 1846-031 in the hard-intermediate state with the model SIMPLCUTX. Our analysis suggests that a scattered fraction of order 10% is required to fit the data, but the inclusion of reflection Comptonization does not change appreciably the measurements of key-parameters like the black hole spin and the inclination angle of the disk. |

|**Abstract**| Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn, play important roles in the formation and habitability of Earth-like planets. The detection of solar system analogs that have multiple cold giant planets is essential for our understanding of planet habitability and planet formation. Although transit surveys such as Kepler and TESS have discovered thousands of exoplanets, these missions are not sensitive to long period planets due to their limited observation baseline. The Tianyu project, comprising two 1-meter telescopes (Tianyu-I and II), is designed to detect transiting cold giant planets in order to find solar system analogs. Featuring a large field of view and equipped with a high-speed CMOS camera, Tianyu-I will perform a high-precision photometric survey of about 100 million stars, measuring light curves at hour-long cadence. The candidates found by Tianyu-I will be confirmed by Tianyu-II and other surveys and follow-up facilities through multi-band photometry, spectroscopy, and high resolution imaging. Tianyu telescopes will be situated at an elevation about 4000 meters in Lenghu, China. With a photometric precision of 1% for stars with V < 18 mag, Tianyu is expected to find more than 300 transiting exoplanets, including about 12 cold giant planets, over five years. A five-year survey of Tianyu would discover 1-2 solar system analogs. Moreover, Tianyu is also designed for non-exoplanetary exploration, incorporating multiple survey modes covering timescales from sub-seconds to months, with a particular emphasis on events occurring within the sub-second to hour range. It excels in observing areas such as infant supernovae, rare variable stars and binaries, tidal disruption events, Be stars, cometary activities, and interstellar objects. These discoveries not only enhance our comprehension of the universe but also offer compelling opportunities for public engagement in scientific exploration. |
