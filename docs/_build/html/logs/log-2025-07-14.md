|**Abstract**|            Euclid is presently mapping the distribution of matter in the Universe in detail via the weak lensing (WL) signature of billions of distant galaxies. The WL signal is most prominent around galaxy clusters, and can extend up to distances well beyond their virial radius, thus constraining their total mass. Near the centre of clusters, where contamination by member galaxies is an issue, the WL data can be complemented with strong lensing (SL) data which can diminish the uncertainty due to the mass-sheet degeneracy and provide high-resolution information about the distribution of matter in the centre of clusters. Here we present a joint SL and WL analysis of the Euclid Early Release Observations of the cluster Abell 2390 at z=0.228. Thanks to Euclid's wide field of view of 0.5 deg$^$2, combined with its angular resolution in the visible band of 0."13 and sampling of 0."1 per pixel, we constrain the density profile in a wide range of radii, 30 kpc < r < 2000 kpc, from the inner region near the brightest cluster galaxy to beyond the virial radius of the cluster. We find consistency with earlier X-ray results based on assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium, thus indirectly confirming the nearly relaxed state of this cluster. We also find consistency with previous results based on weak lensing data and ground-based observations of this cluster. From the combined SL+WL profile, we derive the values of the viral mass $M_{200} = (1.48 \pm 0.29)\times10^{15}\, \Msun$, and virial radius $r_{200} =(2.05\pm0.13 \, {\rm Mpc}$), with error bars representing one standard deviation. The profile is well described by an NFW model with concentration c=6.5 and a small-scale radius of 230 kpc in the 30\,kpc $< r <$ 2000\,kpc range that is best constrained by SL and WL data. Abell 2390 is the first of many examples where Euclid data will play a crucial role in providing masses for clusters.         |

|**Abstract**|            (Abridged) We present high angular resolution and sensitivity ALMA 3.1 mm and VLA 9.1 mm observations of the disc around CI Tau. These new data were combined with similar-resolution archival ALMA 0.9 and 1.3 mm observations and new and archival VLA 7.1 mm, 2.0, 3.0, and 6.0 cm photometry to study the properties of dust in this system. At wavelengths <3.1 mm, CI Tau's continuum emission is very extended and highly substructured (with three gaps, four rings, and two additional gap-ring pairs identified by non-parametric visibility modelling). Instead, the VLA 9.1 mm data are dominated by a bright central component, only partially (< 50%) due to dust emission, surrounded by a marginally detected, faint, and smooth halo. We fitted the ALMA and VLA 9.1 mm data together, adopting a physical model that accounts for the effects of dust absorption and scattering. For our fiducial dust composition ("Ricci" opacities), we retrieved a flat maximum grain size distribution across the disc radius of $(7.1\pm0.8)\times10^{-2}$ cm, that we tentatively attributed to fragmentation of fragile dust or bouncing. We tested, for the first time, the dependence of our results on the adopted dust composition model to assess which mixture can best reproduce the observations. We found that the "Ricci" opacities work better than the traditionally adopted "DSHARP" ones, while graphite-rich mixtures perform significantly worse. We also show that, for our fiducial composition, the data prefer low-porosity (< 70%) grains, in contrast with claims of highly porous aggregates in younger sources, which we tentatively justified by time-dependent compaction. Our results are in line with constraints from disc population synthesis models and naturally arise from CI Tau's peculiar spectral behaviour, making this disc an ideal target for deeper cm-wavelength and dust polarisation follow-ups.         |

|**Abstract**|            The supernova remnant (SNR) RCW86 is among the few SNRs with Balmer-emission lines containing broad and narrow spectral components that trace fast, non-radiative shocks in partially-ionized gas.\ These are invaluable laboratories for collisionless shock physics, especially for poorly-understood phenomena like electron-ion equilibration, and shock precursors. Here we present the first $\sim$0.3 pc spatial scale integral field unit (IFU) observations of the southwestern RCW86 shock, obtained as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V Local Volume Mapper (SDSS-V LVM). The forward shock, clearly visible as thin filaments in narrowband images, have broad H$\alpha$ components, indicating shock velocities varying from 500--900 km/s in the south to 1000--1500 km/s in the north. The varying velocity widths and broad-to-narrow intensity ratios show that electrons and ions have lower equilibration ($T_e/T_p \rightarrow 0.1$) in faster ($>$800 km/s) shocks, in line with previous studies. The broad components are generally redshifted from the narrow components by $\lesssim$100 km/s, likely due to shock-obliquity or non-Maxwellian post-shock distributions. We observe high extinction-corrected Balmer-decrements of 3--5 in the narrow components, indicating that conversion of Ly$\beta$ photons to H$\alpha$ is more efficient than Ly$\gamma$ to H$\beta$. Broad HeII$\lambda$4686 was marginally ($\gtrsim$2$\sigma$) detected in the southern shock, meaning the shock is impacting gas with high ($>$30--100\%) neutral fraction. We also find the first evidence of an intermediate H$\alpha$ component in RCW86, with $\Delta$V(FWHM) = 193--207 km/s, likely due to a neutral precursor. We also briefly discuss the southwestern radiative shock, and lay out the exciting future of studying astrophysical shocks with LVM.         |

|| <mark>X. Zhang</mark>, et al. |

|**Abstract**|            Deep imaging of structures from the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) in five targeted fields is one of the highest priority scientific objectives for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Selecting 'quiet' fields, which allow deep imaging, is critical for future SKA CD/EoR observations. Pre-observations using existing radio facilities will help estimate the computational capabilities required for optimal data quality and refine data reduction techniques. In this study, we utilize data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase II extended array for a selected field to study the properties of foregrounds. We conduct deep imaging across two frequency bands: 72-103 MHz and 200-231 MHz. We identify up to 2,576 radio sources within a 5-degree radius of the image center (at RA (J2000) $8^h$ , Dec (J2000) 5Â°), achieving approximately 80% completeness at 7.7 mJy and 90% at 10.4 mJy for 216 MHz, with a total integration time of 4.43 hours and an average RMS of 1.80 mJy. Additionally, we apply a foreground removal algorithm using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and calculate the angular power spectra of the residual images. Our results indicate that nearly all resolved radio sources can be successfully removed using PCA, leading to a reduction in foreground power. However, the angular power spectra of the residual map remains over an order of magnitude higher than the theoretically predicted CD/EoR 21 cm signal. Further improvements in data reduction and foreground subtraction techniques will be necessary to enhance these results.         |

|| X. Chen, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. Lee</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-14*|
|*Comments*| *9 pages, 3 figures, comments welcome!*|
|**Abstract**|            Theoretical models predict that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) exist in globular clusters (GCs), but observational evidence remains elusive. Millisecond pulsars (MSPs), which are abundant in GCs and have served as precise probes for gravitational waves (GWs), offer a unique opportunity to detect potential IMBH binaries in GCs. Here, we consider the possibility of using multiple MSPs in a GC to form a miniature pulsar timing array (PTA), so as to take advantage of their correlated timing residuals to search for potential IMBH binaries in the same cluster. Our semi-analytical calculations reveal that nearby IMBH binaries around MSPs in GCs could induce microsecond-level timing residuals. In GCs like $\omega$ Centauri and M15, favorable configurations are found which could lead to the detection of binaries with mass ratios $q\gtrsim0.1$ and orbital periods of a few days. We estimate that future higher-precision timing programs could achieve $100$-nanosecond sensitivity, substantially expanding the searchable parameter space and establishing mini-PTAs as powerful detectors of IMBHs.         |

|| <mark>J. Li</mark>, Y. Zheng, W. Zhu |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-14*|
|*Comments*| *28 pages, 14 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            We investigate the distribution of missing baryons in cosmic filaments by stacking approximately 31,300 filaments across the northern and southern SDSS sky regions using Planck Compton-$y$ and CMB lensing maps. Filaments are identified using the DisPerSE algorithm applied to the SDSS LOWZ-CMASS galaxy samples, selecting structures with lengths between 30-100 cMpc and redshifts in the range $0.2 < z < 0.6$. Radial profiles are extracted out to 25 cMpc from the filament spines, and galaxy clusters with halo masses above $3 \times 10^{13}$ solar masses are masked to reduce contamination. We detect the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) signal at $7.82\sigma$ and the CMB lensing signal at $7.78\sigma$. The stacked profiles are corrected by a geometric bias related to filament inclination with respect to the line of sight, and modeled assuming isothermal, cylindrically symmetric gas distributions. We explore different gas and matter density distributions, focusing on $\beta$-models with $(\alpha, \beta) = (2, 2/3)$ or $(1, 1)$. By jointly fitting the Compton-$y$ and lensing convergence profiles, we constrain the central electron overdensity and temperature to be $\delta = 5.90^{+4.18}_{-1.98}$ and $T_e = 2.71^{+0.63}_{-0.51} \times 10^6$ K for the standard $\beta$-model. These results suggest that the filamentary WHIM in our selected long filaments contributes a significant baryon fraction of $0.124^{+0.020}_{-0.021} \times$ {\Omega}_b to the cosmic baryon budget.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report the detection of GeV gamma-ray emission likely associated with supernova remnant (SNR) G335.2+0.1 and the finding of a molecular cloud ($\sim20$--$30^\prime$ in angular size) that is very likely in physical contact with the SNR and responsible for the gamma-ray emission. Using the 16.8 yr Fermi-LAT data, an extended emission, with a significance of 13.5 $\sigma$ and a radius 0.24Â° in 0.2--500 GeV in the uniform-disk model, was found to the adjacent east of the SNR. With archival Mopra CO-line data, a large molecular clump at local-standard-of-rest velocity $\sim-48$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$ was revealed appearing coincident with the gamma-ray source. The SNR was found located in a cavity encircled by a 'C'-shaped ring-like molecular shell at $-45$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$. This morphological agreement, together with the position-velociy diagrams made along lines cutting across the cavity, suggests that the SNR was evolving in the expanding molecular bubble created by the stellar wind of the progenitor with a mass $\gtrsim 15 M_{\mathrm{sun}}$. The giant molecular cloud, visible at around $-46$ km s$^{-1}$, and the associated SNR are thus estimated to lie at a kinematic distance of 3.1 kpc, with the HI absorption taken into account. We suggest that the SNR has entered the radiative phase after the blastwave recently struck the cavity wall. With the evolutionary scenario of the SNR, we demonstrate that the gamma-ray emission reported here can be naturally interpreted by the hadronic interaction between the accelerated protons that escaped from the SNR shock and the eastern large molecular clump.         |
