|**Abstract**|            The National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) will provide high-resolution, multi-line spectropolarimetric observations that are poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Sun. Given the massive data volume, novel inference techniques are required to unlock its full potential. Here, we provide an overview of our "SPIn4D" project, which aims to develop deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for estimating the physical properties of the solar photosphere from DKIST spectropolarimetric observations. We describe the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling and the Stokes profile synthesis pipeline that produce the simulated output and input data, respectively. These data will be used to train a set of CNNs that can rapidly infer the four-dimensional MHD state vectors by exploiting the spatiotemporally coherent patterns in the Stokes profile time series. Specifically, our radiative MHD model simulates the small-scale dynamo actions that are prevalent in quiet-Sun and plage regions. Six cases with different mean magnetic fields have been conducted; each case covers six solar-hours, totaling 109 TB in data volume. The simulation domain covers at least $25\times25\times8$ Mm with $16\times16\times12$ km spatial resolution, extending from the upper convection zone up to the temperature minimum region. The outputs are stored at a 40 s cadence. We forward model the Stokes profile of two sets of Fe I lines at 630 and 1565 nm, which will be simultaneously observed by DKIST and can better constrain the parameter variations along the line of sight. The MHD model output and the synthetic Stokes profiles are publicly available.         |

|**Abstract**|            Using data from the first flight of SPIDER and from Planck HFI, we probe the properties of polarized emission from interstellar dust in the SPIDER observing region. Component separation algorithms operating in both the spatial and harmonic domains are applied to probe their consistency and to quantify modeling errors associated with their assumptions. Analyses spanning the full SPIDER region demonstrate that i) the spectral energy distribution of diffuse Galactic dust emission is broadly consistent with a modified-blackbody (MBB) model with a spectral index of $\beta_\mathrm{d}=1.45\pm0.05$ $(1.47\pm0.06)$ for $E$ ($B$)-mode polarization, slightly lower than that reported by Planck for the full sky; ii) its angular power spectrum is broadly consistent with a power law; and iii) there is no significant detection of line-of-sight decorrelation of the astrophysical polarization. The size of the SPIDER region further allows for a statistically meaningful analysis of the variation in foreground properties within it. Assuming a fixed dust temperature $T_\mathrm{d}=19.6$ K, an analysis of two independent sub-regions of that field results in inferred values of $\beta_\mathrm{d}=1.52\pm0.06$ and $\beta_\mathrm{d}=1.09\pm0.09$, which are inconsistent at the $3.9\,\sigma$ level. Furthermore, a joint analysis of SPIDER and Planck 217 and 353 GHz data within a subset of the SPIDER region is inconsistent with a simple MBB at more than $3\,\sigma$, assuming a common morphology of polarized dust emission over the full range of frequencies. These modeling uncertainties have a small--but non-negligible--impact on limits on the cosmological tensor-to-scalar ratio derived from the \spider dataset. The fidelity of the component separation approaches of future CMB polarization experiments may thus have a significant impact on their constraining power.         |
