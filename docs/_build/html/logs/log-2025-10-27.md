|**Abstract**|            Double radio relics, pairs of diffuse radio features located on opposite sides of merging galaxy clusters, are a rare subclass of radio relics that are believed to trace merger shocks and provide valuable constraints on plasma acceleration models and merger history. With the number of known double relics growing in recent and upcoming radio surveys, statistical analyses of their properties are becoming feasible. In this study, we utilize the cosmological magnetohydrodynamics zoom-in simulations TNG-Cluster, in combination with TNG300-1, to examine the statistical properties of double radio relics. The simulated double relic pairs exhibit a wide range of luminosity ratios, broadly consistent with the observations. We find that the two relics in a given double system often differ significantly in their shock properties and magnetic field strengths. This diversity implies that the observed brightness asymmetry in the pair cannot be explained by a single factor alone, but instead reflects an interplay of multiple physical parameters. Nevertheless, double radio relics tend to align with the collision axis within $\sim30^{\circ}$ and their separation ($d_{\rm drr}$) correlates tightly with the time since collision (TSC) as ${\rm TSC~[Gyr]} = 0.52 d_{\rm drr}/R_{500\rm c} - 0.24$, allowing it to be inferred with an accuracy of $\sim0.2~\rm Gyr$. With the statistical samples of simulated radio relics, we predict that low-mass clusters will constitute the dominant population of double radio relic systems detected with upcoming surveys such as SKA. These results demonstrate that double radio relics can serve as robust probes of merger dynamics and plasma acceleration, and that simulations provide critical guidance for interpreting the large samples expected from next-generation radio surveys.         |

|**Abstract**|            Solar wind backmapping is a critical technique for analyzing the origin of the solar wind and space weather events by correlating in situ measurements with solar remote-sensing observations. This technique typically traces magnetic field lines using a heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) model coupled with a coronal magnetic field (CMF). However, the impact of different HMF and CMF configurations on backmapping uncentainty-particularly regarding high-latitude solar wind-remains inadequately quantified. This study comprehensively evaluates solar wind backmapping by combining two HMF models (Parker spiral, Fisk-type) with three CMF models (Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS), Potential Field Current Sheet (PFCS), Current Sheet Source Surface (CSSS)). Our analysis primarily uses in situ measurements from Ulysses and remote-sensing data from STEREO-A. Key findings are that: (1) while both Fisk and Parker HMF models show comparable consistency with measured magnetic field strength and polarity, they produce certain longitudinal displacements in their back-mapped footpoints on the source surface (2.5$R_{\odot}$); (2) For CMF models (PFSS, PFCS, CSSS), predicted photospheric footpoints exhibit minor variations for high/mid-latitude solar wind but some divergences for ecliptic/low-latitude wind; (3) All three CMF models link high/mid-latitude wind to active regions or coronal holes, yet associate a fraction of ecliptic/low-latitude wind with quiet-Sun regions; (4) Ecliptic/low-latitude sources show significantly stronger dependence on the PFSS source surface height compared to high-latitude wind. These results demonstrate that simpler models (PFSS + Parker) appear reasonably adequate for polar coronal hole wind studies, while low-latitude/ecliptic solar wind exhibits the heightened sensitivity to model choices.         |

|**Abstract**|            Gravitational-wave (GW) events are generally believed to originate in galaxies and can thus serve, like galaxies, as tracers of the universe's large-scale structure. In GW observations, waveform analysis provides direct measurements of luminosity distances; however, the redshifts of GW sources cannot be determined due to the mass-redshift degeneracy. By cross-correlating GW events with galaxies, one can establish a correspondence between luminosity distance and redshift shells, enabling cosmological inference. In this work, we explore the scientific potential of cross-correlating GW sources detected by third-generation (3G) ground-based GW detectors with the photometric redshift survey of the China Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST). We find that the constraint precisions of the Hubble constant and the matter density parameter can reach $1.04\%$ and $2.04\%$, respectively. The GW clustering bias parameters $A_{\rm GW}$ and $\gamma$ can be constrained to $1.52\%$ and $4.67\%$, respectively. These results highlight the significant potential of the synergy between CSST and 3G ground-based GW detectors in constraining cosmological models and probing GW source formation channels using cross-correlation of dark sirens and galaxies.         |
