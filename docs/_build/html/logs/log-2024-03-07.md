|**Abstract**| Even though sub-Neptunes likely represent the most common outcome of planet formation, their natures remain poorly understood. In particular, planets near 1.5-2.5$\,R_\oplus$ often have bulk densities that can be explained equally well with widely different compositions and interior structures, resulting in grossly divergent implications for their formation. Here, we present the full 0.6-5.2$\,\mu \mathrm{m}$ JWST NIRISS/SOSS+NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum of the 2.2$\,R_\oplus$ TOI-270d ($4.78\,M_\oplus$, $T_\mathrm{eq}$=350-380 K), delivering unprecedented sensitivity for atmospheric characterization in the sub-Neptune regime. We detect five vibrational bands of CH$_4$ at 1.15, 1.4, 1.7, 2.3, and 3.3$\,\mu$m (9.4$\sigma$), the signature of CO$_2$ at 4.3$\,\mu$m (4.8$\sigma$), water vapor (2.5$\sigma$), and potential signatures of SO$_2$ at 4.0$\,\mu \mathrm{m}$ and CS$_2$ at 4.6$\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. Intriguingly, we find an overall highly metal-rich atmosphere, with a mean molecular weight of $5.47_{-1.14}^{+1.25}$. We infer an atmospheric metal mass fraction of $58_{-12}^{+8}\%$ and a C/O of $0.47_{-0.19}^{+0.16}$, indicating that approximately half the mass of the outer envelope is in high-molecular-weight volatiles (H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO, CO$_2$) rather than H$_2$/He. We introduce a sub-Neptune classification scheme and identify TOI-270d as a "miscible-envelope sub-Neptune" in which H$_2$/He is well-mixed with the high-molecular-weight volatiles in a miscible supercritical metal-rich envelope. For a fully miscible envelope, we conclude that TOI-270d's interior is $90_{-4}^{+3}\,$wt$\,\%$ rock/iron, indicating that it formed as a rocky planet that accreted a few wt % of H$_2$/He, with the overall envelope metal content explained by magma-ocean/envelope reactions without the need for significant ice accretion. TOI-270d may well be an archetype of the overall population of sub-Neptunes. |

|**Abstract**| The ALMA [CII] Resolved Ism in STar-forming gALaxies (CRISTAL) survey is a Cycle 8 ALMA Large Programme that studies the cold gas component of high-redshift galaxies. Its sub-arcsecond resolution observations are key to disentangling physical mechanisms that shape galaxies during cosmic dawn. In this paper, we explore the morphology and kinematics of the cold gas, star-forming, and stellar components in the star-forming main-sequence galaxy CRISTAL-05/HZ3, at z = 5.54. Our analysis includes 0.3" spatial resolution (~2 kpc) ALMA observations of the [CII] line. While CRISTAL-05 was previously classified as a single source, our observations reveal that the system is a close interacting pair surrounded by an extended component of carbon-enriched gas. This is imprinted in the disturbed elongated [CII] morphology and the separation of the two components in the position-velocity diagram (~100 km/s). The central region is composed of two components, named C05-NW and C05-SE, with the former being the dominant one. A significant fraction of the [CII] arises beyond the close pair up to 10 kpc, while the regions forming new massive stars and the stellar component seem compact (r_[CII] ~ 4 r_UV), as traced by rest-frame UV and optical imaging obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope. Our kinematic model, using the DYSMALpy software, yields a minor contribution of dark matter of C05-NW within a radius of ~2x Reff. Finally, we explore the resolved [CII]/FIR ratios as a proxy for shock-heating produced by this merger. We argue that the extended [CII] emission is mainly caused by the merger, which could not be discerned with lower-resolution observations. Our work emphasizes the need for high-resolution observations to fully characterize the dynamic stages of infant galaxies and the physical mechanisms that drive the metal enrichment of the circumgalactic medium. |

|**Abstract**| The physical properties, evolution, and fragmentation of massive dense cores (MDCs, $\sim$ 0.1 pc) are fundamental pieces in our understanding of high-mass star formation. We aim to characterize the temperature, velocity dispersion, and fragmentation of the MDCs in the Cygnus X giant molecular cloud and to investigate the stability and dynamics of these cores. We present the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the NH$_3$ (J,K) = (1,1) and (2,2) inversion lines towards 35 MDCs in Cygnus X, from which we calculated the temperature and velocity dispersion. We extracted 202 fragments ($\sim$ 0.02 pc) from the NH$_3$ (1,1) moment-0 maps with the GAUSSCLUMPS algorithm. We analyzed the stability of the MDCs and their NH$_3$ fragments through evaluating the corresponding kinetic, gravitational potential, and magnetic energies and the virial parameters. The MDCs in Cygnus X have a typical mean kinetic temperature T$_K$ of $\sim$ 20 K. Our virial analysis shows that many MDCs are in subvirialized states, indicating that the kinetic energy is insufficient to support these MDCs against their gravity. The calculated nonthermal velocity dispersions of most MDCs are at transonic to mildly supersonic levels, and the bulk motions make only a minor contribution to the velocity dispersion. Regarding the NH$_3$ fragments, with T$_K$ $\sim$ 19 K, their nonthermal velocity dispersions are mostly trans-sonic to subsonic. Unless there is a strong magnetic field, most NH$_3$ fragments are probably not in virialized states. We also find that most of the NH$_3$ fragments are dynamically quiescent, while only a few are active due to star formation activity. |

|**Abstract**| Recent observations have found a large number of supermassive black holes already in place in the first few hundred million years after Big Bang. The channels of formation and growth of these early, massive black holes are not clear, with scenarios ranging from heavy seeds to light seeds experiencing bursts of high accretion rate. Here we present the detection, from the JADES survey, of broad Halpha emission in a galaxy at z=6.68, which traces a black hole with mass of ~ 4 * 10^8 Msun and accreting at a rate of only 0.02 times the Eddington limit. The host galaxy has low star formation rate (~ 1 Msun/yr, a factor of 3 below the star forming main sequence). The black hole to stellar mass ratio is ~ 0.4, i.e. about 1,000 times above the local relation, while the system is closer to the local relations in terms of dynamical mass and velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. This object is most likely the tip of the iceberg of a much larger population of dormant black holes around the epoch of reionisation. Its properties are consistent with scenarios in which short bursts of super-Eddington accretion have resulted in black hole overgrowth and massive gas expulsion from the accretion disk; in between bursts, black holes spend most of their life in a dormant state. |

|**Abstract**| The Galaxy inner parts are generally considered to be optically symmetric, as well as kinematically symmetric for most massive early-type galaxies. At the lower-mass end, many galaxies contain lots of small patches in their velocity maps, causing their kinematics to be nonsmooth in small scales and far from symmetry. These small patches can easily be mistaken for measurement uncertainties and have not been well discussed. We used the comparison of observations and numerical simulations to demonstrate the small patches existence beyond uncertainties. For the first time we have found that the fluctuation degrees have an approximate inverse loglinear relation with the galaxy stellar surface mass densities. This tight relation among galaxies that do not show obvious optical asymmetry that traces environmental perturbations indicates that stellar motion in galaxies has inherent asymmetry besides external environment influences. The degree of the kinetic asymmetry is closely related to and constrained by the intrinsic properties of the host galaxy. |

|**Abstract**| We have comprehensively studied the multi-scale physical properties of the infrared dark cloud (IRDC) G28.34 (the Dragon cloud) with dust polarization and molecular line data from Planck, FCRAO-14m, JCMT, and ALMA. We find that the averaged magnetic fields of clumps tend to be either parallel with or perpendicular to the cloud-scale magnetic fields, while the cores in clump MM4 tend to have magnetic fields aligned with the clump fields. Implementing the relative orientation analysis (for magnetic fields, column density gradients, and local gravity), Velocity Gradient Technique, and modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi analysis, we find that: G28.34 is located in a trans-to-sub-Alfv\'{e}nic environment ($\mathcal{M}_{A}=0.74$ within $r=15$ pc); the magnetic field is effectively resisting gravitational collapse in large-scale diffuse gas, but is distorted by gravity within the cloud and affected by star formation activities in high-density regions; and the normalized mass-to-flux ratio tends to increase with density and decrease with radius. Considering both the magnetic and turbulent support, we find that the environmental gas of G28.34 is in a super-virial (supported) state, the infrared dark clumps may be in a near-equilibrium state, and core MM4-core4 is in a sub-virial (gravity-dominant) state. In summary, we suggest that magnetic fields dominate gravity and turbulence in the cloud environment at large scales, resulting in relatively slow cloud formation and evolution processes. Within the cloud, gravity could overwhelm both magnetic fields and turbulence, allowing local dynamical star formation to happen. |
