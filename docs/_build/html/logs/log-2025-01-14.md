|**Abstract**|            We compare the internal stellar structures of central galaxies in the TNG50 and TNG100 simulations and field galaxies in the CALIFA survey. The luminosity fractions of the dynamically cold, warm, and hot components in both TNG50 and TNG100 galaxies exhibit general consistency with those observed in CALIFA galaxies. For example, they all exhibit a minimum luminosity fraction of the dynamically hot component in galaxies with intermediate stellar masses, and the morphology of each orbital component in the TNG50 and TNG100 galaxies closely resembles that found in the CALIFA galaxies. We therefore use the simulations to quantify the physical origins of the different components, focusing on the dynamically hot component in TNG50. We identify three primary regimes and thus physical processes: (1) in low mass galaxies that have not experienced major mergers, stars are born with a wide range of circularity distributions and have remained relatively unchanged until the present day. Consequently, hot stars in such galaxies at redshift 0 are predominantly born hot. (2) In higher mass galaxies lacking major mergers, most stars are initially born cold but are subsequently heated through secular evolution. (3) In galaxies across the entire mass range, mergers, if they occurred, significantly increased the hot orbital fraction. As a result, the dynamically hot bulge within $R_e$ of present-day galaxies does not indicate their past merger histories; instead, the hot stars in the outer regions are mostly heated or accreted by mergers, thus indicating galaxy merger history. The massive galaxies are initially born with cold, rotationally supported structures, consistent with recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) regarding high-redshift galaxies.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a simulation-based method to explore the optimum tomographic redshift binning strategy for 3x2pt analyses with Euclid, focusing on the expected configuration of its first major data release (DR1). To do this, we 1) simulate a Euclid-like observation and generate mock shear catalogues from multiple realisations of the 3x2pt fields on the sky, and 2) measure the 3x2pt Pseudo-Cl power spectra for a given tomographic configuration and derive the constraints that they place on the standard dark energy equation of state parameters (w0, wa). For a simulation including Gaussian-distributed photometric redshift uncertainty and shape noise under a LambdaCDM cosmology, we find that bins equipopulated with galaxies yield the best constraints on (w0, wa) for an analysis of the full 3x2pt signal, or the angular clustering component only. For the cosmic shear component, the optimum (w0, wa) constraints are achieved by bins equally spaced in fiducial comoving distance. However, the advantage with respect to alternative binning choices is only a few percent in the size of the $1\,\sigma\,$(w0, wa) contour, and we conclude that the cosmic shear is relatively insensitive to the binning methodology. We find that the information gain extracted on (w0, wa) for any 3x2pt component starts to saturate at $\gtrsim$ 7-8 bins. Any marginal gains resulting from a greater number of bins is likely to be limited by additional uncertainties present in a real measurement, and the increasing demand for accuracy of the covariance matrix. Finally, we consider a 5% contamination from catastrophic photometric redshift outliers and find that, if these errors are not mitigated in the analysis, the bias induced in the 3x2pt signal for 10 equipopulated bins results in dark energy constraints that are inconsistent with the fiducial LambdaCDM cosmology at $>5\,\sigma$.         |

|**Abstract**|            The next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) is intended to be the premier centimeter-wavelength facility for astronomy and astrophysics, building on the substantial scientific legacies of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The ngVLA would open a new window on the Universe through ultra-sensitive imaging of thermal line and continuum emission to milliarcsecond resolution, while delivering unprecedented broad-band continuum imaging and polarimetry of non-thermal emission. The ngVLA would provide a critical electromagnetic complement to a suite of particle detectors and gravitational-wave observatories, as well as space- and ground-based telescopes operating from infrared to gamma-ray wavelengths, hence enabling multi-messenger and multi-band astronomy and astrophysics. Current construction plans call for the ngVLA to leverage some of the physical infrastructure of both the VLA and the VLBA, potentially drawing on overlapping personnel and information infrastructure. Multiple options can be envisioned for a VLA+VLBA to ngVLA transition. In order to assess risks and benefits of possible transition plans, the ngVLA project established the VLA+VLBA to ngVLA Transition Advisory Group (TAG). The primary deliverable from the TAG is a ``VLA+VLBA to ngVLA Transition Option Concepts'' report (this report) that includes a prioritized list of transition options.         |

|| J. V. Zandt, et al. -- incl., <mark>I. J. M. Crossfield</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            We present the results of the Distant Giants Survey, a three-year radial velocity (RV) campaign to search for wide-separation giant planets orbiting Sun-like stars known to host an inner transiting planet. We defined a distant giant to have $a$ = 1--10 AU and $M_{p} \sin i = 70-4000$ \mearth~ = 0.2-12.5 \mj, and required transiting planets to have $a<1$ AU and $R_{p} = 1-4$ \rearth. We assembled our sample of 47 stars using a single selection function, and observed each star at monthly intervals to obtain $\approx$30 RV observations per target. The final catalog includes a total of twelve distant companions: four giant planets detected during our survey, two previously known giant planets, and six objects of uncertain disposition identified through RV/astrometric accelerations. Statistically, half of the uncertain objects are planets and the remainder are stars/brown dwarfs. We calculated target-by-target completeness maps to account for missed planets. We found evidence for a moderate enhancement of distant giants (DG) in the presence of close-in small planets (CS), P(DG|CS) = $30^{+14}_{-12}\%$, over the field rate of P(DG) = $16^{+2}_{-2}\%$. No enhancement is disfavored ($p \sim$ 8%). In contrast to a previous study, we found no evidence that stellar metallicity enhances P(DG|CS). We found evidence that distant giant companions are preferentially found in systems with multiple transiting planets and have lower eccentricities than randomly selected giant planets. This points toward dynamically cool formation pathways for the giants that do not disturb the inner systems.         |

|| K. Shepard, et al. -- incl., <mark>S. Kraus</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-01-14*|
|*Comments*| *Published in ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            W Serpentis is an eclipsing binary system and the prototype of the Serpentid class of variable stars. These are interacting binaries experiencing intense mass transfer and mass loss. However, the identities and properties of both stars in W Ser remain a mystery. Here we present an observational analysis of high quality, visible-band spectroscopy made with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope and ARCES spectrograph plus the first near-IR, long-baseline interferometric observations obtained with the CHARA Array. We present examples of the appearance and radial velocities of the main spectral components: prominent emission lines, strong shell absorption lines, and weak absorption lines. We show that some of the weak absorption features are associated with the cool mass donor, and we present the first radial velocity curve for the donor star. The donor's absorption lines are rotationally broadened, and we derive a ratio of donor to gainer mass of 0.36 +/- 0.09 based on the assumptions that the donor fills its Roche lobe and rotates synchronously with the orbit. We use a fit of the ASAS light curve to determine the orbital inclination and mass estimates of 2.0 and 5.7 solar masses for the donor and gainer, respectively. The partially resolved interferometric measurements of orbital motion are consistent with our derived orbital properties and the distance from Gaia EDR3. Spectroscopic evidence indicates that the gainer is enshrouded in an opaque disk that channels the mass transfer stream into an outflow through the L3 region and into a circumbinary disk.         |

|*Comments*| *Published on RNAAS, Oct 2024. 4 pages, 1 figure. Further work in progress and comments are welcome*|
|**Abstract**|            We report a spectroscopic observation of comet C/2023 A3 using an 80 mm apochromatic (apo) refractor equipped with a custom-built spectrometer with a resolution of R~2,500 on the night of 4 October 2024. Sodium D lines were detected prominently, while no other emission lines, particularly carbon-bearing species, were observed, which suggests that comet C/2023 A3 may be carbon-depleted. The mobility and flexibility of our observational setup highlight the value of amateur telescopes in observing low-altitude targets like C/2023 A3 as a complement to professional facilities.         |

|| T.-N. Li, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-01-14*|
|*Comments*| *10 pages, 3 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            There is a possibility of interaction between dark energy and dark matter, and this interaction may also undergo a sign change during the evolution of the universe. In this paper, we utilize the latest observational data to constrain models of a sign-changeable interaction. The data we employ, in addition to the cosmic microwave background data, also encompass the first-year baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI and the type Ia supernova data of the full 5-year observation from DES. To achieve high generality, we investigate four interacting dark energy (IDE) models with different forms of the interaction term $Q$: (i) IDE1 with $Q = \beta(a)H\rho_{\rm de}$; (ii) IDE2 with $Q = \beta(a)H\rho_{\rm c}$; (iii) IDE3 with $Q = \beta(a)H_0\rho_{\rm de}$; (iv) IDE4 with $Q = \beta(a)H_0\rho_{\rm c}$. From the analysis, we observe that $\beta(z) > 0$ at early times and $\beta(z) < 0$ at late times, with the coupling $\beta(z)$ crossing the non-interacting line $\beta(z) = 0$ during cosmic evolution at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level for the IDE1, IDE3, and IDE4 models. However, for the IDE2 model, $\beta(z)$ remains consistently negative and does not cross $\beta(z) = 0$ at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level. Our findings indicate that the energy transfer is from dark matter to dark energy when dark matter dominates the universe, and from dark energy to dark matter when dark energy dominates, for the IDE1 and IDE3 models. Furthermore, Bayesian evidence suggests that the IDE1 and IDE3 models are moderately preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model. The overall outcomes of this study clearly indicate that, based on current observational data, the sign-changeable IDE models are quite compelling and merit further attention.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Einstein Probe (EP) is an interdisciplinary mission of time-domain and X-ray astronomy. Equipped with a wide-field lobster-eye X-ray focusing imager, EP will discover cosmic X-ray transients and monitor the X-ray variability of known sources in 0.5-4 keV, at a combination of detecting sensitivity and cadence that is not accessible to the previous and current wide-field monitoring missions. EP can perform quick characterisation of transients or outbursts with a Wolter-I X-ray telescope onboard. In this paper, the science objectives of the Einstein Probe mission are presented. EP is expected to enlarge the sample of previously known or predicted but rare types of transients with a wide range of timescales. Among them, fast extragalactic transients will be surveyed systematically in soft X-rays, which include {\gamma}-ray bursts and their variants, supernova shock breakouts, and the predicted X-ray transients associated with binary neutron star mergers. EP will detect X-ray tidal disruption events and outbursts from active galactic nuclei, possibly at an early phase of the flares for some. EP will monitor the variability and outbursts of X-rays from white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes in our and neighbouring galaxies at flux levels fainter than those detectable by the current instruments, and is expected to discover new objects. A large sample of stellar X-ray flares will also be detected and characterised. In the era of multi-messenger astronomy, EP has the potential of detecting the possible X-ray counterparts of gravitational wave events, neutrino sources, and ultra-high energy {\gamma}-ray and cosmic ray sources. EP is expected to help advance the studies of extreme objects/phenomena and their underlying physical processes revealed in the dynamic X-ray universe, as well as studies in other areas of X-ray astronomy.         |
