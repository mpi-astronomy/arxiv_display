|**Abstract**|            The first stars formed out of pristine gas, causing them to be so massive that none are expected to have survived until today. If their direct descendants were sufficiently low-mass stars, they could exist today and would be recognizable by having the lowest metallicity (abundance of elements heavier than helium). The lowest metallicity star currently known is a star in the thick disk of the Milky Way with total metallicity Z < 1.4 x 10^-6 (log Z/Zsun < -4.0). While other stars with lower iron abundance have been discovered, they have high carbon abundances and thus higher total metallicities (log Z/Zsun > -3). Here we present the discovery and detailed chemical analysis of the most metal-poor star yet found: the red giant star SDSS J0715-7334 with ultra-low abundances of both iron and carbon ([Fe/H]=-4.3, [C/Fe]<-0.2), resulting in total metallicity Z < 7.8 x 10^-7 (log Z/Zsun < -4.3). This star has the most pristine composition of any object known in the universe. The star's orbit indicates that it originates from the halo of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Its detailed chemical composition implies a supernova progenitor with initial mass of 30 solar masses. Current models of low-mass star formation can explain the existence of SDSS J0715-7334 only if dust cooling was already able to operate at the time of its formation. SDSS J0715-7334 is over ten times more metal-poor than the most metal-poor high-redshift galaxies found by the James Webb Space Telescope, some of which have been claimed to be potentially metal-free. Substantially deeper observations of high-redshift galaxies would be needed to prove that they are truly pristine galaxies made of metal-free stars and not metal-enriched galaxies composed of second-generation stars like SDSS J0715-7334.         |

|| M. Bannister, et al. -- incl., <mark>H. Klahr</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-09-29*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in Space Science Reviews. Chapter written for the the workshop 'Exocomets: Bridging our Understanding of Minor Bodies in Solar and Exoplanetary Systems' (July 2024), at the International Space Science Insitute (ISSI), Bern*|
|**Abstract**|            Small bodies exist in distinct populations within their planetary systems. These reservoir populations hold a range of compositions, which to first order are dependent on formation location relative to their star. We provide a general overview of the nature of the reservoirs that source exocomets, from the influence of the stellar environment through planetesimal formation to comparisons with Solar System populations. Once transitioned from a young protoplanetary disc to a debris disc, a star can expect to be rained with exocomets. While exocomets are predominantly detected to date at A-type stars, planetesimals plausibly exist across a range of stellar masses, based on exoplanet abundance, debris disc occurrence and white dwarf infall.         |

|| Y. Meng, et al. -- incl., <mark>L. Xie</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-09-29*|
|*Comments*| *16 pages, 7 figures; Submitted to ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            The impact of cosmic web environments on galaxy properties plays a critical role in understanding galaxy formation. Using the state-of-the-art cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG, we investigate how satellite galaxy abundance differs between filaments and the field, with filaments identified using the DisPerSE algorithm. When filaments are identified using galaxies as tracers, we find that, across all magnitude bins, central galaxies in filaments tend to host more satellite galaxies than their counterparts in the field, in qualitative agreement with observational results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The average ratios between satellite luminosity functions in filaments and the field are $3.49$, $2.61$, and $1.90$ in the central galaxy $r$-band magnitude bins of $M_{r, {\rm cen}} \sim -22$, $-21$, and $-20$, respectively. We show that much of this excess can be attributed to the higher host halo masses of galaxies in filaments. After resampling central galaxies in both environments to match the halo mass distributions within each magnitude bin, the satellite abundance enhancement in filaments is reduced by up to $79 \%$. Additionally, the choice of tracers used to identify filaments introduces a significant bias: when filaments are identified using the dark matter density field, the environmental difference in satellite abundance is reduced by more than $70 \%$; after further resampling in both magnitude and halo mass, the difference is further suppressed by another $\sim 60$--$95 \%$. Our results highlight the importance of halo mass differences and tracer choice biases when interpreting and understanding the impact of environment on satellite galaxy properties.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2025-09-29*|
|*Comments*| *6 pages, 7 figures. Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Low Temperature Detectors (LTD2025)*|
|**Abstract**|            The Simons Observatory (SO) is a new suite of cosmic microwave background telescopes in the Chilean Atacama Desert with an extensive science program spanning cosmology, Galactic and extragalactic astrophysics, and particle physics. SO will survey the millimeter-wave sky over a wide range of angular scales using six spectral bands across three types of dichroic, polarization-sensitive transition-edge sensor (TES) detector modules: Low-Frequency (LF) modules with bandpasses centered near 30 and 40 GHz, Mid-Frequency (MF) modules near 90 and 150 GHz, and Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF) modules near 220 and 280 GHz. Twenty-five UHF detector modules, each containing 1720 optically-coupled TESs connected to microwave SQUID multiplexing readout, have now been produced. This work summarizes the pre-deployment characterization of these detector modules in laboratory cryostats. Across all UHF modules, we find an average operable TES yield of 83%, equating to over 36,000 devices tested. The distributions of (220, 280) GHz saturation powers have medians of (24, 26) pW, near the centers of their target ranges. For both bands, the median optical efficiency is 0.6, the median effective time constant is 0.4 ms, and the median dark noise-equivalent power (NEP) is ~40 aW/rtHz. The expected photon NEPs at (220, 280) GHz are (64, 99) aW/rtHz, indicating these detectors will achieve background-limited performance on the sky. Thirty-nine UHF and MF detector modules are currently operating in fielded SO instruments, which are transitioning from the commissioning stage to full science observations.         |

|| Q. Ye, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-09-29*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication on Acta Astronautica, PDC 2025 Special Issue*|
|**Abstract**|            The Taurid Resonant Swarm (TRS) within the Taurid Complex hosts dynamically-concentrated debris in a 7:2 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter. Fireball observations have confirmed that the TRS is rich in sub-meter-sized particles, but whether this enhancement extends to larger, asteroid-sized objects remains unclear. Here we reanalyze the data obtained by a Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) campaign during the 2022 TRS encounter, and find that the TRS may host up to $\sim10^2$ Tunguska-sized objects and up to $\sim10^3$ Chelyabinsk-sized objects, the latter of which agrees the estimate derived from bolide records. This translates to an impact frequency of less than once every 4 million years. However, we caution that these numbers are based on the unverified assumption that the orbital distribution of the TRS asteroids follows that of fireball-sized meteoroids. Future wide-field facilities, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, could take advantage of TRS's close approaches in the 2020-30s and validate the constraints of the asteroid-sized objects in the TRS.         |

|**Abstract**|            With JWST, observing separate spectra of the morning and evening limbs of hot Jupiters has finally become a reality. The first such observation was reported for WASP-39b, where the evening terminator was observed to have a larger transit radius by about 400 ppm and a stronger 4.3 $\mu$m CO$_2$ feature than the morning terminator. Multiple factors, including temperature differences, photo/thermochemistry, clouds and hazes, could cause such limb asymmetries. To interpret these new limb asymmetry observations, a detailed understanding of how the relevant processes affect morning and evening spectra grounded in forward models is needed. Focusing on WASP-39b, we compare simulations from five different general circulation models (GCMs), including one simulating disequilibrium thermochemistry and one with cloud radiative feedback, to the recent WASP-39b limb asymmetry observations. We also post-process the temperature structures of all simulations with a 2D photochemical model and one simulation with a cloud microphysics model. Although the temperatures predicted by the different models vary considerably, the models are remarkably consistent in their predicted morning--evening temperature differences. Several equilibrium-chemistry simulations predict strong methane features in the morning spectrum, not seen in the observations. When including disequilibrium processes, horizontal transport homogenizes methane, and these methane features disappear. However, even after including photochemistry and clouds, our models still cannot reproduce the observed ${\sim}2000$ ppm asymmetry in the CO$_2$ feature. A combination of factors, such as varying metallicity and unexplored parameters in cloud models, may explain the discrepancy, emphasizing the need for future models integrating cloud microphysics and feedback across a broader parameter space.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the first results from the ALMA Perseus Polarization Survey (ALPPS), focusing on the magnetic field in the SVS13A circumbinary disk. The dataset includes full-Stokes dust continuum observations at $\sim0\farcs3$ and 870 $\mu$m, as well as molecular line emission from C$^{17}$O$(J=3 \rightarrow 2)$ at $\sim0\farcs3$, C$^{18}$O$(J=2 \rightarrow 1)$ at $\sim0\farcs2$, and DCN$(J=3 \rightarrow 2)$ at $\sim0\farcs1$ angular resolution. Our observations resolve both a previously identified dust spiral and an infalling streamer, capturing their spatial and kinematic structures. The streamer is traced from scales $>300$ au down to the circumbinary disk. Using alignment measure (AM) maps and histograms that compare the orientations of the plane-of-sky magnetic field with local intensity and velocity gradients, we find that the AM distribution peaks at a value of 1. This AM peak strongly suggests alignment between the field and the dust total intensity emission, as well as between the field and the gas velocity, which in turn suggests grain alignment by magnetic fields. From our data, we derive a magnetic field strength, B$_{\mathrm{pos}} \sim 1.1 \pm 0.6$\, mG, and a kinetic to magnetic energy ratio of $0.5 \pm 0.4$, suggesting magnetic dominance. We also produced a map of the Alfvénic Mach number, finding $\mathcal{M}_{\rm A} < 1$ along the streamer, consistent with sub-Alfvénic infalling motions. Therefore, the field is likely facilitating the inflow of material from the envelope onto the disk by constraining movement across the field lines. This represents the first detection of a magnetically sub-Alfvénic infalling streamer in a protostellar system.         |
