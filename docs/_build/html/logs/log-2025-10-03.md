|**Abstract**|            Eddington ratio is a paramount parameter governing the accretion history and life cycles of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This short review presents a multi-faceted view of the importance of the Eddington ratio spanning varied AGN studies. We find that the Eddington ratio is crucial for standardizing the Radius-Luminosity (R-L) relation - a necessary step for employing quasars (QSOs) as standardizable cosmological probes to help clarify the standing of the Hubble tension. In this data-driven era, we consolidated disparate aspects by developing novel relations borne out of large datasets, such as the robust, nearly universal anti-correlation between fractional variability and Eddington ratio derived from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, which is vital for interpreting forthcoming high-cadence surveys like Rubin Observatory's LSST. Addressing the conundrum where JWST results suggest an overabundance of massive high-redshift black holes, we demonstrate that local AGNs offer clarification: Changing-Look AGNs (CLAGNs), driven by rapid Eddington ratio shifts, cluster in the low-accretion regime, a rate independently confirmed by our integral field spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of a well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy, rich in high-ionization, forbidden, coronal lines. Conversely, for the high-redshift, high-luminosity population where traditional reverberation mapping (RM) is highly impractical, photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) offers a rapid alternative to constrain accretion disk sizes, enabling efficient estimates of black hole masses and Eddington ratios. Finally, we developed tailored semi-empirical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for extremely high-accretion quasars, successfully validating their characteristic extreme physical conditions.         |

|**Abstract**|            Stellar feedback drives multiphase gas outflows from starburst galaxies, but the interpretation of dust emission in these winds remains uncertain. To investigate this, we analyze new JWST mid-infrared images tracing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at 7.7 and 11.3~$\mu$m from the outflow of the prototypical starburst M82 out to $3.2$ kpc. We find that PAH emission shows significant correlations with CO, H$\alpha$, and X-ray emission within the outflow, though the strengths and behaviors of these correlations vary with gas phase and distance from the starburst. PAH emission correlates strongly with cold molecular gas, with PAH--CO scaling relations in the wind nearly identical to those in galaxy disks despite the very different conditions. The H$\alpha$--PAH correlation indicates that H$\alpha$ traces the surfaces of PAH-bearing clouds, consistent with arising from ionized layers produced by shocks. Meanwhile the PAH--X-ray correlation disappears once distance effects are controlled for past 2~kpc, suggesting that PAHs are decoupled from the hot gas and the global correlation merely reflects the large-scale structure of the outflow. The PAH-to-neutral gas ratio remains nearly flat to 2~kpc, with variations following changes in the radiation field. This implies that the product of PAH abundance and dust-to-gas ratio does not change significantly over the inner portion of the outflow. Together, these results demonstrate that PAHs robustly trace the cold phase of M82's wind, surviving well beyond the starburst and providing a powerful, high-resolution proxy for mapping the life cycle of entrained cold material in galactic outflows.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the discovery and characterisation of two Ly$\alpha$ nebulae (LANs), RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat, as satellite structures of two giant LANs at $z=2.920$ and 3.092. They are found neighbouring two out of four known giant LANs at $z\sim3$ in our MUSE follow-up observations, reinforcing the idea that Ly$\alpha$ emission can be used to trace massive dark matter halos at high-$z$. This high occurrence of massive satellite halos agrees with simulations. With sizes of $\simeq80\times160$ and $80\times100~\mathrm{pkpc}^2$, the two nebulae are both $\sim$300pkpc from the main LANs. The Ly$\alpha$ emission is only shifted by $\simeq100-300$ km s$^{-1}$ between each of the two pairs, suggesting connections via large-scale structure. RO-1001-Sat and RO-0959-Sat are estimated to have log$(M_\mathrm{h}/M_\odot)\simeq13.2\pm0.3$ and $12.8\pm0.3$, putting them potentially close to the regime of cold-mode accretion. The central brightest galaxies in the two halos are morphologically distinct despite having similar stellar mass $\sim10^{11}M_\odot$, one being an elliptical quiescent galaxy in RO-1001-Sat and the other being a dusty star-forming spiral in RO-0959-Sat. Intriguingly, the quiescent galaxy aligns well with the peak of the LAN as well as the potential well of the host halo, making it the first clear-cut case where the cold gas ought to be accreting onto the galaxy but with no observable star formation, either due to morphological quenching or, more likely, radio-mode feedback from an active galactic nucleus. Finally, we show a tentative detection of a Ly$\alpha$ filament connecting RO-1001 and RO-1001-Sat. This work shows how panoramic MUSE (and in the future, BlueMUSE) observations of massive halo seeds can be used to efficiently search for additional halos, unveiling their large-scale structure and enabling the study of Ly$\alpha$-selected galaxy groups.         |

|**Abstract**|            Recent observations from NICER in X-rays and LIGO/Virgo in gravitational waves have provided critical constraints on the mass, radius, and tidal deformability of neutron stars, imposing stringent limits on the equation of state (EOS) and the behavior of ultra-dense matter. However, several key parameters influencing the EOS, such as the maximum mass of neutron stars, spin-down rates, and the potential role of exotic matter in their cores, remain subject of ongoing debate. Here we present a new approach to constraining the EOS by analyzing the X-ray afterglows of some short gamma-ray bursts, focusing on "the internal plateau" phase and its abrupt decay, which reflect the spin-down and possible collapse of a supra-massive neutron star into a black hole. By linking critical neutron star masses with black hole formation criteria and the observational data from Swift's BAT and XRT instruments with compact object models, we explore three representative EOSs that range from "soft" to "stiff". Our result supports a maximum mass for neutron stars of approximately 2.39 solar masses at the threshold of black hole formation. This conclusion holds under assumptions of magnetar-powered X-ray plateaus, constant radiative efficiency, isotropic emission, and full Kerr black hole energy extraction; deviations could influence the inferred results. Our results demonstrate the critical role of neutron star/black hole physics in probing dense nuclear matter and provide a novel framework for exploring extreme astrophysical environments.         |
