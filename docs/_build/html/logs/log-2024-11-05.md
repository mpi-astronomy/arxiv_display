|**Abstract**|            Core ellipticals, massive early-type galaxies have an almost constant inner surface brightness profile. The size of the core region correlates with the mass of the finally merged black hole. Here we report the first Euclid-based dynamical mass determination of a supermassive black hole. We study the centre of NGC 1272, the second most luminous elliptical galaxy in the Perseus cluster, combining the Euclid VIS photometry coming from the Early Release Observations of the Perseus cluster with VIRUS spectroscopic observations at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. The core of NGC 1272 is detected on the Euclid VIS image. Its size is $1.29\pm 0.07''$ or 0.45 kpc, determined by fitting PSF-convolved core-SÃ©rsic and Nuker-law functions. The two-dimensional stellar kinematics of the galaxy is measured from the VIRUS spectra by deriving optimally regularized non-parametric line-of-sight velocity distributions. Dynamical models of the galaxy are constructed using our axisymmetric and triaxial Schwarzschild codes. We measure a black hole mass of $(5\pm3) \times 10^9 M_\odot$, in line with the expectation from the $M_{\rm BH}$-$r_{\rm b}$ correlation, but eight times larger than predicted by the $M_{\rm BH}$-$\sigma$ correlation (at $1.8\sigma$ significance). The core size, rather than the velocity dispersion, allows one to select galaxies harboring the most massive black holes. The spatial resolution, wide area coverage, and depth of the \Euclid (Wide and Deep) surveys allow us to find cores of passive galaxies larger than 2 kpc up to redshift 1.         |

|**Abstract**|            To incorporate the gravitational influence of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) in planetary ephemerides, uniform-ring models are commonly employed. In this paper, for representing the KBO population residing in Neptune's 2:3 mean motion resonance (MMR), known as the Plutinos, we introduce a three-arc model by considering their resonant characteristics. Each `arc' refers to a segment of the uniform ring and comprises an appropriate number of point masses. Then the total perturbation of Plutinos is numerically measured by the change in the Sun-Neptune distance ($\Delta d_{SN}$). We conduct a comprehensive investigation to take into account various azimuthal and radial distributions associated with the resonant amplitudes ($A$) and eccentricities ($e$) of Plutinos, respectively. The results show that over a 100-year period: (1) at the smallest $e=0.05$, the Sun-Neptune distance change $\Delta d_{SN}$ caused by Plutinos decreases significantly as $A$ reduces. It can deviate from the value of $\Delta d_{SN}$ obtained in the ring model by approximately 100 km; (2) as $e$ increases in the medium range of 0.1-0.2, the difference in $\Delta d_{SN}$ between the arc and ring models becomes increasingly significant; (3) at the largest $e\gtrsim0.25$, $\Delta d_{SN}$ can approach zero regardless of $A$, and the arc and ring models exhibit a substantial difference in $\Delta d_{SN}$, reaching up to 170 km. Then the applicability of our three-arc model is further verified by comparing it to the perturbations induced by observed Plutinos on the positions of both Neptune and Saturn. Moreover, the concept of the multiple-arc model, designed for Plutinos, can be easily extended to other MMRs densely populated by small bodies.         |

|| S. Godambe, et al. -- incl., <mark>M. Sharma</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            The radio galaxy NGC 1275, located at the central region of Perseus cluster, is a well-known very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emitter. The Major Atmospheric Cherenkov Experiment Telescope has detected two distinct episodes of VHE (E > 80 GeV) gamma-ray emission from NGC 1275 during 2022 December and 2023 January. The second outburst, observed on 2023 January 10, was the more intense of the two, with flux reaching 58$\%$ of the Crab Nebula flux above 80 GeV. The differential energy spectrum measured between 80 GeV and 1.5 TeV can be described by a power law with a spectral index of $\Gamma = - 2.90 \pm 0.16_{stat}$ for both flaring events. The broadband spectral energy distribution derived from these flares, along with quasisimultaneous low-energy counterparts, suggests that the observed gamma-ray emission can be explained using a homogeneous single-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. The physical parameters derived from this model for both flaring states are similar. The intermediate state observed between two flaring episodes is explained by a lower Doppler factor or magnetic field, which subsequently returned to its previous value during the high-activity state observed on 2023 January 10.         |

|| Y. Choi, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-05*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in ApJ. 21 pages, 12 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            We present 850 $\mu$m polarization observations of the IC 348 star-forming region in the Perseus molecular cloud as part of the B-fields In STar-forming Region Observation (BISTRO) survey. We study the magnetic properties of two cores (HH 211 MMS and IC 348 MMS) and a filamentary structure of IC 348. We find that the overall field tends to be more perpendicular than parallel to the filamentary structure of the region. The polarization fraction decreases with intensity, and we estimate the trend by power-law and the mean of the Rice distribution fittings. The power indices for the cores are much smaller than 1, indicative of possible grain growth to micron size in the cores. We also measure the magnetic field strengths of the two cores and the filamentary area separately by applying the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method and its alternative version for compressed medium. The estimated mass-to-flux ratios are 0.45-2.20 and 0.63-2.76 for HH 211 MMS and IC 348 MMS, respectively, while the ratios for the filament is 0.33-1.50. This result may suggest that the transition from subcritical to supercritical conditions occurs at the core scale ($\sim$ 0.05 pc) in the region. In addition, we study the energy balance of the cores and find that the relative strength of turbulence to the magnetic field tends to be stronger for IC 348 MMS than HH 211 MMS. The result could potentially explain the different configurations inside the two cores: a single protostellar system in HH 211 MMS and multiple protostars in IC 348 MMS.         |

|| K. Conger, et al. -- incl., <mark>L. Xie</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-05*|
|*Comments*| *21 pages, 11 figures. Resubmitted second time to ApJ with only minor revision requested*|
|**Abstract**|            Recent theoretical work and targeted observational studies suggest that filaments are sites of galaxy preprocessing. The aim of the WISESize project is to directly probe galaxies over the full range of environments to quantify and characterize extrinsic galaxy quenching in the local Universe. In this paper, we use GALFIT to measure the infrared 12$\mu$m ($R_{12}$) and 3.4$\mu$m ($R_{3.4}$) effective radii of 603 late-type galaxies in and surrounding the Virgo cluster. We find that Virgo cluster galaxies show smaller star-forming disks relative to their field counterparts at the $2.5\sigma$ level, while filament galaxies show smaller star-forming disks to almost $1.5\sigma$. Our data, therefore, show that cluster galaxies experience significant effects on their star-forming disks prior to their final quenching period. There is also tentative support for the hypothesis that galaxies are preprocessed in filamentary regions surrounding clusters. On the other hand, galaxies belonging to rich groups and poor groups do not differ significantly from those in the field. We additionally find hints of a positive correlation between stellar mass and size ratio for both rich group and filament galaxies, though the uncertainties on these data are consistent with no correlation. We compare our size measurements with the predictions from two variants of a state-of-the-art semi-analytic model (SAM), one which includes starvation and the other incorporating both starvation and ram-pressure stripping (RPS). Our data appear to disfavor the SAM, which includes RPS for the rich group, filament, and cluster samples, which contributes to improved constraints for general models of galaxy quenching.         |

|| A. Holdsworth, et al. -- incl., <mark>S. Kraus</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-05*|
|*Comments*| *accepted to ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            Classical Wolf-Rayet stars are descendants of massive OB-type stars that have lost their hydrogen-rich envelopes, and are in the final stages of stellar evolution, possibly exploding as type Ib/c supernovae. It is understood that the mechanisms driving this mass-loss are either strong stellar winds and or binary interactions, so intense studies of these binaries including their evolution can tell us about the importance of the two pathways in WR formation. WR 138 (HD 193077) has a period of just over 4 years and was previously reported to be resolved through interferometry. We report on new interferometric data combined with spectroscopic radial velocities in order to provide a three-dimensional orbit of the system. The precision on our parameters tend to be about an order of magnitude better than previous spectroscopic techniques. These measurements provide masses of the stars, namely $M_{\rm WR} = 13.93\pm1.49M_{\odot}$ and $M_{\rm O} = 26.28\pm1.71M_{\odot}$. The derived orbital parallax agrees with the parallax from \textit{Gaia}, namely with a distance of 2.13 kpc. We compare the system's orbit to models from BPASS, showing that the system likely may have been formed with little interaction but could have formed through some binary interactions either following or at the start of a red supergiant phase, but with the most likely scenario occurring as the red supergiant phase starts for a $\sim 40M_\odot$ star.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array observations of CO(8-7), (9-8), and (10-9) lines, as well as the underlying continuum for two far-infrared luminous quasars: SDSS J2054-0005 at $\rm z=6.0389$ and SDSS J0129-0035 at $\rm z=5.7788$. Both quasars were previously detected in CO (2-1) and (6-5) transitions, making them candidates for studying the CO Spectral Line Energy Distribution (SLED) of quasars at $z \sim 6$. Utilizing the radiative transfer code CLOUDY, we fit the CO SLED with two heating mechanisms, including the photo-dissociation region (PDR) and X-ray-dominated region (XDR) for both objects. The CO SLEDs can be fitted by either a dense PDR component with an extremely strong far-ultraviolet radiation field (gas density $ n_{\rm H} \sim 10^6 \, \rm cm^{-3}$ and field strength $G_0 \gtrsim 10^6$) or a two-component model including a PDR and an XDR. However, the line ratios, including \tir and previous \cii and \ci measurements, argue against a very high PDR radiation field strength. Thus, the results prefer a PDR+XDR origin for the CO SLED. The excitation of the high-J CO lines in both objects is likely dominated by the central AGN. We then check the CO (9-8)-to-(6-5) line luminosity ratio $r_{96}$ for all $z \sim 6$ quasars with available CO SLEDs (seven in total) and find that there are no clear correlations between $r_{96}$ and both \fir and the AGN UV luminosities. This further demonstrates the complexity of the CO excitation powered by both the AGN and nuclear star formation in these young quasar host galaxies.         |
