|**Abstract**| We present new catalogs of likely globular clusters (GCs) in 17 nearby spiral galaxies studied as part of the PHANGS-HST Treasury Survey. The galaxies were imaged in five broad-band filters from the near-ultraviolet through the $I$ band. PHANGS-HST has produced catalogs of stellar clusters of all ages by selecting extended sources (from multiple concentration index measurements) followed by morphological classification (centrally concentrated and symmetric or asymmetric, multiple peaks, contaminant) by visually examining the V-band image and separately by a machine-learning algorithm which classified larger samples to reach fainter limits. From both cluster catalogs, we select an initial list of candidate GCs to have $B-V \geq 0.5$ and $V-I \geq 0.73$~mag, then remove likely contaminants (including reddened young clusters, background galaxies misclassified by the neural network, and chance superpositions/blends of stars) after a careful visual inspection. We find that $\approx86$ % of the color-selected candidates classified as spherically symmetric, and $\approx68$ of those classified as centrally concentrated but asymmetric are likely to be GCs. The luminosity functions of the GC candidates in 2 of our 17 galaxies, NGC 628 and NGC 3627, are atypical, and continue to rise at least 1~mag fainter than the expected turnover near $M_V \sim -7.4$. These faint candidate GCs have more extended spatial distributions than their bright counterparts, and may reside in the disk rather than the bulge/halo, similar to faint GCs previously discovered in M101. These faint clusters may be somewhat younger since the age-metallicity degeneracy makes it difficult to determine precise cluster ages from integrated colors once they reach $\approx1$~Gyr. |

|**Abstract**| Type IIn supernovae (SNe) exhibit narrow hydrogen lines that arise from the strong interaction between ejecta and circumstellar material. It remains poorly understood, however, what progenitor stars give rise to these explosions. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of the progenitor and environment of the nearby Type IIn SN 2010jl. With newer images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, we confirm that the previously reported progenitor candidate is a blend of the progenitor itself and a field star cluster in its close vicinity. SN 2010jl has now become much fainter than the progenitor. The progenitor is very blue and luminous with an effective temperature of log $T_{\rm eff}/{\rm K}$=4.26$^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$ and a luminosity of log $L/L_{\odot}$ =6.52$^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$. It is located in a very young star-forming region, but its luminosity is much higher than that expected from the environmental stellar populations. We suggest that the progenitor was in outburst when observed. Its nature and evolutionary history remain to be investigated. |
