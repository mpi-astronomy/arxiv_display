|**Abstract**|            We present a study of the molecular gas in five closely-spaced ($R_{\perp}<20$ kpc) dual quasars ($L_{\rm bol}\gtrsim10^{44}~\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$) at redshifts $0.4<z<0.8$ with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The dual quasar phase represents a distinctive stage during the interaction between two galaxies for investigating quasar fueling and feedback effects on the gas reservoir. The dual quasars were selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program, with confirmatory spectroscopic validation. Based on the detection of the CO J=2--1 emission line with Band 4, we derived key properties including CO luminosities, line widths, and molecular gas masses for these systems. Among the ten quasars of the five pairs, eight have line detections exceeding $5\sigma$. The detected sources prominently harbor substantial molecular gas reservoirs, with molecular gas masses ($M_{\text{molgas}}$) between $10^{9.6-10.5}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, and molecular gas-to-stellar mass ratios ($\mu_{\text{molgas}}$) spanning $18-97\%$. The overall $\mu_{\text{molgas}}$ of these dual quasars agrees with that of inactive star-forming main-sequence galaxies at comparable redshifts, indicating no clear evidence of quenching. However, intriguing features in each individual system show possible evidence of AGN feedback, matter transfer, and compaction processes.         |

|**Abstract**|            Understanding the surface temperature and interior structure of cold-to-temperate sub-Neptunes is critical for assessing their habitability, yet direct observations are challenging. In this study, we investigate the impact of water condensation on the atmospheric compositions of sub-Neptunes, focusing on the implications for JWST spectroscopic observations. By modeling the atmospheric photochemistry of two canonical sub-Neptunes, K2-18 b and LHS 1140 b, both with and without water condensation and with and without thick atmospheres, we demonstrate that water condensation can significantly affect the predicted atmospheric compositions. This effect is driven by oxygen depletion from the condensation of water vapor and primarily manifests as an increase in the C/O ratio within the photochemically active regions of the atmosphere. This change in composition particularly affects planets with thin H$_2$-dominated atmospheres, leading to a transition in dominant nitrogen and carbon carriers from N$_2$ and oxygen-rich species like CO/CO$_2$ towards heavier hydrocarbons and nitriles. While our models do not fully account for the loss mechanisms of these higher-order species, such molecules can go on to form more refractory molecules or hazes. Planets with thin H2-rich atmospheres undergoing significant water condensation are thus likely to exhibit very hazy atmospheres. The relatively flat JWST spectra observed for LHS 1140 b could be consistent with such a scenario, suggesting a shallow surface with extensive water condensation or a high atmospheric C/O ratio. Conversely, the JWST observations of K2-18 b are better aligned with a volatile-rich mini-Neptune with a thick atmosphere.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Galactic disk is one of the main components of the Milky Way, which contributes most of the luminosity. Its structure is essential for understanding the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. Using 174,443 K-type dwarf stars observed by both LAMOST and Gaia DR3, we study the disk density profile in the local volume within 1,200 pc. In the azimuthal dimension, we find strong asymmetric signal of the thin disk. The surface density and the scale height of the southern disk significantly change versus the azimuthal angle at the same galactocentric distance $R$. Meanwhile, in the vertical dimension, the scale height of the northern disk has quite different trend than that of the southern one. The scale height of the southern disk shows a decreasing trend with $\phi\sim-2.5^\circ$, and change to an increasing one with $\phi\sim5.0^Â°$. Meanwhile, the scale height of the northern disk has a consistently smaller increase. Finally, we divide the entire sample into three subsamples based on metallicity and all three subsamples show significant non-axisymmetric and north-south asymmetric signals in the Galactic disk. Furthermore, we find that the scale height of the metal-poor ([Fe/H] $<$ -0.4 dex) subsample in the northern disk is greater than that of the metal-rich ([Fe/H] $>$ -0.1 dex) subsample. However, in the southern disk, the scale height exhibits varying relationships across different metallicity slices.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report results from 8 hours of JWST/MIRI LRS spectroscopic monitoring directly followed by 7 hours of JWST/NIRSpec prism spectroscopic monitoring of the benchmark binary brown dwarf WISE 1049AB, the closest, brightest brown dwarfs known. We find water, methane, and CO absorption features in both components, including the 3.3 $\mu$m methane absorption feature and a tentative detection of small grain ($<$ 1$\mu$m) silicate absorption at $>$8.5 $\mu$m in WISE 1049A. Both components vary significantly ($>$1$\%$), with WISE 1049B displaying larger variations than WISE 1049A. Using K-means clustering, we find three main transition points in wavelength for both components of the binary: 1) change in behavior at $\sim$2.3 $\mu$m coincident with a CO absorption bandhead, 2) change in behavior at 4.2 $\mu$m, close to the CO fundamental band at $\lambda >$ 4.4 $\mu$m, and 3) change in behavior at 8.3-8.5 $\mu$m, potentially corresponding to silicate absorption. We interpret the lightcurves observed with both NIRSpec and MIRI as likely stemming from 1) a deep pressure level driving the double-peaked variability seen in WISE 1049B at wavelengths $<$2.3 $\mu$m and $>$8.5 $\mu$m, 2) an intermediate pressure level shaping the lightcurve morphology between 2.3 and 4.2 $\mu$m, and 3) a higher-altitude pressure level producing single-peaked and plateaued lightcurve behavior between 4.2 and 8.5 $\mu$m.         |
