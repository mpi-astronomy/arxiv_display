|**Abstract**| The neutral hydrogen 21 cm line is an excellent tracer of the atomic interstellar medium in the cold and the warm phases. Combined 21 cm emission and absorption observations are very useful to study the properties of the gas over a wide range of density and temperature. In this work, we have used 21 cm absorption spectra from recent interferometric surveys, along with the corresponding emission spectra from earlier single dish surveys to study the properties of the atomic gas in the Milky Way. In particular, we focus on a comparison of properties between lines of sight through the gas disk in the Galactic plane and high Galactic latitude lines of sight through more diffuse gas. As expected, the analysis shows a lower average temperature for the gas in the Galactic plane compared to that along the high latitude lines of sight. The gas in the plane also has a higher molecular fraction, showing a sharp transition and flattening in the dust - gas correlation. On the other hand, the observed correlation between 21 cm brightness temperature and optical depth indicates some intrinsic difference in spin temperature distribution and a fraction of gas in the Galactic plane having intermediate optical depth (for 0.02 < $\tau$ < 0.2) but higher spin temperature, compared to that of the diffuse gas at high latitude with the same optical depth. This may be due to a small fraction of cold gas with slightly higher temperature and lower density present on the Galactic plane. |

|**Abstract**| We present ALMA sub-kpc- to kpc-scale resolution observations of the [CII], CO(9-8), and OH$^{+}$\,($1_{1}$--$0_{1}$) lines along with their dust continuum emission toward the FIR luminous quasar SDSS J231038.88+185519.7 at $z = 6.0031$. The [CII] brightness follows a flat distribution with a Sersic index of 0.59. The CO(9-8) line and the dust continuum can be fit with an unresolved nuclear component and an extended Sersic component with a Sersic index of ~1. The dust temperature drops with distance from the center. The effective radius of the dust continuum is smaller than that of the line emission and the dust mass surface density, but is consistent with that of the star formation rate surface density. The OH$^{+}$\,($1_{1}$--$0_{1}$) line shows a P-Cygni profile with an absorption, which may indicate an outflow with a neutral gas mass of $(6.2\pm1.2)\times10^{8} M_{\odot}$ along the line of sight. We employed a 3D tilted ring model to fit the [CII] and CO(9-8) data cubes. The two lines are both rotation dominated and trace identical disk geometries and gas motions. We decompose the circular rotation curve measured from the kinematic model fit to the [CII] line into four matter components (black hole, stars, gas, and dark matter). The quasar-starburst system is dominated by baryonic matter inside the central few kiloparsecs. We constrain the black hole mass to be $2.97^{+0.51}_{-0.77}\times 10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$; this is the first time that the dynamical mass of a black hole has been measured at $z\sim6$. A massive stellar component (on the order of $10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$) may have already existed when the Universe was only ~0.93 Gyr old. The relations between the black hole mass and the baryonic mass of this quasar indicate that the central supermassive black hole may have formed before its host galaxy. [Abridged version.

|*Appeared on*| *2022-10-24*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted to MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**| We use the SOUX sample of $\sim$700 AGN to form average optical-UV-X-rays SEDs on a 2D grid of $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ and $L_{2500}$. We compare these with the predictions of a new AGN SED model, QSOSED, which includes prescriptions for both hot and warm Comptonisation regions as well as an outer standard disc. This predicts the overall SED fairly well for 7.5<log($M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$)<9.0 over a wide range in $L/L_{\mathrm{Edd}}$, but at higher masses the outer disc spectra in the model are far too cool to match the data. We create optical-UV composites from the entire SDSS sample and use these to show that the mismatch is due to there being no significant change in spectral shape of the optical-UV continuum across several decades of $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ at constant luminosity. We show for the first time that this cannot be matched by standard disc models with high black hole spin. These apparently fit, but are not self-consistent as they do not include the General Relativistic effects for the emission to reach the observer. At high spin, increased gravitational redshift compensates for almost all of the higher temperature emission from the smaller inner disc radii. The data do not match the predictions made by any current accretion flow model. Either the disc is completely covered by a warm Comptonisation layer whose properties change systematically with $L/L_{\mathrm{Edd}}$, or the accretion flow structure is fundamentally different to that of the standard disc models. |

|**Abstract**| As one of the most commonly observed disk substructures, dust rings from high-resolution disk surveys appear to have different radial widths. Recent observations on PDS 70 and AB Aur reveal not only planets in the disk, but also the accompanying wide dust rings. We use three-dimensional dust-and-gas disk simulations to study whether gap-opening planets are responsible for the large ring width in disk observations. We find that gap-opening planets can widen rings of dust trapped at the pressure bump via planetary perturbations, even with the mid-plane dust-to-gas ratio approaching order unity and with the dust back-reaction accounted for. We show that the planet-related widening effect of dust rings can be quantified using diffusion-advection theory, and provide a generalized criterion for an equilibrated dust ring width in three-dimensional disk models. We also suggest that the ring width can be estimated using the gas turbulent viscosity $\alpha_{\rm turb}$, but with cautions about the Schmidt number greater than order unity. |

|**Abstract**| We present the results of the broadband X-ray spectral analysis of simultaneous NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of four nearby Compton-thick active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates selected from the Swift-Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) 150-month catalog. This work is part of a larger effort to identify and characterize all Compton-thick (NH >= 10^24 cm^-2) AGN in the local Universe (z < 0.05). We used three physically motivated models -- MYTorus, borus02, and UXClumpy -- to fit and characterize these sources. Of the four candidates analyzed, 2MASX J02051994-0233055 was found to be an unobscured (NH < 10^22 cm^-2) AGN, 2MASX J04075215-6116126 and IC 2227 to be Compton-thin (10^22 cm^-2 < NH < 10^24 cm^-2) AGN, and one, ESO 362-8, was confirmed to be a Compton-thick AGN. Additionally, every source was found to have a statistically significant difference between their line-of-sight and average torus hydrogen column density, further supporting the idea that the obscuring material in AGN is inhomogeneous. Furthermore, half of the sources in our sample (2MASX J02051994-0233055 and 2MASX J04075215-6116126) exhibited significant luminosity variation in the last decade, suggesting that this might be a common feature of AGN. |

|**Abstract**| Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) is a proposed modification for the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model motivated by small-scale discrepancies in low-mass galaxies. Composed of ultra-light (mass $\sim 10^{-22}$ eV) axions with kpc-scale de Broglie wavelengths, this is one of a class of candidates that predicts that the first collapsed objects form in relatively massive dark matter halos. This implies that the formation history of the first stars and galaxies would be very different, potentially placing strong constraints on such models. Here we numerically simulate the formation of the first stars in an FDM cosmology, following the collapse in a representative volume all the way down to primordial protostar formation including a primordial non-equilibrium chemical network and cooling for the first time. We find two novel results: first, the large-scale collapse results in a very thin and flat gas ``pancake"; second, despite the very different cosmology, this pancake fragments until it forms protostellar objects indistinguishable from those in CDM. Combined, these results indicate that the first generation of stars in this model are also likely to be massive and, because of the sheet morphology, do not self-regulate, resulting in a massive Pop III starburst. We estimate the total number of first stars forming in this extended structure to be $10^4$ over 20 Myr using a simple model to account for the ionizing feedback from the stars, and should be observable with JWST. These predictions provide a potential smoking gun signature of FDM and similar dark matter candidates. |

|**Abstract**| Magnetars are a special subset of the isolated neutron star family, with X-ray and radio emission mainly powered by the decay of their immense magnetic fields. Many attributes of magnetars remain poorly understood: spin-down glitches or the sudden reductions in the star's angular momentum, radio bursts reminiscent of extra-galactic Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), and transient pulsed radio emission lasting months to years. Here we unveil the detection of a large spin-down glitch event ($|\Delta\nu/\nu| = 5.8_{-1.6}^{+2.6}\times10^{-6}$) from the magnetar SGR~1935+2154 on 2020 October 5 (+/- 1 day). We find no change to the source persistent surface thermal or magnetospheric X-ray behavior, nor is there evidence of strong X-ray bursting activity. Yet, in the subsequent days, the magnetar emitted three FRB-like radio bursts followed by a month long episode of pulsed radio emission. Given the rarity of spin-down glitches and radio signals from magnetars, their approximate synchronicity suggests an association, providing pivotal clues to their origin and triggering mechanisms, with ramifications to the broader magnetar and FRB populations. We postulate that impulsive crustal plasma shedding close to the magnetic pole generates a wind that combs out magnetic field lines, rapidly reducing the star's angular momentum, while temporarily altering the magnetospheric field geometry to permit the pair creation needed to precipitate radio emission. |

|| Irina Zhuravleva, et al. -- incl., <mark>Congyao Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2022-10-24*|

|**Abstract**| While awaiting direct velocity measurement of gas motions in the hot intracluster medium, we rely on indirect probes, including gas perturbations in galaxy clusters. Using a sample of $\sim 80$ clusters in different dynamic states from Omega500 cosmological simulations, we examine scaling relations between the fluctuation amplitudes of gas density, $\delta\rho/\rho$, pressure, $\delta P/P$, X-ray surface brightness, Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) y-parameter, and the characteristic Mach number of gas motions, $M_{\rm 1d}$. In relaxed clusters, accounting for halo ellipticities reduces $\delta\rho/\rho$ or $\delta P/P$ by a factor of up to 2 within $r_{500c}$. We confirm a strong linear correlation between $\delta\rho/\rho$ (or $\delta P/P$) and $M_{\rm 1d}$ in relaxed clusters, with the proportionality coefficient $\eta \approx 1$. For unrelaxed clusters, the correlation is less strong and has a larger $\eta\approx 1.3\pm 0.5$ ($1.5\pm0.5$) for $\delta\rho/\rho$ ($\delta P/P$). Examination of the power-law scaling of $M_{\rm 1d}$ with $\delta\rho/\rho$ shows that it is almost linear for relaxed clusters, while for the unrelaxed ones, it is closer to $\delta\rho/\rho\propto M_{\rm 1d}^2$, supporting an increasing role of non-linear terms and compressive modes. In agreement with previous studies, we observe a strong correlation of $M_{\rm 1d}$ with radius. Correcting for these correlations leaves a residual scatter in $M_{\rm 1d}$ of $\sim 4 (7)$ per cent for relaxed (perturbed) clusters. Hydrostatic mass bias correlates with $M_{\rm 1d}$ as strongly as with $\delta\rho/\rho$ in relaxed clusters. The residual scatters after correcting for derived trends is $\sim 6-7$ per cent. These predictions can be verified with existing X-ray and SZ observations of galaxy clusters combined with forthcoming velocity measurements with X-ray microcalorimeters. |

|| Ramesh Mainali, et al. -- incl., <mark>Soniya Sharma</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2022-10-24*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in ApJ*|
|**Abstract**| We analyze spectra of a gravitationally lensed galaxy, known as the Sunburst Arc, that is leaking ionizing photons, also known as the Lyman continuum (LyC). Magnification from gravitational lensing permits the galaxy to be spatially resolved into one region that leaks ionizing photons, and several that do not. Rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectra from Magellan target ten different regions along the lensed Arc, including six multiple images of the LyC leaking region, as well as four regions that do not show LyC emission. The rest-frame optical spectra of the ionizing photon emitting regions reveal a blue-shifted ($\Delta V$=27 km s$^{-1}$) broad emission component (FWHM=327 km s$^{-1}$) comprising 55% of the total [OIII] line flux, in addition to a narrow component (FWHM = 112 km s$^{-1}$), suggesting the presence of strong highly ionized gas outflows. This is consistent with the high-velocity ionized outflow inferred from the rest-frame UV spectra. In contrast, the broad emission component is less prominent in the non-leaking regions, comprising $\sim$26% of total [OIII] line flux. The high ionization absorption lines are prominent in both leaker and non-leaker but low ionization absorption lines are very weak in the leaker, suggesting that the line of sight gas is highly ionized in the leaker. Analyses of stellar wind features reveal that the stellar population of the LyC leaking regions is considerably younger ($\sim$3 Myr) than the non-leaking regions ($\sim$12 Myr), highlighting that stellar feedback from young stars may play an important role in ionizing photon escape. |

|**Abstract**| The spectacular outbursts of energy associated with supernovae (SNe) have long motivated research into their potentially hazardous effects on Earth and analogous environments. Much of this research has focused primarily on the atmospheric damage associated with the prompt arrival of ionizing photons within days or months of the initial outburst, and the high-energy cosmic rays that arrive thousands of years after the explosion. In this study, we turn the focus to persistent X-ray emission, arising in certain SNe that have interactions with a dense circumstellar medium, and observed months and/or years after the initial outburst. The sustained high X-ray luminosity leads to large doses of ionizing radiation out to formidable distances. We provide an assessment of the threat posed by these X-ray luminous SNe by analyzing the collective X-ray observations from Chandra, Swift-XRT, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and others. We find that this threat is particularly acute for SNe showing evidence of strong circumstellar interaction, such as Type IIn explosions, which have significantly larger ranges of influence than previously expected, and lethal consequences up to $\sim$ 50 pc away. Furthermore, X-ray bright SNe could pose a substantial and distinct threat to terrestrial biospheres, and tighten the Galactic habitable zone. We urge follow-up X-ray observations of interacting SNe for months and years after the explosion to shed light on the physical nature of the emission and its full time evolution, and to clarify the danger that these events pose for life in our Galaxy and other star-forming regions. |

|*Appeared on*| *2022-10-24*|
|*Comments*| *20 pages, 13 figures, submitted to MNRAS. Comments welcome. Simulation movie available at this https URL*|
|**Abstract**| We simulate the formation and collapse of prestellar cores at few-AU resolution in a set of radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) using the grid-based code RAMSES-RT. We adopt, for the first time to our best knowledge, realistic initial/boundary conditions by zooming-in onto individual massive prestellar cores within the GMC. We identify two distinct modes of fragmentation: "quasi-spherical" and "filamentary". In both modes the fragments eventually become embedded in a quasi-steady accretion disk or toroid with radii ~ 500-5000 AU and opening angles $H/R \sim 0.5-1$. The disks/toroids are Toomre stable but the accreted pre-existing fragments are found orbiting the outer disk, appearing as disk fragmentation. Each core converts nearly 100 percent of the gas mass into a few massive stars forming near the disk center. Large and massive disks around high-mass stars are supported by magnetic pressure in the outer disk, at radii >200-1000 AU, and turbulent pressure in the inner disk. The most massive core accretes several times more mass than its initial mass, forming a (proto)star cluster of 8 massive stars enshrouded by a toroid, suggesting a competitive accretion scenario for ultra-high-mass star formation. We also find that the HII regions produced by a single massive star remain trapped in the dense circumstellar disks for a few hundred kiloyears, while the dynamic motions of massive stars in wide binaries or multiple systems displace the stars from the densest parts of the disk, allowing UV radiation to escape producing steady or pulsating bipolar HII regions. |

|*Appeared on*| *2022-10-24*|

|**Abstract**| We propose a novel subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) model that uses the virial mass of the main progenitor of each (sub)halo $M_{\rm prog}$ as a proxy of the galaxy stellar mass $M_*$ at the time of observation. This $M_{\rm prog}$ model predicts the two-point correlation functions depending on the choice of the epoch $z_{\rm prog}$ at which $M_\mathrm{prog}$ is measured. With $z_{\rm prog}$ as a fitting parameter, we apply the $M_{\rm prog}$ model to the latest observed angular correlation functions of galaxy samples at $z\simeq0.4$ with varying stellar mass thresholds from $M_{*,~{\rm lim}}/(h^{-2}M_\odot)=10^{11}$ to $10^{8.6}$. The $M_{\rm prog}$ model can reproduce the observations very well over the entire scale range of $0.1\textrm{--}10~h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. We find that, for the samples of $10^9\leq M_{*,~{\rm lim}}/(h^{-2}M_\odot)\leq10^{10.2}$, the correlation functions predicted by the widely-used $V_{\rm peak}$ model lacks amplitudes at the scale of $\lesssim1~h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, demonstrating the high capability of our $M_\mathrm{prog}$ model to explain observed clustering measurements. The best-fit $z_{\rm prog}$ parameter is highest ($z_{\rm prog}\simeq5$) for intermediate mass galaxies at $M_*\simeq10^{9.7}~h^{-2}M_\odot$, and becomes smaller towards $z_\mathrm{prog}\simeq1$ for both lower- and higher-mass galaxies. We interpret these trends as reflecting the downsizing in the in-situ star formation in lower-mass galaxies and the larger contribution of ex-situ stellar mass growth in higher-mass galaxies. |

|| J. Loreau, A. Faure, <mark>F. Lique</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2022-10-24*|
|*Comments*| *8 pages*|
|**Abstract**| We present the first set of rate coefficients for the rotational excitation of the 7 lowest levels of hydrogen fluoride (HF) induced by collision with water molecules, the dominant collider in cometary comas, in the 5-150 K temperature range. The calculations are performed with a quantum statistical approach from an accurate rigid rotor ab initio interaction potential. Rate coefficients for excitation of HF by electron-impact are also computed, within the Born approximation, in the 10-10,000 K temperature range. These rate coefficients are then used in a simplified non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) model of a cometary coma that also includes solar radiative pumping and radiative decay. We investigate the range of H2O densities that lead to non-LTE populations of the rotational levels of HF. We show that to describe the excitation of HF in comets, considering collisions with both water molecules and electrons is needed as a result of the large dipole of HF. |

|**Abstract**| The atmospheres of ultra hot Jupiters (UHJs) are prime targets for the detection of molecules and atoms at both low and high spectral resolution. We study the atmospheres of the UHJs WASP-121b and WASP-189b by performing 3D general circulation models (GCMs) of these planets using high temperature correlated-k opacity schemes with ultra-violet (UV) absorbing species included. The GCM results are then post-processed at low and high spectral resolutions and compared to available data. The high resolution results are cross-correlated with molecular and atomic templates to produce mock molecular detections. Our GCM models produce similar temperature-pressure (T-p) structure trends to previous 1D radiative-convective equilibrium models of UHJs. Furthermore, the inclusion of UV opacities greatly shapes the thermal and dynamical properties of the high-altitude, low-pressure regions of the UHJ atmospheres, with sharp T-p inversions due to the absorption of UV light. This suggests that optical wavelength, high-resolution observations probe a dynamically distinct upper atmospheric region, rather than the deeper jet forming layers. |

|**Abstract**| The angular-momentum distribution of classical Cepheids in the outer Milky Way disc is bi-modal with a gap at $L_\mathrm{gap}=2950\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{kpc}$, corresponding to $R=13\,\mathrm{kpc}$, while no similar feature has been found in the general population of disc stars. We show that star formation in multiple spiral arm segments at the same azimuth leads to such multi-modality which quickly dissolves and only shows in young stars. Unlike other explanations, such as a 1:1 orbital resonance with the Galactic bar, this also accounts for the observed steepening of the stellar warp at $L_\mathrm{gap}$, since the adjacent spiral arms represent different parts of the warped gas disc. In this scenario the gap is clearly present only in young stars, as observed, while most purely stellar dynamical origins would affect all disc populations, including older disc stars. |

|**Abstract**| NGC~6946, also known as the `Fireworks' galaxy, is an unusual galaxy that hosts a total of 225 supernova remnant (SNR) candidates, including 147 optically identified with high [SII]/Ha line ratios. In addition, this galaxy shows prominent HI holes, which were analyzed in previous studies. Indeed, the connection between SNRs and HI holes together with their physical implications in the surrounding gas is worth of attention. This paper explores the connection between the SNRs and the HI holes, including an analysis of their physical link to observational optical properties inside and around the rims of the holes, using new integral field unit (IFU) data from the Metal-THINGS survey. We present an analysis combining previously identified HI holes, SNRs candidates, and new integral field unit (IFU) data from Metal-THINGS of the spiral galaxy NGC 6946. We analyze the distributions of the oxygen abundance, star formation rate surface density, extinction, ionization, diffuse ionized gas, and the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich classification throughout the galaxy. By analyzing in detail the optical properties of the 121 previously identify HI holes in NGC 6946, we find that the SNRs are concentrated at the rims of the HI holes. Furthermore, our IFU data shows that the star formation rate and extinction are enhanced at the rims of the holes. To a lesser degree, the oxygen abundance and ionization parameter show hints of enhancement on the rims of the holes. Altogether, this provides evidence of induced star formation taking place at the rims of the holes, whose origin can be explained by the expansion of superbubbles created by multiple supernova explosions in large stellar clusters dozens of Myr ago. |

|**Abstract**| Using ion measurements from Ultra-Low-Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) observations onboard Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and Solar Isotope Spectrometer (SIS) observations onboard the Solar Terrestrial Observatory (STEREO)-A and STEREO-B spacecraft, we have identified 854 3He-rich time periods between 1997 September and 2021 March. We include all event types with observed 3He enhancements such as corotating interaction regions (CIRs), gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) events, interplanetary shocks, and impulsive SEP events. We employ two different mass separation techniques to obtain 3He, 4He, Fe, and O fluences for each event, and we determine the 3He/4He and Fe/O abundance ratios between 0.32 to 0.45 MeV/nucleon and 0.64 to 1.28 MeV/nucleon. We find a clear correlation in the 3He/4He and Fe/O abundance ratios between both energy ranges. We find two distinct trends in the 3He/4He vs. Fe/O relation. For low 3He/4He values, there is a positive linear correlation between 3He/4He and Fe/O. However, at 3He/4He ~ 0.3, Fe/O appears to reach a limit and the correlation weakens significantly. We provide a live catalogue of 3He rich time periods that includes the robust determination of the onset and end times of the 3He enhancements in SEP-associated periods for different types of events observed my multiple spacecraft. This catalogue is available for public use. New releases will follow after major additions such as adding new periods from new missions (e.g., Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter), identifying event types (impulsive SEP events, etc.), or adding new parameters such as remote observations detailing characteristics of the active regions. |
