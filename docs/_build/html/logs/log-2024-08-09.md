|**Abstract**|            MIRC-X and MYSTIC are six-telescope near-infrared beam (1.08-2.38 ${\mu}$m) combiners at the CHARA Array on Mt Wilson CA, USA. Ever since the commissioning of MIRC-X (J and H bands) in 2018 and MYSTIC (K bands) in 2021, they have been the most popular and over-subscribed instruments at the array. Observers have been able to image stellar objects with sensitivity down to 8.1 mag in H and 7.8 mag in K-band under the very best conditions. In 2022 MYSTIC was upgraded with a new ABCD mode using the VLTI/GRAVITY 4-beam integrated optics chip, with the goal of improving the sensitivity and calibration. The ABCD mode has been used to observe more than 20 T Tauri stars; however, the data pipeline is still being developed. Alongside software upgrades, we detail planned upgrades to both instruments in this paper. The main upgrades are: 1) Adding a motorized filter wheel to MIRC-X along with new high spectral resolution modes 2) Updating MIRC-X optics to allow for simultaneous 6T J+H observations 3) Removing the warm window between the spectrograph and the warm optics in MYSTIC 4) Adding a 6T ABCD mode to MIRC-X in collaboration with CHARA/SPICA 5) Updating the MIRC-X CRED-ONE camera funded by Prof. Kraus from U. Exeter 6) Carrying out science verification of the MIRC-X polarization mode 7) Developing new software for ABCD-mode data reduction and more efficient calibration routines. We expect these upgrades to not only improve the observing experience, but also increase the sensitivity by 0.4 mag in J+H-bands, and 1 mag in K-band.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a near infrared (NIR) candidate star cluster catalog for the central kiloparsec of M82 based on new JWST NIRCam images. We identify star cluster candidates using the F250M filter, finding 1357 star cluster candidates with stellar masses $>10^4$ M$_\odot$. Compared to previous optical catalogs, nearly all (87%) of the candidates we identify are new. The star cluster candidates have a median intrinsic cluster radius of $\approx$1 pc and have stellar masses up to $10^6$ M$_\odot$. By comparing the color-color diagram to dust-free yggdrasil stellar population models, we estimate that the star cluster candidates have A$_{\rm V}\sim3-24$ mag, corresponding to A$_{\rm 2.5\mu m}\sim0.3-2.1$ mag. There is still appreciable dust extinction towards these clusters into the NIR. We measure the stellar masses of the star cluster candidates, assuming ages of 0 and 8 Myr. The slope of the resulting cluster mass function is $\beta=1.9\pm0.2$, in excellent agreement with studies of star clusters in other galaxies.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report the discovery of the most eccentric transiting brown dwarf in the brown dwarf desert, TOI02490b. The brown dwarf desert is the lack of brown dwarfs around main sequence stars within $\sim3$~AU and is thought to be caused by differences in formation mechanisms between a star and planet. To date, only $\sim40$ transiting brown dwarfs have been confirmed. \systemt is a $73.6\pm2.4$ \mjupnospace, $1.00\pm0.02$ \rjup brown dwarf orbiting a $1.004_{-0.022}^{+0.031}$ \msunnospace, $1.105_{-0.012}^{+0.012}$ \rsun sun-like star on a 60.33~d orbit with an eccentricity of $0.77989\pm0.00049$. The discovery was detected within \tess sectors 5 (30 minute cadence) and 32 (2 minute and 20 second cadence). It was then confirmed with 31 radial velocity measurements with \feros by the WINE collaboration and photometric observations with the Next Generation Transit Survey. Stellar modelling of the host star estimates an age of $\sim8$~Gyr, which is supported by estimations from kinematics likely placing the object within the thin disc. However, this is not consistent with model brown dwarf isochrones for the system age suggesting an inflated radius. Only one other transiting brown dwarf with an eccentricity higher than 0.6 is currently known in the brown dwarf desert. Demographic studies of brown dwarfs have suggested such high eccentricity is indicative of stellar formation mechanisms.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present NIRSpec/MSA observations from the JWST large-area survey WIDE, targeting the rest-frame UV-optical spectrum of Ulema, a radio-AGN host at redshift z=4.6348. The low-resolution prism spectrum displays high equivalent width nebular emission, with remarkably high ratios of low-ionisation species of oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, relative to hydrogen; auroral O$^+$ emission is clearly detected, possibly also C$^+$. From the high-resolution grating spectrum, we measure a gas velocity dispersion $\sigma$~400 km s$^{-1}$, broad enough to rule out star-forming gas in equilibrium in the gravitational potential of the galaxy. Emission-line ratio diagnostics suggest that the nebular emission is due to a shock which ran out of pre-shock gas. To infer the physical properties of the system, we model simultaneously the galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) and shock-driven line emission under a Bayesian framework. We find a relatively low-mass, star-forming system (M* = 1.4$\times$10^{10} M$_\odot$, SFR = 70 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$), where shock-driven emission contributes 50 per cent to the total H$\beta$ luminosity. The nebular metallicity is near solar - three times higher than that predicted by the mass-metallicity relation at z=4.6, possibly related to fast-paced chemical evolution near the galaxy nucleus. We find no evidence for a recent decline in the SFR of the galaxy, meaning that, already at this early epoch, fast radio-mode AGN feedback was poorly coupled with the bulk of the star-forming gas; therefore, most of the feedback energy must end up in the galaxy halo, setting the stage for future quenching.         |

|**Abstract**|            Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs) are highly variable stars that possess gas- and dust-rich disks from which planets form. Much of their variability is driven by mass accretion from the surrounding disk, a process that is still not entirely understood. A multi-epoch optical spectral monitoring campaign of four CTTSs (TW Hya, RU Lup, BP Tau, and GM Aur) was conducted along with contemporaneous HST UV spectra and ground-based photometry in an effort to determine accretion characteristics and gauge variability in this sample. Using an accretion flow model, we find that the magnetospheric truncation radius varies between 2.5-5 R* across all of our observations. There is also significant variability in all emission lines studied, particularly Halpha, Hbeta, and Hgamma. Using previously established relationships between line luminosity and accretion, we find that, on average, most lines reproduce accretion rates consistent with accretion shock modeling of HST spectra to within 0.5 dex. Looking at individual contemporaneous observations, however, these relationships are less accurate, suggesting that variability trends differ from the trends of the population and that these empirical relationships should be used with caution in studies of variability.         |
