|**Abstract**|            Planets residing within the hot-Neptune Desert are rare, and studying their atmospheres can provide valuable insights into their formation and evolutionary processes. We present the atmospheric characterization of the first known ultra-hot Neptune, LTT-9779 b, using transmission spectroscopic observations obtained with the HST/WFC3 G141 and G102 grisms. Using the Iraclis pipeline and TauREx3 retrieval code, we find that LTT-9779 b likely possesses a H/He-dominated primary atmosphere with an opaque aerosol layer and the pure cloudy, flat-line model is rejected with approximately 2.7-$\sigma$ confidence. Although we do not find conclusive evidence supporting the presence of any molecular species, we place 95% confidence level upper limits on the volume mixing ratios (VMRs) of hydroxyl radical (OH) and iron hydride (FeH) at $7.18\times10^{-2}$ and $1.52\times10^{-8}$, respectively. Notably, the retrieval results are inconsistent with predictions from equilibrium chemistry models, which favor higher $\rm H_2O$ abundances over OH. This discrepancy suggests that disequilibrium processes, such as photochemistry or vertical mixing, may have altered the atmospheric composition. Comparisons between HST, Spitzer and JWST data reveal no evidence of temporal variations in the atmospheric composition of the terminator region. Our results highlight the need for higher-resolution spectroscopy and secondary eclipse observations to resolve LTT-9779 b's temperature-pressure (T-P) profile and chemical inventory definitively.         |

|| T. Wang, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-05-20*|
|*Comments*| *7 pages, 9 figures, 1 table. This article has been accepted by Review of Scientific Instruments. After it is published, it will be found at this https URL*|
|**Abstract**|            Seismic isolation is crucial for gravitational wave detectors as it minimizes ground vibrations, enabling the detection of faint gravitational wave signals. An active seismic isolation platform for precision measurement experiments is described. The table features piezo actuation along five degrees of freedom: three translational actuations and two tip-tilt degrees of freedom along the horizontal axes. It is stiff in rotation about the vertical axes. A seismometer is used to sense table motion. Piezo actuators are used to suppress seismic noise with feedback control bandwidth of 0.3 to 3 Hz. Suppression levels ranging from 21 to 36 dB of seismic noise within the frequency range of 0.5 to 1.3 Hz are demonstrated, as measured by a witness seismometer on the table, with the suppression direction along the axis of the longitudinal translation of the suspended mirror on the table. The suppression results in 1 $\mathrm{\mathrm{nm/\sqrt{Hz}}}$ residual horizontal motion at 1 Hz. Limitations such as tilt-to-translation coupling that prevent actuation over the desired range of 0.03 to 3 Hz are discussed.         |

|| P. Liu, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-05-20*|
|*Comments*| *14 pages + 3 pages of appendix, 12 figures in the main text. Accepted for publication in A&A*|
|**Abstract**|            Directly imaged exoplanets in wide orbits challenge current gas giant formation theories. They need to form quickly and acquire enough material before the disk dissipates, which cannot be accommodated by in-situ formation by core accretion. We search for wide separation ($>$ 100 au) planetary-mass companions with the Young Suns Exoplanet Survey (YSES). Here, we present a planetary-mass candidate companion discovered in the survey. We conducted follow-up observations of the candidate system after the first epoch observations and obtained six epochs of observations for this system between 2018 and 2024, and integral field spectroscopy of the stellar component. We report the detection of a candidate companion with H=22.04 $\pm$ 0.13 mag at a projected separation of 730 $\pm$ 10 au away from the primary star. High angular resolution imaging observations of the central star show it is a visual binary. Acceleration data, orbital fitting, spectral energy distribution fitting and radial velocity differences all suggest that there is at least one more unresolved low-mass stellar companion in this system. The planetary-mass candidate shows a significant proper motion comparable to that of the primary star. We estimate an age of 19-28 Myr for the primary star. We cannot confirm the companionship of the candidate due to the unknown barycentre of the stars. Long-term imaging and radial velocity monitoring of the central stars, along with spectroscopy of the candidate companion, are key to resolving the nature of this system. If confirmed, the candidate companion would have a mass of 3-5 Mj estimated with the ATMO evolutionary model. It would be another cold low-mass planet imaged similar to 51 Eri b and AF Lep b. Its extremely wide separation from the host star would challenge the formation theory of gas giant exoplanets.         |

|**Abstract**|            The $\Gamma$ growth model is an effective parameterization employed across various scientific disciplines and scales to depict growth. It has been demonstrated that the cosmic star formation rate density (CSFRD) can also be described broadly by this pattern, i.e. $\frac{dM(T)}{dT} = M_{z,0}\, \times \frac{\beta^{\alpha}}{\Gamma(\alpha)} \, T^{\alpha-1} e^{-\beta \, T }$ M$_{\odot}$ Gyr$^{-1}$, where $M_{z,0}$ is the stellar mass at $z$ = 0, $\alpha = 3.0$, $\beta = 0.5 $ Gyr$^{-1}$ and $T$ describes time. We use the identical $\Gamma$ growth pattern given by the CSFRD to extend the present day (z = 0) stellar mass bins $M_{\ast}(T)$ of the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) and investigate if we are able to reproduce observations for the high redshift GSMFs. Surprisingly, our scheme describes successfully the evolution of the GSMF over 13.5 Gyrs, especially for objects with intermediate and low masses. We observe some deviations that manifest {\it solely} at very high redshifts ($z > 1.5$, i.e. more than 9.5 Gyr ago) and {\it specifically} for very small and exceedingly massive objects. We discuss the possible solutions (e.g. impacts of mergers) for these offsets. Our formalism suggests that the evolution of the GSMF is set by simple (few parameters) and physically motivated arguments. The parameters $\beta$ and $\alpha$ are theoretically consistent within a multi-scale context and are determined from the dynamical time scale ($\beta$) and the radial distribution of the accreting matter ($\alpha$). We demonstrate that both our formalism and state-of-the-art simulations are consistent with recent GSMFs derived from JWST data at high redshifts.         |
