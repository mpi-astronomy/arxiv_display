|**Abstract**|            We investigate how the obscured IR-derived and the dust-corrected UV star formation rate functions (SFRFs) compare with each other, and with predictions from state-of-the-art theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution. We derive the IR-SFRF from the ALMA A$^3$COSMOS survey, by converting the IR luminosity functions (IR-LFs) into SFRF after correcting for AGN contribution. Similarly, we obtain the UV SFRFs from literature UV LFs, corrected for dust-extinction. First, we fit the two SFRFs independently via a MCMC approach, then we combine them to obtain the first estimate of the total SFRF out to $z \sim 6$. Finally, we compare this SFRF with the predictions of a set of theoretical models. We derived the UV (dust-extinction corrected, from literature UV-LFs) and IR SFRFs (from Herschel and ALMA IR-LFs) at $0.5 < z < 6$ , finding that they are mostly complementary, covering different ranges in star formation rate (SFR$ < 10-100$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the UV-corrected and SFR$ > 100$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the IR). From the comparison of the total SFRF with model predictions we find an overall good agreement at $z < 2.5$, with increasing difference at higher redshifts, with all models missing the galaxies that are forming stars with the highest SFRs. We finally obtained the UV (dust-corrected), IR and total star formation rate densities (SFRDs), finding that there are no redshift ranges where UV and IR alone are able to reproduce the whole total SFRD.         |

|**Abstract**|            Context. The spectral lines of the CH molecule are a key carbon (C) abundance diagnostic in FGKM-type stars. These lines are detectable in metal-rich and, in contrast to atomic C lines, also in metal-poor late-type stars. However, only 3D LTE analyses of the CH lines have been performed so far. Aims. We test the formation of CH lines in the solar spectrum, using for the first time, 3D Non-LTE (NLTE) models. We also aim to derive the solar photospheric abundance of C, using the diagnostic transitions in the optical (4218 - 4356 Å) and infrared (33025 - 37944 Å). Methods. We use the updated NLTE model molecule from Popa et al. (2023) and different solar 3D radiation-hydrodynamics model atmospheres. The models are contrasted against new spatially-resolved optical solar spectra, and the center-to-limb variation (CLV) of CH lines is studied. Results. The 1D LTE and 1D NLTE models fail to describe the line CLV, and lead to underestimated solar C abundances. The 3D NLTE modelling of diagnostic lines in the optical and IR yields a carbon abundance of A(C)=$8.52\pm0.07$ dex. The estimate is in agreement with recent results based on neutrino fluxes measured by Borexino. Conclusions. 3D NLTE modelling and tests on spatially-resolved solar data are essential to derive robust solar abundances. The analysis presented here focuses on CH, but we expect that similar effects will be present for other molecules of astrophysical interest.         |

|**Abstract**|            We have carried out unprecedentedly deep, nearly confusion-limited JCMT-SCUBA2 mapping observations on the nearest spiral galaxy, M31 (Andromeda). The 850 $\mu$m image with a $\sim$50 pc resolution yields a comprehensive catalog of 383 giant molecular clouds (GMCs) that are associated with the spiral arms. In addition, it unveiled a population of 189 compact inter-arm GMCs in M31, which are mostly unresolved or marginally resolved. The masses of all these GMCs are in the range of 2$\times$10$^4$ -- 6$\times$10$^6$ $M_{\odot}$; the sizes are in the range of 30--130 pc. They follow a mass-size correlation, $M$ $\propto$ $R_{c}$$^{2.5}$. The inter-arm GMCs are systematically less massive, more diffuse, colder, and have lower star-forming efficiency (SFE) than on-arm GMCs. Moreover, within individual spatially resolved on-arm and off-arm M31 GMCs, the SFE is considerably lower than the SFE in molecular clouds in main sequence and green valley galaxies. Follow-up investigations on M31 GMCs may provide clues for how star formation may be quenched in galactic environments. Finally, we reconstrained the dust opacity spectral index $\beta$ in the M31 galaxy by combining our new JCMT observations with archival Herschel and Planck data and found that the radial variation of $\beta$ may not be as large as was proposed by previous studies.         |

|**Abstract**|            Our knowledge of the chemical composition of the gas in the inner disc of intermediate-mass young stars is limited, due to the lack of suitable instrumentation. The launch of JWST has provided a significant improvement in our ability to probe gas in these inner discs. We analyse the gas composition and emitting conditions of the disc around HD 35929, a young intermediate-mass Herbig star, using MIRI/MRS data. Our goal is to constrain the chemistry and kinematics of the gas phase molecules detected in the inner disc. We use iSLAT to examine the observed molecular lines and DuCKLiNG to detect, fit, and analyse the molecular emission. We find gas phase H2O, CO, CO2, and OH in the disc, as well as HI recombination lines. Surprisingly, we also detect gas phase SiO in the fundamental v=1-0 vibrational band. We derive column densities and temperature ranges of the detected species, arising from the inner ~0.2 au, hinting towards a compact and very warm disc. The molecular column densities are much higher than found in lower mass T Tauri discs. In general, the molecular composition is consistent with an O-rich gas from which silicate-rich solids condense and the strong gas phase molecular line emission suggests a low dust opacity. The unexpected detection of gas phase SiO at the source velocity points to an incomplete condensation of rock forming elements in the disc, suggesting chemical disequilibrium and/or an underestimate of the gas kinetic temperature.         |

|**Abstract**|            Hot Jupiters are Jupiter-mass planets with orbital periods of less than ten days. Their short orbital separations make tidal dissipation within the stellar host especially efficient, potentially leading to a measurable evolution of the orbit. One possible manifestation of this is orbital decay, which presents itself observationally through variations in the orbital period and thus times of transit. Here we select four promising exoplanetary systems for detecting this effect: HIP 65, NGTS-6, NGTS-10 and WASP-173. We present 33 new transit light curves taken with the 1.54 m Danish Telescope, and analyse these alongside photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and transit timing data from the literature. We construct two ephemeris models for each target: a linear ephemeris and a shrinking orbital period due to tidal decay. The linear ephemeris is preferred for all four models - the highest significance for the quadratic ephemeris is 2 sigma for WASP-173. We compare these results to theoretical predictions for tidal dissipation of gravity waves in radiation zones, and find that wave breaking is predicted only in WASP-173, making rapid decay plausible in this system but unclear in the other three. The sensitivity of transit timings to orbital decay depends on the square of the time interval covered by available observations, so our results establish a useful baseline against which future measurements can be compared. NGTS-6 and NGTS-10 are important objects for future study as they are in the first field to be observed by the upcoming PLATO mission.         |

|**Abstract**|            Recognizing and addressing under-representation, exclusion, and problematic behavior within astronomy and astrophysics is crucial. In 2019, a survey was conducted at the Spirit of Lyot conference to evaluate the socio-demographics and well-being of the exoplanet and disk imaging community. This paper presents the results of a second survey, conducted at the 2022 Spirit of Lyot conference in Leiden, aiming to improve the evaluation of the community, expand diversity-related questions, and monitor the evolution of metrics since 2019. Sent to all participants, the survey received 96 responses. It measures respondents' visibility at conferences, recognition through publications and projects, experiences of disrespect or inappropriate behaviors as victims or witnesses, and identification as allies of minorities. These aspects were analyzed with respect to job position, expatriation, gender, belonging to another under-represented group (ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation), and parenthood.         |

|**Abstract**|            Protoplanetary disks observed in millimeter continuum and scattered light show a variety of substructures. Various physical processes in the disk could trigger such features -- one of which that has been previously theorized for passive disks is the thermal wave instability -- the flared disk may become unstable as directly illuminated regions puff up and cast shadows behind them. This would manifest as bright and dark rings, and a staircase-like structure in the disk optical surface. We provide a realistic radiation hydrodynamic model to test the limits of the thermal wave instability in irradiated disks. We carry out global axisymmetric 2D hydrostatic and dynamic simulations including radiation transport with frequency-dependent ray-traced irradiation and flux-limited diffusion (FLD). We found that starlight-driven shadows are most prominent in optically thick, slow cooling disks, shown by our models with high surface densities and dust-to-gas ratios of sub-micron grains of 0.01. We recover that thermal waves form and propagate inwards in the hydrostatic limit. In contrast, our hydrodynamic models show bumps and shadows within 30 au that converge to a quasi-steady state on several radiative diffusion timescales -- indicating a long-lived staircase structure. We find that existing thermal pressure bumps could produce and enhance this effect, forming secondary shadowing downstream. Hydrostatic models with self-consistent dust settling instead show a superheated dust irradiation absorption surface with a radially smooth temperature profile without staircases. We conclude that one can recover thermally induced flared-staircase structures in radiation hydrodynamic simulations of irradiated protoplanetary disks using flux-limited diffusion. We highlight the importance of modeling dust dynamics consistently to explain starlight-driven shadows.         |

|**Abstract**|            We use the first eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1) to investigate the contributions of AGN and extended gas to the total X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) of galaxy groups with different halo masses ($M_h$) at different redshifts. The presence of AGN in their central galaxies is identified using multi-wavelength catalogs, including the X-ray counterparts, the ASKAP radio catalog, and the DESI spectroscopic measurements. We apply the stacking method to obtain sufficient statistics for the X-ray surface brightness profile and the $L_X$ for groups with different central AGN properties. We find that the X-ray groups exhibit the highest $L_X$, followed by groups with QSO, radio, BPT-AGN, and non-AGN centrals. Moreover, the $L_X$ of the $M_h \lesssim 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot$ groups is dominated by the central AGN, while the X-ray emission from extended gas tends to be more prominent in the $M_h \gtrsim 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot$ groups. In groups where the AGN play a major role in X-ray emission, the contribution from extended gas is minor, resulting in significant uncertainties concerning the extended X-ray emission. When the subset containing the X-ray detected counterparts is excluded, the extended gas component becomes easier to obtain. A correlation has been identified between the X-ray luminosity of the central AGN and extended gas. However, once we account for the positional offset, their correlation becomes less prominent. Currently, the results are not conclusive enough to confirm whether there is a connection between the AGN feedback and extended gas. However, they provide a new perspective on the feedback processes in the history of group assembly.         |

|**Abstract**|            The soft X-ray telescope on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission, eROSITA (extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array), has produced the largest sample to date of galaxy groups and clusters detected via their intracluster/intragroup medium (ICM/IGrM) emission. Scaling relations between the intrinsic properties of these systems provide valuable insight into their formation and evolution. In this work, we investigate the scaling relations between key physical properties, such as soft band X-ray luminosity, temperature, gas mass, and the low-scatter mass proxy $Y_{\rm X}$, for the galaxy groups and clusters detected in the first eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1). Our analysis fully accounts for selection effects and the redshift evolution of the observable distributions. We construct a high-purity sample of $3061$ galaxy groups and clusters spanning the redshift range $0.05<z<1.07$ and mass range of $1.1\times10^{13}<M_{500}/$M$_{\odot}<1.6\times10^{15}$. This represents the largest sample to date used for scaling relation analysis. The selection function, derived from state-of-the-art simulations of the eROSITA sky, is rigorously incorporated into our modeling. We report best-fit parameters - normalization, slope, redshift evolution, and intrinsic scatter - for a set of scaling relations: $L_{\mathrm{X}}-T$, $L_{\mathrm{X}}-M_{\rm gas}$, $L_{\mathrm{X}}-Y_{\rm X}$, as well as the $M_{\rm gas}-T$ relation. Our best-fit models indicate that the slopes of the scaling relations deviate significantly from self-similar expectations, while the redshift evolution remains consistent with the self-similar model. The fits exhibit small statistical uncertainties, likely owing to the large sample size. Our results are in good agreement with previous observational studies that account for selection effects, as well as with simulations that incorporate non-gravitational physics.         |

|**Abstract**|            The ExoClock project is an open platform aiming to monitor exoplanets by integrating observations from space and ground based telescopes. This study presents an updated catalogue of 620 exoplanet ephemerides, integrating 30000 measurements from ground-based telescopes (the ExoClock network), literature, and space telescopes (Kepler, K2 and TESS). The updated catalogue includes 277 planets from TESS which require special observing strategies due to their shallow transits or bright host stars. This study demonstrates that data from larger telescopes and the employment of new methodologies such as synchronous observations with small telescopes, are capable of monitoring special cases of planets. The new ephemerides show that 45% of the planets required an update while the results show an improvement of one order of magnitude in prediction uncertainty. The collective analysis also enabled the identification of new planets showing TTVs, highlighting the importance of extensive observing coverage. Developed in the context of the ESA's Ariel space mission, with the goal of delivering a catalogue with reliable ephemerides to increase the mission efficiency, ExoClock's scope and service have grown well beyond the remit of Ariel. The ExoClock project has been operating in the framework of open science, and all tools and products are accessible to everyone within academia and beyond, to support efficient scheduling of future exoplanet observations, especially from larger telescopes where the pressure for time allocation efficiency is higher (Ariel, JWST, VLT, ELT, Subaru etc). The inclusion of diverse audiences in the process and the collaborative mode not only foster democratisation of science but also enhance the quality of the results.         |
