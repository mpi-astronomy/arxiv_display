|**Abstract**| Aims. We present high sensitivity and high-spectral resolution NOEMA observations of the Class 0/I binary system SVS13A, composed of the low-mass protostars VLA4A and VLA4B with a separation of ~90 au. VLA4A is undergoing an accretion burst that enriches the chemistry of the surrounding gas. This gives us an excellent opportunity to probe the chemical and physical conditions as well as the accretion process. Methods. We observe the (12K-11K) lines of CH3CN and CH313CN, the DCN (3-2) line, and the C18O (2-1) line toward SVS13A using NOEMA. Results. We find complex line profiles at disk scales which cannot be explained by a single component or pure Keplerian motion. By adopting two velocity components to model the complex line profiles, we find that the temperatures and densities are significantly different between these two components. This suggests that the physical conditions of the emitting gas traced via CH3CN can change dramatically within the circumbinary disk. In addition, combining our observations of DCN (3-2) with previous ALMA high-angular-resolution observations, we find that the binary system (or VLA4A) might be fed by an infalling streamer from envelope scales (~700 au). If this is the case, this streamer contributes to the accretion of material onto the system with a rate of at least 1.4x10-6 Msun yr-1. Conclusions. We conclude that the CH3CN emission in SVS13A traces hot gas from a complex structure. This complexity might be affected by a streamer that is possibly infalling and funneling material into the central region. |

|**Abstract**| We present a 6-D map of the Orphan-Chenab (OC) stream by combining the data from 5 years of Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey $S^5$ observations with Gaia EDR3 data. We reconstruct the proper motion, radial velocity, distance and on-sky track of stream stars with spline models and extract the stellar density along the stream. The stream has a total luminosity of $M_V=-8.2$ and an average metallicity of $[Fe/H]=-1.9$, similar to classical MW satellites like Draco. The stream shows drastic changes in its physical width varying from 200 pc to 1 kpc, a constant line of sight velocity dispersion of 5 km/s, but an increase in the velocity dispersion along the stream near pericenter to $\sim$ 10 km/s. Despite the large apparent variation in the stellar number density along the stream, the flow rate of stars along the stream is remarkably constant. We model the 6-D stream track by a Lagrange-point stripping method with a flexible MW potential in the presence of a moving extended LMC potential. This allows us to constrain the mass profile of the MW within the distance range 15.6 < r < 55.5 kpc, with the best measured enclosed mass of $(2.85\pm 0.1)\times10^{11}\,M_\odot$ within 32.4 kpc. With the OC stream's closest approach distance to the LMC of $\sim 21$ kpc, our stream measurements are highly sensitive to the LMC mass profile with the most precise measurement of the LMC's enclosed mass being at 32.8 kpc with $M=(7.02\pm 0.9)\times10^{10}\, {M}_\odot$. We confidently detect that the LMC DM halo extends to at least 53 kpc. The fitting of the OC stream allows us to constrain the past LMC trajectory and the degree of dynamical friction it experienced. We demonstrate that the stars on the OC stream show large energy and angular momentum spreads caused by the LMC perturbation and revealing the limitations of orbital invariants for substructure identification in the MW halo. |

|**Abstract**| The sudden release of magnetic energy on the Sun drives powerful solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The key issue is the difficulty in predicting the occurrence time and location of strong solar eruptions, i.e., those leading to the high impact space weather disturbances at the near-Earth environment. Solar radio imaging helps identify the magnetic field characteristics of active regions susceptible to intense flares and energetic coronal mass ejections. Mapping of the Sun at X-band (8.1 -- 9.3 GHz) with the 12-m radio telescope at the Arecibo Observatory allows monitoring of the evolution of the brightness temperature of active regions in association with the development of magnetic complexity, which can lead to strong eruptions. For a better forecasting strategy in the future, such ground-based radio observations of high-spatial and temporal resolution, along with a full polarization capability, would have tremendous potential not only to understand the magnetic activity of solar eruptions, but also for revealing the particle acceleration mechanism and additional exciting science. |

|**Abstract**| Changing-look (CL) AGN are unique probes of accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs), especially when simultaneous observations in complementary wavebands allow investigations into the properties of their accretion flows. We present the results of a search for CL behaviour in 412 Swift-BAT detected AGN with multiple epochs of optical spectroscopy from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS). 125 of these AGN also have 14-195 keV ultra-hard X-ray light-curves from Swift-BAT which are contemporaneous with the epochs of optical spectroscopy. Eight CL events are presented for the first time, where the appearance or disappearance of broad Balmer line emission leads to a change in the observed Seyfert type classification. Combining with known events from the literature, 21 AGN from BASS are now known to display CL behaviour. Nine CL events have 14-195 keV data available, and five of these CL events can be associated with significant changes in their 14-195 keV flux from BAT. The ultra-hard X-ray flux is less affected by obscuration and so these changes in the 14-195 keV band suggest that the majority of our CL events are not due to changes in line-of-sight obscuration. We derive a CL rate of 0.7-6.2 per cent on 10-25 year time-scales, and show that many transitions happen within at most a few years. Our results motivate further multi-wavelength observations with higher cadence to better understand the variability physics of accretion onto SMBHs. |

|**Abstract**| The Vera Rubin Observatory, set to begin observations in mid-2024, will increase our discovery rate of supernovae to well over one million annually. There has been a significant push to develop new methodologies to identify, classify and ultimately understand the millions of supernovae discovered with the Rubin Observatory. Here, we present the first simulation-based inference method using normalizing flows, trained to rapidly infer the parameters of toy supernovae model in multivariate, Rubin-like datastreams. We find that our method is well-calibrated compared to traditional inference methodologies (specifically MCMC), requiring only one-ten-thousandth of the CPU hours during test time. |

|**Abstract**| We present a multifrequency analysis of the radio galaxy 3CR 196.1 ($z = 0.198$), associated with the brightest galaxy of the cool core cluster CIZAJ0815.4-0303. This nearby radio galaxy shows a hybrid radio morphology and an X-ray cavity, all signatures of a turbulent past activity, potentially due to merger events and AGN outbursts. We present results of the comparison between $Chandra$ and VLT/MUSE data for the inner region of the galaxy cluster, on a scale of tens of kpc. We discovered H$\alpha$ + [N II]$\lambda6584$ emission spatially associated with the X-ray cavity (at $\sim$10 kpc from the galaxy nucleus) instead of with its rim. This result differs from previous discoveries of ionized gas surrounding X-ray cavities in other radio galaxies harbored in galaxy clusters and could represent the first reported case of ionized gas filling an X-ray cavity, either due to different AGN outbursts or to the cooling of warm ($10^4<T\leq10^7$ K) AGN outflows. We also found that the H$\alpha$, [N II]$\lambda\lambda6548,6584$ and [S II]$\lambda\lambda6718,6733$ emission lines show an additional redward component, at $\sim$1000 km$\,$s$^{-1}$ from rest frame, with no detection in H$\beta$ or [O III]$\lambda\lambda4960,5008$. We believe the most likely explanation for this redward component is the presence of a background gas cloud since there appears to be a discrete difference in velocities between this component and the rest frame. |

|**Abstract**| With the advent of high cadence, all-sky automated surveys, supernovae (SNe) are now discovered closer than ever to their dates of explosion. However, young pre-maximum light follow-up spectra of Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic), probably arising from the most stripped massive stars, remain rare despite their importance. In this paper we present a set of 49 optical spectra observed with the Las Cumbres Observatory through the Global Supernova Project for 6 SNe Ic, including a total of 17 pre-maximum spectra, of which 8 are observed more than a week before V-band maximum light. This dataset increases the total number of publicly available pre-maximum light SN Ic spectra by 25% and we provide publicly available SNID templates that will significantly aid in the fast identification of young SNe Ic in the future. We present detailed analysis of these spectra, including Fe II 5169 velocity measurements, O I 7774 line strengths, and continuum shapes. We compare our results to published samples of stripped supernovae in the literature and find one SN in our sample that stands out. SN 2019ewu has a unique combination of features for a SN Ic: an extremely blue continuum, high absorption velocities, a P-cygni shaped feature almost 2 weeks before maximum light that TARDIS radiative transfer modeling attributes to C II rather than H$\alpha$, and weak or non-existent O I 7774 absorption feature until maximum light. |

|**Abstract**| We use high resolution numerical simulations in order to analyze the stellar bar evolution in spinning dark matter (DM) halos. Previous works have shown that the halo spin has a substantial effect on the bar evolution and can lead to bar dissolution following the vertical buckling instability. Here, we invoke the DM spin sequence, $\lambda=0-0.09$, and study the effect of DM density along this $\lambda$-sequence by varying the compactness of DM halo. We find that (1) varying the DM density has a profound effect on the stellar bar evolution along the $\lambda$-sequence, namely, on its amplitude, pattern speed, buckling time, etc.; (2) For $\lambda\gtrsim 0.04$, the buckling instability has been delayed progressively, and does not occur when the bar has reached its maximal strength; (3) Instead, stellar bars remain near maximal strength, and their amplitude plateau stage extends over $\sim 1-7$ Gyr, terminating with the buckling instability; (4) Although stellar bars remain strong during the plateau, their pattern speed stays nearly constant. The reason for this unusual behavior of stellar bars follows from the highly reduced gravitational torques which they experience due to the DM bar being aligned with the stellar bar. The performed orbital analysis shows that the delayed buckling results from a slow evolution of stellar oscillations along the bar major and vertical axes -- thus postponing the action of the vertical 2:1 resonance which pumps the rotational energy into vertical motions; (5) Peanut/boxy shaped bulges form at the beginning of the plateau and grow with time; (6) Strong stellar bars in spinning halos can avoid fast braking, resolving the long standing discrepancy between observations and $N$-body simulations. This behavior of stellar bars along the $\lambda$- and DM density-sequences, reveals a wealth of stellar bar properties which require additional study. |

|**Abstract**| Deep generative models including generative adversarial networks (GANs) are powerful unsupervised tools in learning the distributions of data sets. Building a simple GAN architecture in PyTorch and training on the CANDELS data set, we generate galaxy images with the Hubble Space Telescope resolution starting from a noise vector. We proceed by modifying the GAN architecture to improve the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam ground-based images by increasing their resolution to the HST resolution. We use the super resolution GAN on a large sample of blended galaxies which we create using CANDELS cutouts. In our simulated blend sample, $\sim 20 \%$ would unrecognizably be blended even in the HST resolution cutouts. In the HSC-like cutouts this fraction rises to $\sim 90\%$. With our modified GAN we can lower this value to $\sim 50\%$. We quantify the blending fraction in the high, low and GAN resolutions over the whole manifold of angular separation, flux ratios, sizes and redshift difference between the two blended objects. The two peaks found by the GAN deblender result in ten times improvement in the photometry measurement of the blended objects. Modifying the architecture of the GAN, we also train a Multi-wavelength GAN with seven band optical+NIR HST cutouts. This multi-wavelength GAN improves the fraction of detected blends by another $\sim 10\%$ compared to the single-band GAN. This is most beneficial to the current and future precision cosmology experiments (e.g., LSST, SPHEREx, Euclid, Roman), specifically those relying on weak gravitational lensing, where blending is a major source of systematic error. |

|**Abstract**| Spicules are plasma jets, observed in the dynamic interface region between the visible solar surface and the hot corona. At any given time, it is estimated that about 3 million spicules are present on the Sun. We find an intriguing parallel between the simulated spicular forest in a solar-like atmosphere and the numerous jets of polymeric fluids when both are subjected to harmonic forcing. In a radiative magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulation with sub-surface convection, solar global surface oscillations are excited similarly to those harmonic vibrations. The jets thus produced match remarkably well with the forests of spicules detected in observations of the Sun. Taken together, the numerical simulations of the Sun and the laboratory fluid dynamics experiments provide insights into the mechanism underlying the ubiquity of jets: the nonlinear focusing of quasi-periodic waves in anisotropic media of magnetized plasma as well as polymeric fluids under gravity is sufficient to generate a forest of spicules on the Sun. |

|**Abstract**| Close encounters between two initially unbound objects can result in a binary system if enough energy is released as gravitational waves (GWs). We address the scenario in which such encounters occur in merging elliptical galaxies. There is evidence that elliptical galaxies can harbor intermediate-mass black holes. Therefore, these systems are potentially the breeding grounds of sources of gravitational waves corresponding to inspiraling compact objects onto a massive black hole due to the dynamics, the large densities, and the number of compact remnants they contain. We show that this process is efficient for intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with masses ranging from M $\in (10^3,10^5)$ M$_{\odot}$ and results in the formation of intermediate mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs). We consider a set of IMBHs and smaller black holes with masses $m_2 \in (10,10^3)$ M$_{\odot}$ to estimate the IMRI formation rate. We find rates ranging between 10$^{-8}$ yr$^{-1}$, and 10$^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$, and the IMRI formation rate per comoving volume in merging galaxies as a function of the redshift. The peak frequencies of the gravitational radiation emitted when these IMRIs are formed are within the detection band of space-borne detectors such as LISA and TianQin; taking into account the observable volume of these detectors, the total amount of IMRI detections per year is significant. |

|**Abstract**| Dual AGN are important for understanding galaxy-merger-triggered fueling of black holes and hierarchical growth of structures. The least explored type of dual AGN are those associated with mergers of two dwarf galaxies. According to observations and cosmological simulations, dwarf galaxies are the most abundant type of galaxies in the early Universe and the galaxy merger rate is dominated by dwarfs. However, these mergers are generally too distant to be directly observed, and low-redshift dwarf-dwarf merger-related dual AGN are notoriously hard to find. In this paper, we present the first results of our large-scale search for this elusive type of object and the first two candidates for dual AGN in dwarf-dwarf mergers. Both objects exhibit tidal features (tails and bridges) characteristic of galaxy mergers/interactions. One object is apparently in a late-stage merger with an AGN separation of < 5kpc, while the second is in an early-stage merger with interacting galaxies having established a tidal bridge. Both objects have dual, luminous X-ray sources that are most likely due to actively accreting massive black holes. Also, both objects have infrared counterparts, with colors consistent with being AGN. Follow-up observations will provide us a glimpse into key processes that govern the earliest phases of growth of galaxies, their central black holes, and merger-induced star formation. |

|**Abstract**| We introduce the PRISM interstellar medium (ISM) model for thermochemistry and its implementation in the RAMSES-RTZ code. The model includes a non-equilibrium primordial, metal, and molecular chemistry network for 115 species coupled to on-the-fly multifrequency radiation transport. PRISM accurately accounts for the dominant ISM cooling and heating processes in the low-density regime (i.e. $\rho<10^5\ {\rm cm^{-3}}$), including photoheating, photoelectric heating, H$_2$ heating/cooling, cosmic-ray heating, H/He cooling, metal-line cooling, CO cooling, and dust cooling (recombination and gas-grain collisions). We validate the model by comparing 1D equilibrium simulations across six dex in metallicity to existing 1D ISM models in the literature. We apply PRISM to high-resolution (4.5 pc) isolated dwarf galaxy simulations that include state-of-the-art models for star formation and stellar feedback to take an inventory of which cooling and heating processes dominate each different gas phase of a galaxy and to understand the importance of non-equilibrium effects. We show that most of the ISM gas is either close to thermal equilibrium or exhibits a slight cooling instability, while from a chemical perspective, the non-equilibrium electron fraction is often more than three times higher or lower than the equilibrium value, which impacts cooling, heating, and observable emission lines. Electron enhancements are attributed to recombination lags while deficits are shown to be due to rapid cosmic-ray heating. The PRISM model and its coupling to RAMSES-RTZ is applicable to a wide variety of astrophysical scenarios, from cosmological simulations to isolated giant molecular clouds, and is particularly useful for understanding how changes to ISM physics impact observable quantities such as metallic emission lines. |

|**Abstract**| Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) make up about 35 per cent of the more than 250 sources detected in very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays to date with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. Apart from four nearby radio galaxies and two AGNs of unknown type, all known VHE AGNs are blazars. Knowledge of the cosmological redshift of gamma-ray blazars is key to enabling the study of their intrinsic emission properties, as the interaction between gamma rays and the extragalactic background light (EBL) results in a spectral softening. Therefore, the redshift determination exercise is crucial to indirectly placing tight constraints on the EBL density and to studying blazar population evolution across cosmic time. Due to the powerful relativistic jets in blazars, most of their host galaxies' spectral features are outshined, and dedicated high signal-to-noise spectroscopic observations are required. Deep medium- to high-resolution spectroscopy of 33 gamma-ray blazar optical counterparts was performed with the European Southern Observatory New Technology Telescope, Keck II telescope, Shane 3-meter telescope and the Southern African Large Telescope. From the sample, spectra from 25 objects display spectral features or are featureless and have high signal-to-noise. The other eight objects have low quality featureless spectra. We systematically searched for absorption and emission features and estimated, when possible, the fractional host galaxy flux in the measured total flux. Our measurements yielded 14 firm spectroscopic redshifts, ranging from 0.0838 to 0.8125, one tentative redshift, and two lower limits: one at z > 0.382 and the other at z > 0.629. |

|**Abstract**| Empirical correlations between various key parameters have been extensively explored ever since the discovery of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and have been widely used as standard candles to probe the Universe. The Amati relation and the Yonetoku relation are two good examples, which have been paid special attention to. The former reflects the connection between the peak photon energy (Ep) and the isotropic $\gamma$-ray energy release (Eiso), while the latter links Ep with the isotropic peak luminosity (Lp), both in the form of a power law function. Most GRBs are found to well follow these correlations, but a theoretical interpretation is still lacking. Meanwhile, there are also some obvious outliers, which may be off-axis GRBs and may follow different correlations as compared with the on-axis ones. Here we present a simple analytical derivation for the Amati relation and the Yonetoku relation in the framework of the standard fireball model, the correctness of which are then confirmed by numerical simulations. The off-axis Amati relation and Yonetoku relation are also derived, which differ from the corresponding on-axis relation markedly. Our results reveal the intrinsic physics lying behind the radiation processes of GRBs, and highlight the importance of viewing angle in the empirical correlations of GRBs. |

|**Abstract**| One of the puzzles to have emerged from the Kepler and TESS missions is the existence of unexplained dips in the lightcurves of a small fraction of rapidly-rotating M dwarfs in young open clusters and star-forming regions. We present a theoretical investigation of one possible explanation - that these are caused by dust clouds trapped in the stellar magnetic fields. The depth and duration of the observed dips allow us to estimate directly the linear extent of the dust clouds and their distances from the rotation axis. The dips are found to be between 0.4-4.8%. We find that their distance is close to the co-rotation radius: the typical location for stable points where charged particles can be trapped in a stellar magnetosphere. We estimate the charge acquired by a dust particle due to collisions with the coronal gas and hence determine the maximum grain size that can be magnetically supported, the stopping distance due to gas drag and the timescale on which dust particles can diffuse out of a stable point. Using the observationally-derived magnetic field of the active M dwarf V374 Peg, we model the distribution of these dust clouds and produce synthetic light curves. We find that for 1 micron dust grains, the light curves have dips of 1% - 3% and can support masses of order of $10^{12}$kg. We conclude that magnetically-trapped dust clouds (potentially from residual disc accretion or tidally-disrupted planetesimal or cometary bodies) are capable of explaining the periodic dips in the Kepler and TESS data. |

|**Abstract**| The study on the dynamic evolution of young supernova remnants (SNRs) is an important way to understand the density structure of the progenitor's circumstellar medium. We have reported the acceleration or deceleration, proper motion and brightness changes of 260 compact radio features in the second youngest known SNR Cas A at 5\,GHz based on the VLA data of five epochs from 1987 to 2004. The radio expansion center locates at $\alpha(1950)=23^{\rm h}21^{\rm m}9^{\rm s}_{\cdot}7 \pm 0^{\rm s}_{\cdot}29, \delta(1950)=+58^{\circ}32^{\prime}25^{\prime\prime}_{\cdot}2 \pm 2^{\prime\prime}_{\cdot}2$. Three-quarters of the compact knots are decelerating, this suggests that there are significant density fluctuations in the stellar winds of the remnant's progenitor. We have verified that the acceleration or deceleration of compact knots are not related with the distribution of brightness. The brightening, fading, disappearing or new appearing of compact radio features in Cas A suggests that the magnetic field in the remnant is changing rapidly. |

|**Abstract**| SN 2018ivc is an unusual type II supernova (SN II). It is a variant of SNe IIL, which might represent a transitional case between SNe IIP with a massive H-rich envelope, and IIb with only a small amount of the H-rich envelope. However, SN 2018ivc shows an optical light curve evolution more complicated than canonical SNe IIL. In this paper, we present the results of prompt follow-up observations of SN 2018ivc with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Its synchrotron emission is similar to that of SN IIb 1993J, suggesting that it is intrinsically an SN IIb-like explosion of a He star with a modest (~0.5 - 1 Msun) extended H-rich envelope. Its radio, optical, and X-ray light curves are explained primarily by the interaction between the SN ejecta and the circumstellar material (CSM); we thus suggest that it is a rare example (and the first involving the `canonical' SN IIb ejecta) for which the multi-wavelength emission is powered mainly by the SN-CSM interaction. The inner CSM density, reflecting the progenitor activity in the final decade, is comparable to that of SN IIb 2013cu that showed a flash spectral feature. The outer CSM density, and therefore the mass-loss rate in the final ~200 years, is larger than that of SN 1993J by a factor of ~5. We suggest that SN 2018ivc represents a missing link between SNe IIP and IIb/Ib/Ic in the binary evolution scenario. |

|**Abstract**| A large-scale, horse-shoe-like filament was investigated and the magnetic field around it was reconstructed. This is an intermediate filament (IF) that appeared on the solar disk for the first time at 02:00 UT on 2015 November 7, and took 8 days to move to the central median on the solar disk. The active region AR 12452 around which the filament occurred was diffuse so that the magnetic field nearby was weak, the average field strength is 106 G. Therefore, the existing approaches to extrapolating the coronal magnetic field and to constructing the filament configuration in the region with strong background field do not work well here. On the basis of the regularized Biot-Savart laws method, we successfully constructed a data-constrained, non-linear force-free field configuration for this IF observed on 2015 November 14. The overall IF configuration obtained in this way matches well the morphology suggested by a 304~\AA \ image taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board Solar Dynamics Observatory. Magnetic dips in the configuration were coincident in space with the H$\alpha$ features of the filament, which is lower in altitude than the features seen in 304~\AA. This suggests that the cold plasma fills the lower part of the filament, and hot plasma is situated in the higher region. A quasi-separatrix layer wraps the filament, and both the magnetic field and the electric current are stronger near the inner edge of the filament. |

|**Abstract**| Context: The orientation and rotation of Mars, which can be described by a set of Euler angles, is estimated from radioscience data and is then used to infer Mars internal properties. The data are analyzed using a modeling expressed within the Barycentric Celestial Reference System (BCRS). Aims: We provide new and more accurate (to the $0.1$ mas level) estimations of the relativistic corrections to be included in the BCRS model of the orientation and rotation of Mars to avoid a misinterpretation of the data. Methods: There are two types of relativistic contributions in Mars rotation and orientation: (i) those that directly impact the Euler angles and (ii) those resulting from the time transformation between a local Mars reference frame and BCRS. The former correspond essentially to the geodetic effect. We compute them assuming that Mars evolves on a Keplerian orbit. As for the latter, we compute the effect of the time transformation and compare the rotation angle corrections obtained using realistic orbits as described by ephemerides. Results: The relativistic correction in longitude comes mainly from the geodetic effect and results in the geodetic precession (6.754mas/yr) and the geodetic annual nutation (0.565 mas amplitude). For the rotation angle, the correction is dominated by the effect of the time transformation. The main annual, semi-annual, and ter-annual terms have amplitudes of 166.954 mas, 7.783 mas, and 0.544mas, respectively. The amplitude of the annual term differs by about 9 mas from the estimate usually considered by the community. We identify new terms at the Mars-Jupiter and Mars-Saturn synodic periods (0.567 mas and 0.102 mas amplitude) that are relevant considering the current level of uncertainty of the measurements, as well as a contribution to the rotation rate (7.3088 mas/day). There is no significant correction that applies to the obliquity. |

|**Abstract**| This chapter of the Planetary Exploration Horizon 2061 Report reviews the way the six key questions about planetary systems, from their origins to the way they work and their habitability, identified in chapter 1, can be addressed by means of solar system exploration, and how one can find partial answers to these six questions by flying to the different provinces to the solar system: terrestrial planets, giant planets, small bodies, and up to its interface with the local interstellar medium. It derives from this analysis a synthetic description of the most important space observations to be performed at the different solar system objects by future planetary exploration missions. These observation requirements illustrate the diversity of measurement techniques to be used as well as the diversity of destinations where these observations must be made. They constitute the base for the identification of the future planetary missions we need to fly by 2061, which are described in chapter 4. Q1- How well do we understand the diversity of planetary systems objects? Q2- How well do we understand the diversity of planetary system architectures? Q3- What are the origins and formation scenarios for planetary systems? Q4- How do planetary systems work? Q5- Do planetary systems host potential habitats? Q6- Where and how to search for life? |
