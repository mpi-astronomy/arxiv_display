|**Abstract**|            The intracluster medium (ICM) today is comprised largely of hot gas with clouds of cooler gas of unknown origin and lifespan. We analyze the evolution of cool gas (temperatures $\lesssim10^{4.5}$ K) in the ICM of 352 galaxy clusters from the TNG-Cluster simulations, with present-day mass $\sim10^{14.3-15.4}\,{\rm M_\odot}$. We follow the main progenitors of these clusters over the past $\sim13$ billion years (since $z\lesssim7$) and find that, according to TNG-Cluster, the cool ICM mass increases with redshift at fixed cluster mass, implying that this cooler past of the ICM is due to more than just halo growth. The cool cluster gas at $z\lesssim0.5$ is mostly located in and around satellite galaxies, while at $z\gtrsim2$ cool gas can also accrete via filaments from the intergalactic medium. Lower-mass and higher-redshift clusters are more susceptible to cooling. The cool ICM mass correlates with the number of gaseous satellites and inversely with the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass. The average number of gaseous satellites decreases since $z=2$, correlating with the decline in the cool ICM mass over cosmic time, suggesting a link between the two. Concurrently, kinetic SMBH feedback shifts the ICM temperature distribution, decreasing the cool ICM mass inside-out. At $z\approx0.5$, the predicted MgII column densities are in the ballpark of recent observations, where satellites and other halos contribute significantly to the total MgII column density. Suggestively, a non-negligible amount of the ICM cool gas forms stars in-situ at early times, reaching $\sim10^{2}\,{\rm M_\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ and an H$\alpha$ surface brightness of $\sim10^{-17}\,{\rm~erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,arcsec^{-2}}$ at $z\approx2$, detectable with Euclid and JWST.         |

|**Abstract**|            Non-circular (NC) motions represent the imprints of non-axisymmetric structures in galaxies, providing opportunities to study the physical properties of gas departing from circular rotation. In this work, we have conducted a systematic study of the non-circular motions in a sample of 1624 gas-rich disk galaxies from the MaNGA MPL-11. By using the H$\alpha$ velocity as a tracer of the disk rotation, we find indications that the amplitude of the non-circular motions is related to the stellar mass, with the low mass and late-type galaxies the most affected. In our sample, we find ratios of circular to non-circular rotation ranging from 5% to 20%. By implementing harmonic models to include NC motions associated with spiral arms and stellar bars, we find that the rotational curves traced with H$\alpha$ are barely affected by the NC induced by these structures. Consequently, in our sample, we do not find evidence that NC motions contribute to the scatter of the stellar Tully-Fisher relation. Our results suggest that non-circular motions might have a more localized effect in galaxies rather than a global one.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2024-10-29*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            Understanding the complex ionization structure and chemical composition of \hii\ regions poses a significant challenge in astrophysics. The abundance discrepancy problem, characterized by inconsistencies between abundances derived from recombination lines (RLs) and collisionally excited lines (CELs), has long been a puzzle in the field. In this theoretical study, we present novel photoionization models that incorporate temperature, density, and chemical inhomogeneities within a single cloud to comprehensively address this discrepancy. By accounting for the intricate interplay between ionization, excitation, and chemistry, our models successfully reproduce both observed RLs and CELs with with an average difference between our models and the observations of 25% -- within uncertainties inherent in Galactic archival long-slit and new SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper observations. Through comparisons between generic inhomogeneous model predictions and observations, demonstrating the ability of our theoretical framework to analyze the abundance discrepancy problem within \hii\ regions. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating spatially resolved temperature, density, and chemical structures when interpreting the physical processes governing emission line spectra in these astrophysical environments.         |

|| Z. Wang, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-10-29*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            Tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling is expected to be one of the major noise sources in the interferometric phase readouts in TianQin mission. Arising from the angular motion of spacecraft (SC) and the onboard movable optical subassemblies (MOSAs), TTL noise needs to be removed in postprocessing after suppressing the laser phase noise with time-delay interferometry (TDI) technique. In this article, we show that we can estimate the TTL coupling coefficients using the null TDI channel {\zeta} and remove the TTL noise in the commonly used Michelson variables with the estimated coefficients. We introduce the theoretical model of TTL noise in TDI and consider linear drifts in the linear TTL coefficients for noise estimation and subtraction. The TTL coefficients with drifts are estimated successfully with an accuracy of 10 {\mu}m/rad in our numerical simulation. We discuss the impact of point-ahead angle compensation error and wavefront error, and find it necessary to estimate linear drift coefficients and quadratic TTL coefficients to keep TTL noise residuals below the 0.3 pm noise reference curve. However, the estimation accuracy suffers greatly from the correlation between yaw jitter measurements that contain the same SC jitter. Assuming all angular jitters induced by MOSAs are independent, choosing a frequency range with relatively higher MOSA yaw jitter noise levels is beneficial to the TTL coefficient estimation.         |

|| V. Hue, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            Observations of the Jovian upper atmosphere at high latitudes in the UV, IR and mm/sub-mm all indicate that the chemical distributions and thermal structure are broadly influenced by auroral particle precipitations. Mid-IR and UV observations have shown that several light hydrocarbons (up to 6 carbon atoms) have altered abundances near Jupiter's main auroral ovals. Ion-neutral reactions influence the hydrocarbon chemistry, with light hydrocarbons produced in the upper stratosphere, and heavier hydrocarbons as well as aerosols produced in the lower stratosphere. One consequence of the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is the existence of ionospheric jets that propagate into the neutral middle stratosphere, likely acting as a dynamical barrier to the aurora-produced species. As the ionospheric jets and the background atmosphere do not co-rotate at the same rate, this creates a complex system where chemistry and dynamics are intertwined. The ion-neutral reactions produce species with a spatial distribution following the SIII longitude system in the upper stratosphere. As these species sediment down to the lower stratosphere, and because of the progressive dynamical decoupling between the ionospheric flows and the background atmosphere, the spatial distribution of the auroral-related species progressively follows a zonal distribution with increasing pressures that ultimately produces a system of polar and subpolar hazes that extends down to the bottom of the stratosphere. This paper reviews the most recent work addressing different aspects of this environment.         |

|| Y. Zhao, <mark>J. Liu</mark>, Z.-Y. Zhang, T. G. Bisbas |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-10-29*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in ApJ; 18 pages, 2 tables and 8 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            In this paper we present a statistical study of the [C II] 158 $\mu$m line and the CO(1-0) emission for a sample of $\sim$200 local and high-$z$ (32 sources with $z>1$) galaxies with much different physical conditions. We explore the correlation between the luminosities of [C II] and CO(1-0) lines, and obtain a strong linear relationship, confirming that [C II] is able to trace total molecular gas mass, with a small difference between (U)LIRGs and less-luminous galaxies. The tight and linear relation between [C II] and CO(1-0) is likely determined by the average value of the observed visual extinction $A_V$ and the range of $G_0/n$ in galaxies. Further investigations into the dependence of $L_{\mathrm{[CII]}}/L_{\mathrm{CO(1-0)}}$ on different physical properties show that $L_{\mathrm{[CII]}}/L_{\mathrm{CO(1-0)}}$ (1) anti-correlates with $\Sigma_{\mathrm{IR}}$, and the correlation becomes steeper when $\Sigma_{\mathrm{IR}} \gtrsim 10^{11}$ $L_\odot\,\mathrm{kpc}^{-2}$; (2) correlates positively with the distance from the main sequence $\Delta(\mathrm{MS})$ when $\Delta(\mathrm{MS})\lesssim 0$; and (3) tends to show a systematically smaller value in systems where the [C II] emission is dominated by ionized gas. Our results imply that caution needs to be taken when applying a constant [[C II]-to-$M_{\mathrm{H_2}}$ conversion factor to estimate the molecular gas content in extreme cases, such as galaxies having low-level star formation activity or high SFR surface density.         |

|| Z. Liu, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. Lee</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-10-29*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted to ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            We present a joint analysis of high-resolution CO(2-1) and Paschen-$\alpha$ emission lines to trace gas dynamics and spatially resolved star formation in ASPECS-LP.3mm.06, a $z=1.1$ main sequence galaxy. Utilizing data from the ALMA and JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS), we explore both ionized gas and molecular gas within this galaxy. With a substantial molecular gas fraction (f$_\mathrm{mol}$ = 0.44 $\pm$ 0.02), ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 remains on the star-forming main sequence and adheres to the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, indicating typical gas-to-star conversion efficiency. Our analysis reveals extended structures across multiple wavelengths, suggesting regulated star formation within a stable disk. The spatially resolved star formation efficiency (SFE) and kinematic analysis indicate that ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 features a smooth mass assembly process across bulge and disk. Additionally, the galaxy exhibits modest dust extinction (A$_\mathrm{V}$ = 0.8), potentially linked to self-regulation during bulge formation. These findings position ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 as a prototypical galaxy, offering valuable insights into the mechanisms governing normal disk galaxy growth at z$\sim$1.         |

|| L. Shen, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-10-29*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            We investigated the pulsating behavior of KIC 10855535 using Kepler 4-year long cadence data. Two independent frequencies were detected: a pulsation frequency F0 = 17.733260(5)d-1 and a low frequency f8=0.412643(8)d-1 We identify F0 as the fundamental frequency, at which a equidistant quintuplet is centered, suggesting that the star orbits in a binary system. The fitted orbital parameters align well with those reported in previous literature. Long-term phase modulation caused by binarity has been confirmed by considering TESS light curve. Through adjusting light time via removing the light time effect, we measured a linear change in period of order $\dot{P}/P \simeq 1.44\times 10^{-7}yr^{-1}$, a value that could be indicative of stellar evolution. The star also exhibits a gradual and stable amplitude growth, thereby raising the possibility of structural changes during its evolution. We attributed f8 and its two harmonics to rotation and surface spots, with further analysis suggesting evolving characteristics over time. Based on the hypothesis, KIC 10855535 may rotate slowly for its type, with a speed of 37(2)km/s. Overall, KIC 10855535 presents an exceptionally clean spectrum and a relatively slow rotation as a {\delta} Sct pulsator, exhibiting a single pulsation mode that undergoes both amplitude and phase modulation.         |

|| X. Chen, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. Lee</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-10-29*|

|**Abstract**|            Powerful, galactic outflows driven by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are commonly considered as a main mechanism to regulate star formation in massive galaxies. Ultra- and hyper-luminous IR galaxies (U/HyLIRGs) are thought to represent a transition phase of galaxies from a rapidly growing period to a quiescent status as gas swept out by outflows, providing a laboratory to investigate outflows and their feedback effects on the hosts. In this paper we report recent Gemini and ALMA observations of a HyLIRG, J1126 at $z=0.46842$, which has been identified with a puzzling co-existence of a fast ionized outflow ($>2000$ km s$^{-1}$) and an intense starburst (star formation rate of 800 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). The Gemini observation shows the fast ionized outflow is extended to several kpc with a mass-loss rate of 180 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. A massive molecular outflow with a high mass-loss rate (2500 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) is revealed by ALMA. The multi-phase outflows show large factors of momentum boost and loading of kinetic power, indicating a driving by thermal pressure of a nuclear hot wind and/or radiation pressure of a highly obscured AGN. In addition to ejection of kinetic energy, it is also found that the powerful outflow can induce an ionizing shock in the galaxy disk and enhance the excitation and dissociation of molecular gas. The powerful outflow probably results in an instantaneous negative feedback and shows potential to regulate the host growth in a long term.         |

|| M.-L. Aru, et al. -- incl., <mark>A. Winter</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-10-29*|

|**Abstract**|            The evolution of protoplanetary disks in regions with massive OB stars is influenced by externally driven winds that deplete the outer parts of disks. These winds have previously been studied via forbidden oxygen emission lines, which also arise in isolated disks in low-mass star forming-regions (SFRs) with weak external UV fields in photoevaporative or magnetic (internal) disk winds. It is crucial to determine how to disentangle external winds from internal ones. Here, we report a proxy for unambiguously identifying externally driven winds with a forbidden line of neutral atomic carbon, [C i] 8727 A. We compare for the first time the spatial location of the emission in the [O i] 5577 A, [O i] 6300 A, and [C i] 8727 A lines traced by VLT/MUSE-NFM, with the ALMA Band 7 continuum disk emission in a sample of 12 proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We confirm that the [O i] 5577 A emission is co-spatial with the disk emission, whereas the [O i] 6300 A is emitted both on the disk surface and on the ionization front of the proplyds. We show for the first time that the [C i] 8727 A line is also co-spatial with the disk surface in proplyds, as seen in the MUSE and ALMA data comparison. To verify whether the [C i] 8727 A line is detected in regions where external photoevaporation is not expected, we examine VLT/X-Shooter spectra for young stars in low-mass SFRs. Although the [O i] lines are well detected in all these targets, there is <<10% detection rate in the case of the [C i] 8727 A line. This number increases substantially to a ~40% detection rate in sigma-Orionis, a region with intermediate UV radiation. The spatial location of the [C i] 8727 A line emission and the lack of its detection in isolated disks in low-mass SFRs strongly suggest that this line is a tell-trace tracer of externally driven photoevaporative winds, which agrees with recent excitation models.         |

|**Abstract**|            Context. Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are a source of very high energy (VHE) radiation that can reach up to TeV and even PeV energies. Our work uses the pulsar tree, a graph theory tool recently presented to analyze the pulsar population to select the candidates of interest. Aims. We aim to discover possible detectable PWNe. We also aim to test to what extent the pulsar tree groups detectable PWNe despite it considering only pulsars' intrinsic properties. Methods. We select four pulsars as candidates for TeV PWNe based on their positions in the pulsar tree. Using observed and assumed ranges of values for relevant parameters, we anticipate possible spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the PWNe of four pulsars (PSR J1208-6238, J1341-6220, J1838-0537, and J1844-0346) via a detailed time-dependent, leptonic model that was already found appropriate to describe almost all other detected nebulae. Results. We estimate the likelihood of detection for the four candidates studied by comparing the TeV fluxes predicted by the possible models with the sensitivities of different observatories. In doing so, we provide context for analyzing the advantages and caveats of the pulsar tree position as a marker for properties that go beyond the intrinsic features of pulsars that are considered in producing it.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Local Ultraviolet to Infrared Treasury (LUVIT) is a Hubble Space Telescope program that combines newly acquired data in the near ultraviolet (NUV), optical, and near infrared (NIR) with archival optical and NIR imaging to produce multiband panchromatic resolved stellar catalogs for 23 pointings in 22 low-mass, star-forming galaxies ranging in distance from the outskirts of the Local Group to ~3.8 Mpc. We describe the survey design, detail the LUVIT broadband filter observations and the archival datasets included in the LUVIT reductions, and summarize the simultaneous multiband data reduction steps. The spatial distributions and color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) from the resulting stellar catalogs are presented for each target, from the NUV to the NIR. We demonstrate in which regions of the CMDs stars with NUV and optical, optical and NIR, and NUV through NIR detections reside. For each target, we use the results from artificial star tests to measure representative completeness, bias, and total photometric uncertainty as a function of magnitude in each broadband filter. We also assess which LUVIT targets have significant spatial variation in the fraction of stars recovered at a given magnitude. The panchromatic LUVIT stellar catalogs will provide a rich legacy dataset for a host of resolved stellar population studies.         |
