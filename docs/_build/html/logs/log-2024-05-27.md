|**Abstract**|            The Orion Molecular Cloud complex, one of the nearest (D~400 pc) and most extensively studied massive star-forming regions, is ideal for constraining the physics of stellar feedback, but its ~12 deg diameter on the sky requires a dedicated approach to mapping ionized gas structures within and around the nebula. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V) Local Volume Mapper (LVM) is a new optical integral field unit (IFU) that will map the ionized gas within the Milky Way and Local Group galaxies, covering 4300 deg^2 of the sky with the new LVM Instrument (LVM-I). We showcase optical emission line maps from LVM covering 12 deg^2 inside of the Orion belt region, with 195,000 individual spectra combined to produce images at 0.07 pc (35.3 arcsec) resolution. This is the largest IFU map made (to date) of the Milky Way, and contains well-known nebulae (the Horsehead Nebula, Flame Nebula, IC 434, and IC 432), as well as ionized interfaces with the neighboring dense Orion B molecular cloud. We resolve the ionization structure of each nebula, and map the increase in both the [SII]/Ha and [NII]/Ha line ratios at the outskirts of nebulae and along the ionization front with Orion B. [OIII] line emission is only spatially resolved within the center of the Flame Nebula and IC 434, and our ~0.1 pc scale line ratio diagrams show how variations in these diagnostics are lost as we move from the resolved to the integrated view of each nebula. We detect ionized gas emission associated with the dusty bow wave driven ahead of the star sigma Orionis, where the stellar wind interacts with the ambient interstellar medium. The Horsehead Nebula is seen as a dark occlusion of the bright surrounding photo-disassociation region. This small glimpse into Orion only hints at the rich science that will be enabled by the LVM.         |

|**Abstract**|            Kpc-scale dual and offset Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are signposts of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) triggered during late-stage galaxy mergers, offering crucial insights into the coevolution of SMBHs and galaxies. However, robustly confirmed systems at high redshift (e.g., $z>1$) are scarce and biased towards the most luminous and unobscured systems. In this study, we systematically search for kpc-scale (projected separation $<15$ kpc) dual and offset AGNs around 571 moderate-luminosity, X-ray-selected AGNs including the obscured population, utilizing deep HST ACS/F814W and multiband JWST NIRCam imaging from the COSMOS-Web survey. We identify 59 dual and 30 offset AGN candidates in late stage major mergers based on spatially-resolved spectral energy distribution analyses. This translates to $\sim28$ and $\sim10$ bona-fide dual and offset AGNs using a probabilistic pair counting scheme to minimize chance superpositions. Notably, the fraction of dual and offset AGNs among moderate-luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}\sim10^{43}-10^{46}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}$), obscured AGNs is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of the most luminous, unobscured quasar pairs. We find tentative evidence for an increasing pair fraction among AGNs with redshift (from a few percent at $z\sim 0.5$ to $\sim22.9_{-17.7}^{+27.5}\%$ at $z\sim4.5$) and a higher occurrence rate of dual over offset AGNs. There is no pileup of dual/offset AGNs below $\sim 2~{\rm kpc}$ separations. These results generally align with predictions from the ASTRID and Horizon-AGN cosmological simulations when matching sample selection criteria, implying a high probability of both BHs being active simultaneously in late-stage major mergers.         |

|**Abstract**|            Detecting protoplanets during their formation stage is an important but elusive goal of modern astronomy. Kinematic detections via the spiral wakes in the gaseous disc are a promising avenue to achieve this goal. We aim to test the applicability to observations in the low and intermediate planet mass regimes of a commonly used semi-analytical model for planet induced spiral waves. In contrast with previous works which proposed to use the semi-analytical model to interpret observations, in this study we analyse for the first time both the structure of the velocity and density perturbations. We run a set of FARGO3D hydrodynamic simulations and compare them with the output of the semi-analytic model in the code wakeflow, which is obtained by solving Burgers' equation using the simulations as an initial condition. We find that the velocity field derived from the analytic theory is discontinuous at the interface between the linear and nonlinear regions. After 0.2 r$_p$ from the planet, the behaviour of the velocity field closely follows that of the density perturbations. In the low mass limit, the analytical model is in qualitative agreement with the simulations, although it underestimates the azimuthal width and the amplitude of the perturbations, predicting a stronger decay but a slower azimuthal advance of the shock fronts. In the intermediate regime, the discrepancy increases, resulting in a different pitch angle between the spirals of the simulations and the analytic model. The implementation of a fitting procedure based on the minimisation of intensity residuals is bound to fail due to the deviation in pitch angle between the analytic model and the simulations. In order to apply this model to observations, it needs to be revisited accounting also for higher planet masses.         |

|**Abstract**|            Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a ubiquitous component of the interstellar medium (ISM) in z~0 massive, star-forming galaxies and play key roles in ISM energy balance, chemistry, and shielding. Wide field of view, high resolution mid-infrared (MIR) images from JWST provides the ability to map the fraction of dust in the form of PAHs and the properties of these key dust grains at 10-50 pc resolution in galaxies outside the Local Group. We use MIR JWST photometric observations of a sample of 19 nearby galaxies from the "Physics at High Angular Resolution in Nearby GalaxieS" (PHANGS) survey to investigate the variations of the PAH fraction. By comparison to lower resolution far-IR mapping, we show that a combination of the MIRI filters (R$_{\rm{PAH}}$ = [F770W+F1130W]/F2100W) traces the fraction of dust by mass in the form of PAHs (i.e., the PAH fraction, or q$_{\rm{PAH}}$). Mapping R$_{\rm{PAH}}$ across the 19 PHANGS galaxies, we find that the PAH fraction steeply decreases in HII regions, revealing the destruction of these small grains in regions of ionized gas. Outside HII regions, we find R$_{\rm{PAH}}$ is constant across the PHANGS sample with an average value of 3.43$\pm$0.98, which, for an illuminating radiation field of intensity 2-5 times that of the radiation field in the solar neighborhood, corresponds to q$_{\rm{PAH}}$ values of 3-6%.         |
