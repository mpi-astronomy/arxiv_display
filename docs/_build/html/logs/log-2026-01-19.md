|**Abstract**|            Weak lensing surveys require accurate correction for the point spread function (PSF) when measuring galaxy shapes. For a diffraction-limited PSF, as arises in space-based missions, this correction depends on each galaxy SED. In the Euclid mission, galaxy SED reconstruction, a tasks of the photometric-redshift processing function (PHZ PF), relies on broad- and medium-band ancillary photometry. The limited wavelength sampling of the Euclid VIS passband and signal-to-noise ratio may affect the reconstruction accuracy and translate into biases in the weak lensing measurements. In this study, we present the methodology, which is employed in the Euclid PHZ PF, for reconstructing galaxy SEDs at 55 wavelengths, sampling the VIS passband every 10 nm, and we assess whether it fulfils the accuracy requirements imposed on the Euclid PSF model. We employ both physics- and data-driven methods, focusing on a new approach of template-based flux correction and Gaussian processes, and we introduce an SED metric whose bias propagates into PSF quadrupole moment errors. Our findings demonstrate that Gaussian processes and template fitting meet the requirements only in specific, but complementary, redshift intervals. We therefore propose a hybrid approach, which leverages both methods. This solution proves to be effective in meeting the Euclid accuracy requirements for most of the redshift range of the survey. Finally, we investigate the impact on the SED reconstruction of a new set of 16 evenly-spaced medium-band filters for the Subaru telescope, providing quasi-spectroscopic coverage of the VIS passband. This study shows promising results, ensuring accurate SED reconstruction and meeting the mission PSF requirements. This work thus provides not only the methodological foundation of galaxy SED reconstruction in the Euclid PHZ PF, but also a roadmap for future improvements using a new medium-band survey.         |

|**Abstract**|            Nearby galaxies exhibit a variety of structures, including central rings, similar to the MW Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). These rings are common in barred galaxies and can be gas-rich and highly star-forming. We aim to study molecular gas content and star formation rate of central rings within nearby galaxies and link them to global galaxy properties (e.g. bar morphology). We utilize $1\,$'' resolution CO(2-1) PHANGS-ALMA observations, visually identify 20 central rings and determine their properties. For $14$ rings, SFR surface density maps are available. We derive ring geometry, integrated molecular gas masses, SFRs, depletion times, and compare them to host galaxy and bar properties. Molecular gas is a good tracer for central rings: Previous studies used ionized gas and dust tracers to identify central rings in galaxies of similar morphological types as this study. In comparison, we find similar fractions of galaxies hosting central rings and similar radii distributions. The gaseous central rings have typical radii of $400_{-150}^{+250}\,$pc, molecular gas masses of $\log(M_\text{mol}/M_\odot){\sim}8.1_{-0.23}^{+0.17}$, and SFRs of $0.21_{-0.16}^{+0.15}\,M_\odot/\text{yr}$, thus contributing $5.6_{-2.1}^{+4.5}\,\%$ and $13_{-5}^{+10}\,\%$ to their host galaxies' molecular gas mass and SFR. The MW CMZ sits at the lower end of the radius, molecular gas mass, and SFR distribution, but it has a similar molecular gas mass and SFR fraction, and depletion time. Longer bars contain more massive molecular central rings, but we find no correlation between bar strength and the ring's molecular gas content. Although absolute central ring properties likely depend on host galaxy properties, the similarities between the MW CMZ and PHANGS central rings in relative parameters suggest that the processes of gas inflow and star formation are similar for central rings across nearby galaxies.         |

|| H. Yang, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-01-19*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in AJ*|
|**Abstract**|            We present observations and analysis of the bound planetary microlensing event KMT-2025-BLG-1616. The planetary signal was captured by the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) and the DECam Rogue Earths and Mars Survey (DREAMS). DREAMS's minute-cadence observations break the central/resonant degeneracy in the binary-lens models. The color of the faint source star ($I=22$) is measured from the DREAMS's $r - z$ color. The planetary system has a planet-host mass ratio of $q \sim 5 \times 10^{-4}$. A Bayesian analysis yields a host-star mass of $\sim 0.3\,M_\odot$, a planetary mass of $\sim 40\,M_{\oplus}$, a projected planet-host separation of $\sim 1.6~\mathrm{au}$, and a lens distance of $\sim 7.5~\mathrm{kpc}$. Based on the photometric precision achieved by DREAMS for this event, we simulate free-floating planet (FFP) detections and find that DREAMS is sensitive to Mars-mass FFPs in the Galactic bulge and Moon-mass FFPs in the Galactic disk.         |

|| <mark>Y. Wu</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-01-19*|
|*Comments*| *28 pages, 21 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            Cold Jupiters play a crucial role in planet formation and dynamical evolution. Since their initial discovery around 47 UMa, they have attracted significant interest, yet their formation mechanisms remain uncertain, underscoring the need to expand the known population. In this work, we combine RV data with Gaia astrometry using Hipparcos-Gaia proper-motion anomalies over a 25-year baseline. By jointly modeling both datasets with the MCMC framework, we constrain planetary masses, orbital inclinations, and three-dimensional orbital architectures. This reduces RV degeneracies and improves mass determinations. Four cold Jupiters are reported: HD 68475 b and HD 100508 b are each the first confirmed planet in their systems, with orbital periods $7832_{-323}^{+463}$ d and $5681\pm42$ d and dynamical masses of $5.16_{-0.47}^{+0.53} M_{\text{Jup}}$ and $1.2_{-0.18}^{+0.30} M_{\text{Jup}}$, respectively. In multi-planet systems, HD 48265 c has a period of $10418_{-1400}^{+2400}$ d and a mass of $3.71_{-0.43}^{+0.68} M_{\text{Jup}}$, while HD 114386 c orbits at $444.00_{-0.88}^{+0.93}$ d with a minimum mass of $0.37 \pm 0.03 M_{\text{Jup}}$. The two planets in the HD 48265 system may exhibit a significant mutual inclination, making it a target for testing the von-Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov mechanism. HD 68475 b is a promising candidate for future direct imaging with ELT/METIS. We identified a Jupiter analog with the longest known orbital period among planets with masses between 0.5 and 2 $M_{\text{Jup}}$, implying that a substantial population of cold Jupiters likely awaits discovery by Gaia. This study expands the sample of cold Jupiters with constrained orbits and dynamical masses, demonstrating the value of combining radial velocity and astrometry in exoplanet research.         |
