|**Abstract**|            The formation and migration history of a planet is expected to be imprinted in its atmosphere, in particular its carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio and metallicity. The BOWIE-ALIGN programme is performing a comparative study of JWST spectra of four aligned and four misaligned hot Jupiters, with the aim of characterising their atmospheres and corroborating the link between the observables and the formation history. In this work, we present the $2.8-5.2$ micron transmission spectrum of TrES-4b, a hot Jupiter with an orbit aligned with the rotation axis of its F-type host star. Using free chemistry atmospheric retrievals, we report a confident detection of H$_2$O at an abundance of $\log X_\mathrm{H_2O}=-2.98^{+0.68}_{-0.73}$ at a significance of $8.4\sigma$. We also find evidence for CO and small amounts of CO$_2$, retrieving abundances $\log X_\mathrm{CO}= -3.76^{+0.89}_{-1.01}$ and $\log X_\mathrm{CO_2}= -6.86^{+0.62}_{-0.65}$ ($3.1\sigma$ and $4.0\sigma$ respectively). The observations are consistent with the the atmosphere being in chemical equilibrium; our retrievals yield $\mathrm{C/O}$ between $0.30-0.42$ and constrain the atmospheric metallicity to the range $0.4-0.7\times$ solar. The inferred sub-stellar properties (C/O and metallicity) challenge traditional models, and could have arisen from an oxygen-rich gas accretion scenario, or a combination of low-metallicity gas and carbon-poor solid accretion.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present JWST NIRSpec spectro-imaging observations of jets from four edge-on protoplanetary disks that exhibit clear signatures of MHD disk winds. Bipolar jets are detected and spatially resolved in over 30 shock-excited forbidden lines, multiple Paschen and Brackett series lines of atomic hydrogen, and the high-energy excitation line of atomic helium (1.083 um). This helium line is the brightest jet-tracer towards HH 30 and FS TauB, which also exhibit asymmetric intensity between their red- and blue-shifted lobes in all tracers, including the [Fe II] and [He I] lines. Extinction maps reveal no significant differences across the lobes, suggesting an asymmetric jet-launching mechanism rather than environmental effects. Diagnostic line ratios yield consistent shock speeds of 50-60 km/s, jet ionization fractions of 0.1-0.2, and pre-shock electron densities of 1000 /cm^3. Combined with pixel-by-pixel electron density maps and [Fe II] line luminosities, we estimate jet mass-loss rates using three independent methods, averaging around a few 10^(-9) solar masses/yr. We estimate the accretion rates for these sources as 10 times the jet mass loss rates and find them to match well with the independently derived accretion estimates of other Class II sources in the Taurus star-forming region. Owing to JWST's high precision, we also investigate jet wiggling and find Tau 042021 to showcase the perfect case of mirror-symmetric wiggling, which can only be explained by the motion of the jet source around a stellar companion. Modeling this wiggling suggests Tau 042021 to host 0.33 and 0.07 solar masses binary at the center with binary separation of 1.35 au and an orbital period of 2.5 years.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is measured to form stars 10 times less efficiently than in the Galactic disk, based on emission from high-mass stars. However, the CMZ's low-mass protostellar population, which accounts for most of the initial stellar mass budget and star formation rate (SFR), is poorly constrained observationally due to limited sensitivity and resolution. We present the Dual-band Unified Exploration of Three CMZ Clouds (DUET) survey, targeting the 20 km/s Cloud, Sgr C, and Dust Ridge cloud e using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 1.3 and 3 mm. The mosaicked observations achieve a comparable resolution of 0.2-0.3" (~1600-2500 au) and a sky coverage of 8.3-10.4 square arcmin, respectively. We report 563 continuum sources at 1.3 mm and 330 at 3 mm, respectively, and a dual-band catalog with 450 continuum sources. These sources are marginally resolved at the 2,000 au resolution. We find a cloud-wide deviation (>70%) from commonly-used dust modified blackbody (MBB) models, characterized by either low spectral indices or low brightness temperatures. Three possible explanations for the deviation are discussed. (1) Optically thick Class 0/I Young stellar objects (YSOs) with very small beam filling factors can lead to lower brightness temperatures than what MBB models predict. (2) Large (mm/cm-sized) dust grains have more significant self-scattering, and therefore frequency-dependent albedo could cause lower spectral indices. (3) Free-free emission over 30 uJy can severely contaminate dust emission and cause low spectral indices for mJy sources in our sample, although the needed number of massive protostars (embedded UCHII regions) is infeasibly high for the normal stellar initial mass function. A reliable measurement of the SFR at low protostellar masses will require future work to distinguish between these possible explanations.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present high-angular resolution (0.068", ~400pc) ALMA imaging of the [CII] line and dust continuum emission of PSO J352.4034-15.3373, a radio-loud quasar at z=5.83. The observations reveal a remarkably close match between the orientation of the [CII] and thermal dust emission mapped by ALMA, and radio synchrotron emission of a radio jet previously mapped by the VLBA. This narrow alignment extends over ~4kpc, reminiscent of the well-studied 'alignment effect' in lower-redshift radio galaxies. The [CII] kinematics show a linear increase in velocity with galactocentric radii up to ~200 km/s at r=2kpc, consistent with bulk motions within the galaxy potential, and not relativistic jet motions. The kinematics and respective morphologies are consistent with a picture in which the relativistic jet injects energy into the interstellar medium (potentially leading to subsequent star formation), giving rise to the observed alignment and significant (> 100 km/s) [CII] velocity dispersion within the host galaxy on kiloparsec scales. Indeed, the astonishingly close alignment and narrow linearity of the radio jet with the [CII] and dust emission are hard to conceive without some fundamental relationship between the two.         |
