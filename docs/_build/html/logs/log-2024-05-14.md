|**Abstract**|            With a growing sample of fast radio bursts (FRBs), we investigate the energy budget of different power sources within the framework of magnetar starquake triggering mechanism. During a starquake, the energy can be released in any form through magnetic, strain, rotational, and gravitational energies. Following findings are revealed: 1. The crust can store a free magnetic energy of the amount of at least $6.3\times10^{46}$ erg via toroidal fields, with frequent starquakes happening due to the instability of the crust. 2. The strain energy develops as a rigid object spins down, which can be released during a global starquake accompanied by a glitch. However, it takes a long time to accumulate enough strain energy via spin-down. 3. The rotational energy of a magnetar with $P\lesssim0.1\rm\,s$ can match the energy and luminosity budget of FRBs. 4. The budget of the total gravitational energy is high, but the mechanism and efficiency of converting this energy to radiation deserve further exploration.         |

|**Abstract**|            Discovering transiting exoplanets with relatively long orbital periods ($>$10 days) is crucial to facilitate the study of cool exoplanet atmospheres ($T_{\rm eq} < 700 K$) and to understand exoplanet formation and inward migration further out than typical transiting exoplanets. In order to discover these longer period transiting exoplanets, long-term photometric and radial velocity campaigns are required. We report the discovery of TOI-2447 b ($=$ NGTS-29b), a Saturn-mass transiting exoplanet orbiting a bright (T=10.0) Solar-type star (T$_{\rm eff}$=5730 K). TOI-2447 b was identified as a transiting exoplanet candidate from a single transit event of 1.3% depth and 7.29 h duration in $TESS$ Sector 31 and a prior transit event from 2017 in NGTS data. Four further transit events were observed with NGTS photometry which revealed an orbital period of P=69.34 days. The transit events establish a radius for TOI-2447 b of $0.865 \pm 0.010\rm R_{\rm J}$, while radial velocity measurements give a mass of $0.386 \pm 0.025 \rm M_{\rm J}$. The equilibrium temperature of the planet is $414$ K, making it much cooler than the majority of $TESS$ planet discoveries. We also detect a transit signal in NGTS data not caused by TOI-2447 b, along with transit timing variations and evidence for a $\sim$150 day signal in radial velocity measurements. It is likely that the system hosts additional planets, but further photometry and radial velocity campaigns will be needed to determine their parameters with confidence. TOI-2447 b/NGTS-29b joins a small but growing population of cool giants that will provide crucial insights into giant planet composition and formation mechanisms.         |

|**Abstract**|            We investigate the nature of the short-term anomaly that appears in the lensing light curve of KMT-2023-BLG-1866. The anomaly was only partly covered due to its short duration, less than a day, coupled with cloudy weather conditions and restricted nighttime duration. Considering intricacy of interpreting partially covered signals, we thoroughly explore all potential degenerate solutions. Through this process, we identify three planetary scenarios that equally well account for the observed anomaly. These scenarios are characterized by the specific planetary parameters: $(s, q)_{\rm inner} = [0.9740 \pm 0.0083, (2.46 \pm 1.07) \times 10^{-5}]$, $(s, q)_{\rm intermediate} = [0.9779 \pm 0.0017, (1.56 \pm 0.25)\times 10^{-5}]$, and $(s, q)_{\rm outer} = [0.9894 \pm 0.0107, (2.31 \pm 1.29)\times 10^{-5}]$, where $s$ and $q$ denote the projected separation (scaled to the Einstein radius) and mass ratio between the planet and its host, respectively. We identify that the ambiguity between the inner and outer solutions stems from the inner-outer degeneracy, while the similarity between the intermediate solution and the others is due to an accidental degeneracy caused by incomplete anomaly coverage. Through Bayesian analysis utilizing the constraints derived from measured lensing observables and blending flux, our estimation indicates that the lens system comprises a very low-mass planet orbiting an early M-type star situated approximately (6.2 -- 6.5)~kpc from Earth in terms of median posterior values for the different solutions. The median mass of the planet host is in the range of (0.48 -- 0.51)~$M_\odot$, and that of the planet's mass spans a range of (2.6 -- 4.0)~$M_{\rm E}$, varying across different solutions. The detection of KMT-2023-BLG-1866Lb signifies the extension of the lensing surveys to very low-mass planets that have been difficult to be detected from earlier surveys.         |

|| <mark>J. Liu</mark>, et al. |

|**Abstract**|            Diffuse X-ray Explorer (DIXE) is a proposed X-ray spectroscopic survey experiment for the China Space Station. Its detector assembly (DA) contains the transition edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeter and readout electronics based on the superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) on the cold stage. The cold stage is thermally connected to the ADR stage, and a Kevlar suspension is used to stabilize and isolate it from the 4 K environment. TES and SQUID are both sensitive to the magnetic field, so a hybrid shielding structure consisting of an outer Cryoperm shield and an inner niobium shield is used to attenuate the magnetic field. In addition, IR/optical/UV photons can produce shot noise and thus degrade the energy resolution of the TES microcalorimeter. A blocking filter assembly is designed to minimize the effects. In it, five filters are mounted at different temperature stages, reducing the probability of IR/optical/UV photons reaching the detector through multiple reflections between filters and absorption. This paper will describe the preliminary design of the detector assembly and its optimization.         |

      ) | **Formation of N-bearing complex organic molecules in molecular clouds: Ketenimine, acetonitrile, acetaldimine, and vinylamine via the UV photolysis of C$_2$H$_2$ ice**  |
|| K.-J. Chuang, <mark>C. JÃ¤ger</mark>, J. C. Santos, T. Henning |

|**Abstract**|            The solid-state C$_2$H$_2$ chemistry in interstellar H$_2$O-rich ice has been proposed to explain astronomically observed complex organic molecules (COMs), including ketene (CH$_2$CO), acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO), and ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH), toward early star-forming regions. This formation mechanism is supported by recent laboratory studies and theoretical calculations for the reactions of C$_2$H$_2$+OH/H. However, the analog reaction of C$_2$H$_2$+NH$_2$ forming N-bearing species has been suggested to have a relatively low rate constant that is orders of magnitude lower than the value of C$_2$H$_2$+OH. This work extends our previous laboratory studies on O-bearing COM formation to investigate the interactions between C$_2$H$_2$ and NH$_3$ ice triggered by cosmic ray-induced secondary UV photons under molecular cloud conditions. Experiments were performed in an ultra-high vacuum chamber to investigate the UV photolysis of the C$_2$H$_2$:NH$_3$ ice mixture at 10 K. The studied ice chemistry of C$_2$H$_2$ with NH$_2$ radicals and H atoms resulting from the UV photodissociation of NH$_3$ leads to the formation of several N-bearing COMs, including vinylamine (CH$_2$CHNH$_2$), acetaldimine (CH$_3$CHNH), acetonitrile (CH$_3$CN), ketenimine (CH$_2$CNH), and tentatively ethylamine (CH$_3$CH$_2$NH$_2$). The experimental results show an immediate and abundant CH$_2$CHNH$_2$ yield as the first-generation product, which is further converted into other chemical derivatives. The effective destruction and formation cross-section values of parent species and COMs were derived, and we discuss the chemical links among these molecules and their astronomical relevance.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present early-phase good cadence simultaneous multi-band ($ugi$, $vrz$--bands) imaging of nearby supernova SN 2024ggi, which exploded in the nearby galaxy, NGC~3621. A quick follow-up was conducted within less than a day after the explosion and continued $\sim$23 days. The $uvg$-band light curves display a rapid rise ($\sim$1.4 mag day$^{-1}$) to maximum in $\sim$4 days and absolute magnitude $M_{g}\sim$--17.75 mag. The post-peak decay rate in redder bands is $\sim$0.01 mag day$^{-1}$. Different colors (e.g., $u-g$ and $v-r$) of SN~2024ggi are slightly redder than SN~2023ixf. A significant rise ($\sim$12.5 kK) in black-body temperature (optical) was noticed within $\sim$2 days after the explosion, which successively decreased, indicating shock break out inside a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) surrounding the progenitor. Using semi-analytical modeling, the ejecta mass and progenitor radius were estimated as 1.2 M$_{\odot}$ and $\sim$550 R$_{\odot}$, respectively. The archival deep images ($g,r,i,z$-bands) from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) were examined, and a possible progenitor was detected in each band ($\sim$22--22.5 mag) and had a mass range of 14--17 M$_{\odot}$.         |

|| M. Polletta, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            Dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) contribute significantly to the stellar buildup at cosmic noon. Major mergers and gas accretion are often invoked to explain DSFGs' prodigious star-formation rates (SFRs) and large stellar masses. We conducted a spatially-resolved morphological analysis of the rest-frame UV/NIR emission in three DSFGs at z~2.5. Initially discovered as CO emitters by NOEMA observations of a bright Herschel source, we observed them with the JWST/NIRCam as part of the PEARLS program. The NIRCam data reveal the galaxies' stellar population and dust distribution on scales of 250 pc. Spatial variations in stellar mass, SFR, and dust extinction are determined in resolved maps obtained through pixel-based SED fitting. The CO emitters are massive, dusty starburst galaxies with SFRs ranging from 340 to 2500 Msun/yr, positioning them among the most active SFGs at 2<z<3. Notably, they belong to the ~1.5% of the entire JWST population with extremely red colors. Their morphologies are disk-like, with effective radii of 2.0-4.4 kpc, and exhibit sub-structures such as clumps and spiral arms. The galaxies have dust extinctions up to Av=5-7 mag with asymmetric distributions extending over several kpc and including off-center regions resembling bent spiral arms and clumps. The NIR dust-attenuation curve in these sources deviates from standard laws, implying different dust grain properties than commonly assumed in starburst galaxies. The proximity of galaxies with consistent redshifts, strong color gradients, overall disturbed appearance, asymmetric dust obscuration, and wide-spread star formation favor interactions (minor mergers and flybys) as the mechanism driving the CO galaxies' exceptional SFRs. Their large masses and rich environment hint at membership in two proto-structures, as initially inferred from their association with a Planck-selected high-z source.         |
