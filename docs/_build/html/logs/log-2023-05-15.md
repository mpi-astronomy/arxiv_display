|**Abstract**| Context. Filamentary structures in the interstellar medium are closely related to star formation. Dense gas mass fraction (DGMF) or clump formation efficiency in large-scale filaments possibly determine their hosting star formation activities. Aims. We aim to automatically identify large-scale filaments, characterize them, investigate their association with Galactic structures, and study their DGMFs. Methods. We use a modified minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm to chain parsec-scale 13CO clumps previously extracted from the SEDIGISM (Structure, Excitation, and Dynamics of the Inner Galactic InterStellar Medium) survey. The MST connects nodes in a graph such that the sum of edge lengths is minimum. Modified MST also ensures velocity coherence between nodes, so the identified filaments are coherent in position-position-velocity (PPV) space. Results. We generate a catalog of 88 large-scale ($>10pc$) filaments in the inner Galactic plane (with $-60^\circ < l < 18^\circ and $|b| < 0.5^\circ$). These SEDIGISM filaments are larger and less dense than MST filaments previously identified from the BGPS and ATLASGAL surveys. We find that eight of the filaments run along spiral arms and can be regarded as "bones" of the Milky Way. We also find three bones associated with the Local Spur in PPV space. By compiling 168 large-scale filaments with available DGMF across the Galaxy, an order of magnitude more than previously investigated, we find that DGMFs do not correlate with Galactic location, but bones have higher DGMFs than other filaments. |
