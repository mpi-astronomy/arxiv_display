|**Abstract**| Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are massive star clusters found in all types of galaxies from dwarfs to massive galaxies. Recent studies show that while low-mass NSCs in dwarf galaxies ($M_\text{gal} < 10^{9} M_\odot$) form predominantly out of the merger of globular clusters (GCs), high-mass NSCs in massive galaxies have assembled most of their mass through central enriched star formation. So far, these results of a transition in the dominant NSC formation channel have been based on studies of early-type galaxies and massive late-type galaxies. Here, we present the first spectroscopic analysis of a sample of nine nucleated late-type dwarf galaxies with the aim of identifying the dominant NSC formation pathway. We use integral-field spectroscopy data obtained with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument to analyse the ages, metallicities, star formation histories, and star formation rates of the NSCs and their surroundings. Our sample includes galaxies with stellar masses $M_\text{gal} = 10^7 - 10^9 M_\odot$ and NSC masses $M_\text{NSC} = 6 \times 10^4 - 6 \times 10^{6} M_\odot$. Although all NSC spectra show emission lines, this emission is not always connected to star formation within the NSC, but rather to other regions along the line-of-sight. The NSC star formation histories reveal that metal-poor and old populations dominate the stellar populations in five NSCs, possibly stemming from the inspiral of GCs. The NSCs of the most massive galaxies in our sample show significant contributions from young and enriched populations that indicate additional mass growth through central star formation. Our results support previous findings of a transition in the dominant NSC formation channel with galaxy mass, showing that the NSCs in low-mass galaxies predominantly grow through the inspiral of GCs, while central star formation can contribute to NSC growth in more massive galaxies. |

|**Abstract**| Supernova (SN) 2021ocs was discovered in the galaxy NGC 7828 within the interacting system Arp 144, and subsequently classified as a normal type-Ic SN around peak brightness. VLT/FORS2 observations in the nebular phase at 150 d reveal that the spectrum is dominated by oxygen and magnesium emission lines of different transitions and ionization states: O I, [O I], [O II], [O III], Mg I, and Mg II. Such a spectrum has no counterpart in the literature, though it bears a few features similar to those of some interacting type Ibn and Icn SNe. Additionally, SN 2021ocs showed a blue color, $(g-r) \lesssim -0.5$ mag, after the peak, atypical for a type-Ic SN. Together with the nebular spectrum, this suggests that SN 2021ocs underwent late-time interaction with an H/He-poor circumstellar medium (CSM), resulting from the pre-SN progenitor mass loss during its final $\sim$1000 days. The strong O and Mg lines and the absence of strong C and He lines suggest that the progenitor star's O-Mg layer is exposed, which places SN 2021ocs as the most extreme case of massive progenitor star's envelope stripping in interacting SNe, followed by type-Icn (stripped C-O layer) and Ibn (stripped He-rich layer) SNe. This is the first time such case is reported in the literature. SN 2021ocs emphasizes the importance of late-time spectroscopy of even seemingly normal SNe, which reveals the inner ejecta and progenitor star's mass loss history. |

|**Abstract**| We investigate general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations (GRMHD) to determine the physical origin of the twisty patterns of linear polarization seen in spatially resolved black hole images and explain their morphological dependence on black hole spin. By characterising the observed emission with a simple analytic ring model, we find that the twisty morphology is determined by the magnetic field structure in the emitting region. Moreover, the dependence of this twisty pattern on spin can be attributed to changes in the magnetic field geometry that occur due to the frame dragging. By studying an analytic ring model, we find that the roles of Doppler boosting and lensing are subdominant. Faraday rotation may cause a systematic shift in the linear polarization pattern, but we find that its impact is subdominant for models with strong magnetic fields and modest ion-to-electron temperature ratios. Models with weaker magnetic fields are much more strongly affected by Faraday rotation and have more complicated emission geometries than can be captured by a ring model. However, these models are currently disfavoured by the recent EHT observations of M87*. Our results suggest that linear polarization maps can provide a probe of the underlying magnetic field structure around a black hole, which may then be usable to indirectly infer black hole spins. The generality of these results should be tested with alternative codes, initial conditions, and plasma physics prescriptions. |

|**Abstract**| We have collected a new deep {\it Chandra X-ray Observatory} ({\it CXO}) exposure of PSR B2224+65 and the `Guitar Nebula', mapping the complex X-ray structure. This is accompanied by a new {\it HST} H$\alpha$ image of the head of the Guitar. Comparing the {\it HST} and {\it CXO} structures in 4 epochs over 25 years, we constrain the evolution of the TeV particles that light up the filament. Cross-field diffusion appears to be enhanced, likely by the injected particles, behind the filament's sharp leading edge, explaining the filament width and its evolving surface brightness profile. |

|**Abstract**| With respect to the $\rm H\beta$ full width at half-maximum ($\rm FWHM_{H\beta}$), the broad $\rm H\beta$ line dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$) was preferred as a velocity tracer to calculate the single-epoch supermassive black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) suggested by \cite{Yu2020b}. For a compiled sample of 311 broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) with measured hard X-ray photon index ($z<0.7$), $\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$ and the optical Fe II relative strength ($R_{\rm Fe}$) are measured from their optical spectra, which are used to calculate $\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$-based virial $M_{\rm BH}$ and dimensionless accretion rate ($\dot{\mathscr{M}}$). With respect to $\rm FWHM_{\rm H\beta}$, it is found that the mean value of $\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$-based $M_{\rm BH}$ is on average larger by 0.26 dex, and the mean value of $\sigma_{\rm H\beta}$-based $\dot{\mathscr{M}}$ is on average smaller by 0.51 dex. It is found that there exists a non-linear relationship between the Eddington ratio ($L_{\rm Bol}/L_{\rm Edd}$) and $\dot{\mathscr{M}}$, i.e., $L_{\rm Bol}/L_{\rm Edd} \propto \dot{\mathscr{M}}^{0.56\pm 0.01}$. This non-linear relationship comes from the accretion efficiency $\eta$, which is smaller for AGN with higher $\dot{\mathscr{M}}$. We find a strong bivariate correlation of the fraction of energy released in the corona $F_{\rm X}$ with $\dot{\mathscr{M}}$ and \mbh, $F_{\rm X} \propto \dot{\mathscr{M}}^{-0.57\pm 0.05} M_{\rm BH}^{-0.54\pm 0.06}$. The flat slope of $-0.57\pm 0.05$ favours the shear stress tensor of the accretion disk being proportional to the geometric mean of gas pressure and total pressure. We find a strong bivariate relation of $\Gamma$ with $\dot{\mathscr{M}}$ and $F_{\rm X}$, $\Gamma \propto \dot{\mathscr{M}}^{-0.21\pm 0.02}F_{\rm X}^{0.02\pm 0.04}$. The hard X-ray spectrum becomes softer with increasing of $F_{\rm X}$, although the scatter is large. |

|**Abstract**| We report the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) detection of the $\gamma$-ray emission toward the massive star forming region of Carina Nebula Complex (CNC). Using the latest source catalog and diffuse background models, we found that the GeV $\gamma$-ray emission in this region can be resolved into three different components. The GeV $\gamma$-ray emission from the central point source is considered to originate from the Eta Carina ($\eta$ Car). We further found the diffuse GeV $\gamma$-ray emission around the CNC which can be modelled by two Gaussian disks with radii of 0.4\deg (region A) and 0.75\deg (region B), respectively. The GeV $\gamma$-ray emission from both the regions A and B have good spatial consistency with the derived molecular gas in projection on the sky. The GeV $\gamma$-ray emission of region A reveals a characteristic spectral shape of the pion-decay process, which indicates that the $\gamma$-rays are produced by the interactions of hadronic cosmic rays with ambient gas. The $\gamma$-rays spectrum of region B has a hard photon index of 2.12 $\pm$ 0.02, which is similar to other young massive star clusters. We argue that the diffuse GeV $\gamma$-ray emission in region A and region B likely originate from the interaction of accelerated protons in clusters with the ambient gas. |

|**Abstract**| Optical SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) instruments that can explore the very fast time domain, especially with large sky coverage, offer an opportunity for new discoveries that can complement multimessenger and time domain astrophysics. The Panoramic SETI experiment (PANOSETI) aims to observe optical transients with nanosecond to second duration over a wide field-of-view ($\thicksim$2,500 sq.deg.) by using two assemblies of tens of telescopes to reject spurious signals by coincidence detection. Three PANOSETI telescopes, connected to a White Rabbit timing network used to synchronize clocks at the nanosecond level, have been deployed at Lick Observatory on two sites separated by a distance of 677 meters to distinguish nearby light sources (such as Cherenkov light from particle showers in the Earth's atmosphere) from astrophysical sources at large distances. In parallel to this deployment, we present results obtained during four nights of simultaneous observations with the four 12-meter VERITAS gamma-ray telescopes and two PANOSETI telescopes at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory. We report PANOSETI's first detection of astrophysical gamma rays, comprising three events with energies in the range between $\thicksim$15 TeV and $\thicksim$50 TeV. These were emitted by the Crab Nebula, and identified as gamma rays using joint VERITAS observations. |

|**Abstract**| Titan has a diverse range of materials in its atmosphere and on its surface: the simple organics that reside in various phases (gas, liquid, ice) and the solid complex refractory organics that form Titan's haze layers. These materials all actively participate in various physical processes on Titan, and many material properties are found to be important in shaping these processes. Future in-situ exploration on Titan would likely encounter a range of materials, and a comprehensive database to archive the material properties of all possible material candidates will be needed. Here we summarize several important material properties of the organic liquids, ices, and the refractory hazes on Titan that are available in the literature and/or that we have computed. These properties include thermodynamic properties (phase change points, sublimation and vaporization saturation vapor pressure, and latent heat), physical property (density), and surface properties (liquid surface tensions and solid surface energies). We have developed a new database to provide a repository for these data and make them available to the science community. These data can be used as inputs for various theoretical models to interpret current and future remote sensing and in-situ atmospheric and surface measurements on Titan. The material properties of the simple organics may also be applicable for giant planets and icy bodies in the outer solar system, interstellar medium, and protoplanetary disks. |

|**Abstract**| Although a large number of Galactic open clusters (OCs) have been identified, the internal kinematic properties (e.g., rotation) of almost all the known OCs are still far from clear. With the high-precision astrometric data of Gaia EDR3, we have developed a methodology to unveil the rotational properties of the Praesepe cluster. Statistics of the three-dimensional residual motions of the member stars reveal the presence of Praesepe's rotation and determine its spatial rotation axis. The mean rotation velocity of the Praesepe cluster within its tidal radius is estimated to be 0.2 $\pm$ 0.05 km s$^{-1}$, and the corresponding rotation axis is tilted in relation to the Galactic plane with an angle of 41 $\pm$ 12 degree. We also analysed the rms rotational velocity of the member stars around the rotation axis, and found that the rotation of the member stars within the tidal radius of Praesepe probably follows the Newton's classical theorems. |

|**Abstract**| The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array with the planned electronic upgrades will deliver an unprecedented amount of deep and high resolution observations. Wider fields of view are possible with the consequential cost of image reconstruction. Alternatives to commonly used applications in image processing have to be sought and tested. Advanced image reconstruction methods are critical to meet the data requirements needed for operational purposes. Astrostatistics and astroinformatics techniques are employed. Evidence is given that these interdisciplinary fields of study applied to synthesis imaging meet the Big Data challenges and have the potentials to enable new scientific discoveries in radio astronomy and astrophysics. |

|**Abstract**| We probe how common extremely rapid rotation is among massive stars in the early universe by measuring the OBe star fraction in nearby metal-poor dwarf galaxies. We apply a new method that uses broad-band photometry to measure the galaxy-wide OBe star fractions in the Magellanic Clouds and three more distant, more metal-poor dwarf galaxies. We find OBe star fractions of ~20% in the Large Magellanic Cloud (0.5 Z_Solar), and ~30% in the Small Magellanic Cloud (0.2 Z_Solar) as well as in the so-far unexplored metallicity range from 0.1 Z_solar to 0.2 Z_solar occupied by the other three dwarf galaxies. Our results imply that extremely rapid rotation is common among massive stars in metal-poor environments such as the early universe. |

|| Slawomir Mianowski, et al. -- incl., <mark>Hancheng Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2022-10-05*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**| POLAR-2 is a space-borne polarimeter, built to investigate the polarization of Gamma-Ray Bursts and help elucidate their mechanisms. The instrument is targeted for launch in 2024 or 2025 aboard the China Space Station and is being developed by a collaboration between institutes from Switzerland, Germany, Poland and China. The instrument will orbit at altitudes between 340km and 450km with an inclination of 42$^{\circ}$ and will be subjected to background radiation from cosmic rays and solar events. It is therefore pertinent to better understand the performance of sensitive devices under space-like conditions. In this paper we focus on the radiation damage of the silicon photomultiplier arrays S13361-6075NE-04 and S14161-6050HS-04 from Hamamatsu. The S13361 are irradiated with 58MeV protons at several doses up to 4.96Gy, whereas the newer series S14161 are irradiated at doses of 0.254Gy and 2.31Gy. Their respective performance degradation due to radiation damage are discussed. The equivalent exposure time in space for silicon photomultipliers inside POLAR-2 with a dose of 4.96Gy is 62.9 years (or 1.78 years when disregarding the shielding from the instrument). Primary characteristics of the I-V curves are an increase in the dark current and dark counts, mostly through cross-talk events. Annealing processes at $25^{\circ}C$ were observed but not studied in further detail. Biasing channels while being irradiated have not resulted in any significant impact. Activation analyses showed a dominant contribution of $\beta^{+}$ particles around 511keV. These resulted primarily from copper and carbon, mostly with decay times shorter than the orbital period. |

|**Abstract**| The post-common envelope binary V471 Tauri has been an object of interest for decades. V471 Tau shows various phenomena due to its evolutionary state and unique properties, e.g. its magnetic accretion and eclipse timing variation (ETV). Previous authors explained the ETVs by different, sometimes contradictory theories. In this paper, we present and analyse the variability of the eclipse timing of this star. We observed V471 Tauri over the last ten years and covered the second cycle of its period variation. Based on our analysis of the presented data, we assess the possible existence of a brown dwarf in this system and derive its orbital parameters. We compare the results of our dynamical modelling to the solution predicted by Applegate-mechanism theories, which have been developed in recent studies. We found that the observed ETV cannot be explained only by the presence of additional components to the binary. |

|**Abstract**| Understanding the radiative-dynamical coupling between upper photosphere and deeper atmosphere is a key in understanding the abnormal large radii of hot Jupiters. One needs very long integration times of 3D general circulation models (GCMs) with self consistent radiative transfer to achieve a better understanding of the feedback process between dynamics and radiation. We here present the longest 3D non-gray GCM study (86000 d) of an ultra hot Jupiter (WASP-76 b) published to this date that reached a final converged state. Furthermore, we present a method that can be used to accelerate the path towards temperature convergence in the deep atmospheric layers. We find that the final converged temperature profile is cold in the deep atmospheric layers, lacking any sign of vertical transport of potential temperature by large scale atmospheric motions. We thus conclude that the coupling between radiation and dynamics alone is not sufficient to explain the abnormal large radii of inflated hot gas giants. |

|**Abstract**| The latest Gaia Data Release 3 provides an opportunity to expand the census of Galactic open clusters harboring classical Cepheid variables, thereby bolstering the cosmic distance scale. A comprehensive analysis yielded a total of 50 classical Cepheids associated with 45 open clusters, of which 39 open cluster-classical Cepheid pairs are considered probable, with the remaining 11 pairs considered improbable but worth following up. Two previously identified clusters by us possibly host classical Cepheids (OC-0125/V1788 Cyg and OC-0675/OGLE-BLG-CEP-114). In addition, we identify 38 new open cluster candidates within the Galactic disk. |

|**Abstract**| We present the first survey of quiet Sun features observed in hard X-rays (HXRs), using the the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray (NuSTAR), a HXR focusing optics telescope. The recent solar minimum combined with NuSTAR's high sensitivity has presented a unique opportunity to perform the first HXR imaging spectroscopy on a range of features in the quiet Sun. By studying the HXR emission of these features we can detect or constrain the presence of high temperature (>5 MK) or non-thermal sources, to help understand how they relate to larger more energetic solar phenomena, and determine their contribution to heating the solar atmosphere. We report on several features observed in the 28 September 2018 NuSTAR full-disk quiet Sun mosaics, the first of the NuSTAR quiet Sun observing campaigns, which mostly include steady features of X-ray bright points and an emerging flux region which later evolved into an active region, as well as a short-lived jet. We find that the features' HXR spectra are well fitted with isothermal models with temperatures ranging between 2.0-3.2 MK. Combining the NuSTAR data with softer X-ray emission from Hinode/XRT and EUV from SDO/AIA we recover the differential emission measures, confirming little significant emission above 4 MK. The NuSTAR HXR spectra allow us to constrain the possible non-thermal emission that would still be consistent with a null HXR detection. We found that for only one of the features (the jet) was there a potential non-thermal upper limit capable of powering the heating observed. However, even here the non-thermal electron distribution had to be very steep (effectively mono-energetic) with a low energy cut-off between 3-4 keV. The higher temperature or non-thermal sources in the typical quiet Sun features found in this September 2018 data are therefore found to be very weak, if present at all. |

|**Abstract**| We present observations of ammonia emission lines toward the interstellar filament WB~673 hosting the dense clumps WB~673, WB~668, S233-IR and G173.57+2.43. LTE analysis of the lines allows us to estimate gas kinetic temperature ($\lesssim$ 30~K in all the clumps), number density ($7-17\times10^3$~cm$^{-3}$), and ammonia column density ($\approx 1-1.5\times 10^{15}$~cm$^{-2}$) in the dense clumps. We find signatures of collapse in WB 673 and presence of compact spatially unresolved dense clumps in S233-IR. We reconstruct 1D density and temperature distributions in the clumps and estimate their ages using astrochemical modelling. Considering CO, CS, NH$_3$ and N$_2$H$^+$ molecules (plus HCN and HNC for WB~673), we find a chemical age of $t_{\rm chem}=1-3\times 10^5$~yrs providing the best agreement between the simulated and observed column densities in all the clumps. Therefore, we consider $t_{\rm chem}$ as the chemical age of the entire filament. A long preceding low-density stage of gas accumulation in the astrochemical model would break the agreement between the simulated and observed column densities. We suggest that rapid star formation over a $\sim 10^5$~yrs timescale take place in the filament. |

|**Abstract**| Optical astronomical images are strongly affected by the point spread function (PSF) of the optical system and the atmosphere (seeing) which blurs the observed image. The amount of blurring depends both on the observed band, and more crucially, on the atmospheric conditions during observation. A typical astronomical image will therefore have a unique PSF that is non-circular and different in different bands. Observations of known stars give us a determination of this PSF. Therefore, any serious candidate for production analysis of astronomical images must take the known PSF into account during the image analysis. So far the majority of applications of neural networks (NN) to astronomical image analysis have ignored this problem by assuming a fixed PSF in training and validation. We present a neural network based deconvolution algorithm based on Deep Wiener Deconvolution Network (DWDN) that takes the PSF shape into account when performing deconvolution as an example of one possible approach to enabling neural network to use the PSF information. We study the performance of several versions of this algorithm under realistic observational conditions in terms of recovery of most relevant astronomical quantities such as colors, ellipticities and orientations. We also investigate the performance of custom loss functions and find that they cause modest improvements in the recovery of astronomical quantities. |

|**Abstract**| We present a spectroscopic survey of 248 white dwarf candidates within 40 pc of the Sun; of these 244 are in the southern hemisphere. Observations were performed mostly with the Very Large Telescope (X-Shooter) and Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope. Almost all candidates were selected from $\textit{Gaia}$ Data Release 3 (DR3). We find a total of 246 confirmed white dwarfs, 209 of which had no previously published spectra, and two main-sequence star contaminants. Of these, 100 white dwarfs display hydrogen Balmer lines, 69 have featureless spectra, and two show only neutral helium lines. Additionally, 14 white dwarfs display traces of carbon, while 37 have traces of other elements that are heavier than helium. We observe 36 magnetic white dwarfs through the detection of Zeeman splitting of their hydrogen Balmer or metal spectral lines. High spectroscopic completeness (> 97 per cent) has now been reached, such that we have 1058 confirmed $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3 white dwarfs out of 1083 candidates within 40 pc of the Sun at all declinations. |

|**Abstract**| The purpose of this white paper is to put together a coherent vision for the role of helioseismic monitoring of magnetic activity in the Sun's far hemisphere that will contribute to improving space weather forecasting as well as fundamental research in the coming decade. Our goal fits into the broader context of helioseismology in solar research for any number of endeavors when helioseismic monitors may be the sole synoptic view of the Sun's far hemisphere. It is intended to foster a growing understanding of solar activity, as realistically monitored in both hemispheres, and its relationship to all known aspects of the near-Earth and terrestrial environment. Some of the questions and goals that can be fruitfully pursued through seismic monitoring of farside solar activity in the coming decade include: What is the relationship between helioseismic signatures and their associated magnetic configurations, and how is this relationship connected to the solar EUV irradiance over the period of a solar rotation?; How can helioseismic monitoring contribute to data-driven global magnetic-field models for precise space weather forecasting?; What can helioseismic monitors tell us about prospects of a flare, CME or high-speed stream that impacts the terrestrial environment over the period of a solar rotation?; How does the inclusion of farside information contribute to forecasts of interplanetary space weather and the environments to be encountered by human crews in interplanetary space? Thus, it is crucial for the development of farside monitoring of the Sun be continued into the next decade either through ground-based or space-borne observations. |
