|**Abstract**| We observed the high-mass star-forming core G336.01-0.82 at 1.3 mm and 0.05'' (~150 au) angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) as part of the Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA) survey. These high-resolution observations reveal two spiral streamers feeding a circumstellar disk at opposite sides in great detail. Molecular line emission from CH$_3$OH shows velocity gradients along the streamers consistent with infall. Similarly, a flattened envelope model with rotation and infall implies a mass larger than 10 M$_\odot$ for the central source and a centrifugal barrier of 300 au. The location of the centrifugal barrier is consistent with local peaks in the continuum emission. We argue that gas brought by the spiral streamers is accumulating at the centrifugal barrier, which can result in future accretion burst events. A total high infall rate of ~$4\times10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is derived by matching models to the observed velocity gradient along the streamers. Their contribution account for 20-50% the global infall rate of the core, indicating streamers play an important role in the formation of high-mass stars. |

|**Abstract**| Intracluster Light (ICL) provides an important record of the interactions galaxy clusters have undergone. However, we are limited in our understanding by our measurement methods. To address this we measure the fraction of cluster light that is held in the Brightest Cluster Galaxy and ICL (BCG+ICL fraction) and the ICL alone (ICL fraction) using observational methods (Surface Brightness Threshold-SB, Non-Parametric Measure-NP, Composite Models-CM, Multi-Galaxy Fitting-MGF) and new approaches under development (Wavelet Decomposition-WD) applied to mock images of 61 galaxy clusters (14<log10 M_200c/M_solar <14.5) from four cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We compare the BCG+ICL and ICL fractions from observational measures with those using simulated measures (aperture and kinematic separations). The ICL fractions measured by kinematic separation are significantly larger than observed fractions. We find the measurements are related and provide equations to estimate kinematic ICL fractions from observed fractions. The different observational techniques give consistent BCG+ICL and ICL fractions but are biased to underestimating the BCG+ICL and ICL fractions when compared with aperture simulation measures. Comparing the different methods and algorithms we find that the MGF algorithm is most consistent with the simulations, and CM and SB methods show the smallest projection effects for the BCG+ICL and ICL fractions respectively. The Ahad (CM), MGF and WD algorithms are best set up to process larger samples, however, the WD algorithm in its current form is susceptible to projection effects. We recommend that new algorithms using these methods are explored to analyse the massive samples that Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time will provide. |

|**Abstract**| High-resolution JWST-MIRI images of nearby spiral galaxies reveal emission with complex substructures that trace dust heated both by massive young stars and the diffuse interstellar radiation field. We present high angular (0."85) and physical resolution (20-80 pc) measurements of the probability distribution function (PDF) of mid-infrared (mid-IR) emission (7.7-21 $\mu$m) from 19 nearby star-forming galaxies from the PHANGS-JWST Cycle-1 Treasury. The PDFs of mid-IR emission from the disks of all 19 galaxies consistently show two distinct components: an approximately log-normal distribution at lower intensities and a high-intensity power-law component. These two components only emerge once individual star-forming regions are resolved. Comparing with locations of HII regions identified from VLT/MUSE H$\alpha$-mapping, we infer that the power-law component arises from star-forming regions and thus primarily traces dust heated by young stars. In the continuum-dominated 21 $\mu$m band, the power-law is more prominent and contains roughly half of the total flux. At 7.7-11.3 $\mu$m, the power-law is suppressed by the destruction of small grains (including PAHs) close to HII regions while the log-normal component tracing the dust column in diffuse regions appears more prominent. The width and shape of the log-normal diffuse emission PDFs in galactic disks remain consistent across our sample, implying a log-normal gas column density $N$(H)$\approx10^{21}$cm$^{-2}$ shaped by supersonic turbulence with typical (isothermal) turbulent Mach numbers $\approx5-15$. Finally, we describe how the PDFs of galactic disks are assembled from dusty HII regions and diffuse gas, and discuss how the measured PDF parameters correlate with global properties such as star-formation rate and gas surface density. |

|**Abstract**| We introduce a number of new theoretical approaches and improvements to the thermo-chemical disc modelling code ProDiMo to better predict and analyse the JWST line spectra of protoplanetary discs. We develop a new line escape probability method for disc geometries, a new scheme for dust settling, and discuss how to apply UV molecular shielding factors to photorates in 2D disc geometry. We show that these assumptions are crucial for the determination of the gas heating/cooling rates and discuss how they affect the predicted molecular concentrations and line emissions. We apply our revised 2D models to the protoplanetary disc around the T Tauri star EX Lupi in quiescent state. We calculate infrared line emission spectra between 5 and 20 mic by CO, H2O, OH, CO2, HCN, C2H2 and H2, including lines of atoms and ions, using our full 2D predictions of molecular abundances, dust opacities, gas and dust temperatures. We develop a disc model with a slowly increasing surface density structure around the inner rim that can simultaneously fit the spectral energy distribution, the overall shape of the JWST spectrum of EX Lupi, and the main observed molecular characteristics in terms of column densities, emitting areas and molecular emission temperatures, which all result from one consistent disc model. The spatial structure of the line emitting regions of the different molecules is discussed. High abundances of HCN and C2H2 are caused in the model by stellar X-ray irradiation of the gas around the inner rim. |
