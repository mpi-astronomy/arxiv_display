|**Abstract**|            A phase shift in the acoustic oscillations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectra is a characteristic signature for the presence of non-photon radiation propagating differently from photons, even when the radiation couples to the Standard Model particles solely gravitationally. It is well-established that compared to the presence of free-streaming radiation, CMB spectra shift to higher $\ell$-modes in the presence of self-interacting non-photon radiation such as neutrinos and dark radiation. In this study, we further demonstrate that the scattering of non-photon radiation with dark matter can further amplify this phase shift. We show that when the energy density of the interacting radiation surpasses that of interacting dark matter around matter-radiation equality, the phase shift enhancement is proportional to the interacting dark matter abundance and remains insensitive to the radiation energy density. Given the presence of dark matter-radiation interaction, this additional phase shift emerges as a generic signature of models featuring an interacting dark sector or neutrino-dark matter scattering. Using neutrino-dark matter scattering as an example, we numerically calculate the amplified phase shift and offer an analytical interpretation of the result by modeling photon and neutrino perturbations with coupled harmonic oscillators. This framework also explains the phase shift contrast between self-interacting and free-streaming neutrinos. Fitting models with neutrino-dark matter or dark radiation-dark matter interactions to CMB and large-scale structure data, we validate the presence of the enhanced phase shift, affirmed by the linear dependence observed between the preferred regions of the sound horizon angle $\theta_s$ and interacting dark matter abundance.         |

|**Abstract**|            Discovery of pulsations from a number of ultra-luminous X-ray (ULX) sources proved that accretion onto neutron stars can produce luminosities exceeding the Eddington limit by a couple of orders of magnitude. The conditions necessary to achieve such high luminosities as well as the exact geometry of the accretion flow in the neutron star vicinity are, however, a matter of debate. The pulse phase-resolved polarization measurements that became possible with the launch of the IXPE can be used to determine the pulsar geometry and its orientation relative to the orbital plane. They provide an avenue to test different theoretical models of ULX pulsars. In this paper we present the results of three IXPE observations of the first Galactic ULX pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 during its 2023 outburst. We find strong variations of the polarization characteristics with the pulsar phase. The average polarization degree increases from about 5% to 15% as the flux dropped by a factor of three in the course of the outburst. The polarization angle (PA) as function of the pulsar phase shows two peaks in the first two observations, but changes to a characteristic sawtooth pattern in the remaining data set. This is not consistent with a simple rotating vector model. Assuming the existence of an additional constant polarized component, we were able to fit the three observations with a common rotating vector model and obtain constraints on the pulsar geometry. In particular, we find the pulsar angular momentum inclination with respect to the line-of-sight of 15-40 deg, the magnetic obliquity of 60-80 deg, and the pulsar spin position angle of -50 deg, which differs from the constant component PA of about 10 deg. Combining these X-ray measurements with the optical PA, we find evidence for a 30 deg misalignment between the pulsar spin and the binary orbital axis.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present six nearly full-sky maps made from data taken by radiometers on the Juno satellite during its 5-year flight to Jupiter. The maps represent integrated emission over $\sim 4\%$ passbands spaced approximately in octaves between 600 MHz and 21.9 GHz. Long time-scale offset drifts are removed in all bands, and, for the two lowest frequency bands, gain drifts are also removed from the maps via a self-calibration algorithm similar to the NPIPE pipeline used by the Planck collaboration. We show that, after this solution is applied, residual noise in the maps is consistent with thermal radiometer noise. We verify our map solutions with several consistency tests and end-to-end simulations. We also estimate the level of pixelization noise and polarization leakage via simulations.         |
