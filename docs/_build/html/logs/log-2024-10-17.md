|**Abstract**|            Ethanolamine (NH$_2$CH$_2$CH$_2$OH, EA) has been identified in the gas phase of the ISM within molecular clouds. Although EA has not been directly observed in the molecular ice phase, a solid state formation mechanism has been proposed. However, the current literature lacks an estimation of the infrared band strengths of EA ices. We conducted an experimental investigation of solid EA ice at low temperatures to ascertain its infrared band strengths, phase transition temperature, and multilayer binding energy. The commonly used laser interferometry method was not applied. Infrared band strengths were determined using three distinct methods. The obtained lab spectrum of EA was compared with the publicly available MIRI MRS James Webb Space Telescope observations toward a low mass protostar. The phase transition temperature for EA ice falls within the range of 175 to 185 K. Among the discussed methods, the simple pressure gauge method provides a reasonable estimate of band strength. We derive a band strength value of about $1\times10^{-17}$ cm molecule$^{-1}$ for the NH$_2$ bending mode in the EA molecules. Additionally, temperature-programmed desorption analysis yielded a multilayer desorption energy of 0.61$\pm$0.01 eV. By comparing the laboratory data documented in this study with the JWST spectrum of the low mass protostar IRAS 2A, an upper-limit for the EA ice abundances was derived.         |

|**Abstract**|            We investigated two consecutive solar eruption events in the solar active region (AR) 12994 at the solar eastern limb on 2022 April 15. We found that the flare loops formed by the first eruption were involved in the second eruption. During the initial stage of the second flare, the middle part of these flare loops (E-loops) erupted outward along with the flux ropes below, while the parts of the flare loops (I-loops1 and I-loops2) on either side of the E-loops first rose and then contracted. Approximately 1 hour after the eruption, the heights of I-loops1 and I-loops2 decreased by 9 Mm and 45 Mm, respectively, compared to before the eruption. Their maximum descent velocities were 30 km/s and 130 km/s, respectively. The differential emission measure (DEM) results indicate that the plasma above I-loops1 and I-loops2 began to be heated about 23 minutes and 44 minutes after the start of the second flare, respectively. Within 20 minutes, the plasma temperature in these regions increased from ~3 MK to 6 MK. We proposed an adiabatic heating mechanism that magnetic energy would be converted into thermal and kinetic energy when the pre-stretched loops contract. Our calculations show that the magnetic energy required to heat the two high-temperature regions are 10^29-10^30 erg, which correspond to a loss of field strength of 2-3 G.         |

|**Abstract**|            Owing to their similarities with giant exoplanets, brown dwarf companions of stars provide insights into the fundamental processes of planet formation and evolution. From their orbits, several brown dwarf companions are found to be more massive than theoretical predictions given their luminosities and the ages of their host stars (e.g. Brandt et al. 2021, Cheetham et al. 2018, Li et al. 2023). Either the theory is incomplete or these objects are not single entities. For example, they could be two brown dwarfs each with a lower mass and intrinsic luminosity (Brandt et al. 2021, Howe et al. 2024). The most problematic example is Gliese 229 B (Nakajima et al. 1995, Oppenheimer et al. 1995), which is at least 2-6 times less luminous than model predictions given its dynamical mass of $71.4\pm0.6$ Jupiter masses ($M_{\rm Jup}$) (Brandt et al. 2021). We observed Gliese 229 B with the GRAVITY interferometer and, separately, the CRIRES+ spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. Both sets of observations independently resolve Gliese 229 B into two components, Gliese 229 Ba and Bb, settling the conflict between theory and observations. The two objects have a flux ratio of $0.47\pm0.03$ at a wavelength of 2 $\mu$m and masses of $38.1\pm1.0$ and $34.4\pm1.5$ $M_{\rm Jup}$, respectively. They orbit each other every 12.1 days with a semimajor axis of 0.042 astronomical units (AU). The discovery of Gliese 229 BaBb, each only a few times more massive than the most massive planets, and separated by 16 times the Earth-moon distance, raises new questions about the formation and prevalence of tight binary brown dwarfs around stars.         |
