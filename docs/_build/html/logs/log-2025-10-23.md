|**Abstract**|            We report the discovery and characterization of three transiting giant planets in the TIC118798035 system. The three planets were identified as transiting candidates from data of the TESS mission, and confirmed with ground-based photometric transit observations along with radial velocity variations obtained with FEROS, HARPS and ESPRESSO. The three planets present transit timing variations (TTVs). We performed a N-body orbital fitting to the TTVs and radial velocities finding that TIC118798035 b is as warm low-density Neptune with a mass of 0.0250$\pm$0.0023 $M_J$, a radius of 0.655$\pm$0.018 $R_J$, and an orbital period of 11.507 d; TIC118798035 c is a warm Saturn with a mass of 0.403$\pm$0.024 $M_J$, a radius of 0.973$\pm$0.023 $R_J$, and an orbital period of 22.564 d; and TIC118798035 d is a warm Jupiter with a mass of 0.773$\pm$0.052 $M_J$, a radius of 0.923$\pm$0.044 $R_J$, and an orbital period of 48.925 d. The bulk metallicities of the three planets don't fully follow the mass-metallicity correlation found for the giant planets of the solar system, which hints at a somewhat different formation history for the planets of the TIC118798035 system. TIC118798035 is the only system having more than two transiting planets larger than 0.5 $R_J$ with a precise orbital and physical characterization, amenable for future atmospheric studies.         |

|**Abstract**|            The orbital architectures of compact exoplanet systems record their complicated dynamical histories. Recent research supports the ``breaking-the-chains'' hypothesis, which proposes that compact systems typically form in chains of mean-motion resonances (MMRs) but subsequently break out on a $\sim 100$Myr timescale. We investigate a scenario for breaking the chains through intermittent flybys of planetesimals originating from a distant reservoir. Using $N$-body simulations and semi-analytical calculations, we characterize the disruption of MMRs through these flybys. We find a planetesimal reservoir of total mass $\gtrsim 0.04 M_{\oplus}$ is required to disrupt MMR chains, depending on the mass distribution and the typical number of flybys executed by each planetesimal. We verify that systems disrupted in this way are frequently unstable to close encounters within $\sim 100$Myr of the final flyby. This mechanism operates in systems with both a sufficiently massive reservoir and an efficient mechanism for planetesimal injection. Consequently, we predict an anti-correlation between resonant inner systems and dynamically active outer configurations.         |

|| L. Blomberg, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. El-Badry</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-23*|
|*Comments*| *29 pages, 19 figures, submitted to PASP*|
|**Abstract**|            Stripped stars are hot, helium-rich stars formed when binary interactions remove a star's hydrogen envelope. While low-mass ($\lesssim 1\,M_\odot$) and high-mass ($\gtrsim 8\,M_\odot$) stripped stars are well studied as hot subdwarfs and Wolf-Rayet stars, their intermediate-mass counterparts ($1-8 \,M_\odot$) have only recently been discovered. The Stripped-Star Ultraviolet Magellanic Cloud Survey (SUMS) identified UV-excess sources in the Magellanic Clouds using Swift-UVOT photometry and selected 820 photometric stripped-star candidates. However, the selection function, completeness, and purity of this sample remain poorly understood. We forward model the population of stripped stars in the Magellanic Clouds using a binary population synthesis model combined with spatially resolved star formation histories and simulated UV photometry. To assess survey sensitivity, we inject simulated sources into real Swift-UVOT images and reproduce the SUMS selection process, including crowding, extinction, and photometric quality cuts. We recover $\sim 250$ simulated stripped stars with masses $\gtrsim 1\,M_{\odot}$, which corresponds to a recover rate of $9-13\,\%$. The rest are missed due to dilution by luminous companions, crowding, and high extinction. The observed population is biased toward systems with low-mass companions formed by common envelope evolution and toward systems with compact object companions. Of the stripped stars which show UV excess, $25-45\,\%$ are identifiable by SUMS; higher-resolution data or improved reddening corrections are needed to detect the rest. We predict contamination of the observed stripped star candidates by main-sequence stars with spurious UV excess due to crowding and provide guidelines for selecting higher-purity subsamples. These results enable tests of binary evolution models and realistic comparison of observed and simulated stripped-star populations.         |

|| C. B. Adams, et al. -- incl., <mark>S. Kumar</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-23*|
|*Comments*| *18 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in the Physical Review D (PRD)*|
|**Abstract**|            Background: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical particles that emerge in numerous theoretical extensions to the Standard Model. Their coupling to electromagnetic field implies that ALPs would mix with photons in the presence of external magnetic fields. As ALP phenomenology is governed by the mass and strength of its coupling, there is a subset of this parameter space in which this mixing would be expected to leave an imprint on the spectra of TeV gamma-ray sources. Data: In 2017, the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory recorded the second day of a dramatic flare of the radio galaxy NGC 1275, embedded at the center of the Perseus galaxy cluster. This serendipitous locale provides a spatially-extended magnetic field of strength O(10$\mu$G) through which escaping photons traverse, making it an excellent target to study ALPs. Methods: We analyze the VERITAS data of NGC 1275's 2017 flare with the gammapy analysis package. Extensive fitting and modeling are performed to ultimately conduct a likelihood analysis used to search for any evidence of a preference for ALPs and to explore the confidence with which constraints can be set. We adopt the CLs method for this study for its conservative approach to setting limits in regimes where the search has limited sensitivity. Results: No evidence for the existence of ALPs is found, and no combination of mass and coupling strength can be excluded at or above 95% confidence level. We provide a map showing the strength of our exclusions in the mass and coupling parameter space. The strongest exclusions are found in the mass range $2 \times 10^{-7}$eV $\lesssim m_a \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-7}$eV and at the coupling strength of $g_{a\gamma} \gtrsim 3 \times 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ up to 80% confidence level, which are consistent with previous studies. Conclusions: We find the CLs method to be a trustworthy approach, and advocate for its...         |

|| <mark>Y. Wang</mark>, B. F. Liu, M. Liu |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-23*|
|*Comments*| *10 pages, 6 figures; accepted for publication in MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**|            Accretion in black hole X-ray binaries is commonly believed to be supplied by the Roche lobe overflow or the stellar wind. The former is thought to form a geometrically thin disc while the diffuse wind could form a geometrically thick hot accretion flow. In this paper, we instead consider a more generalised case, i.e., accretion with both cold and hot gas supplies, which feed a disc and a corona respectively. We investigate the interaction of disc and corona by analysing the energy coupling and matter exchange, i.e. corona condensation/disc evaporation, with a semi-analytical method. It is found that the accretion geometry in the radial direction and the resultant emission spectrum depend strongly on both the total gas supply rate and the ratio of cold and hot gases. For gas supply rates of a few percent of the Eddington value, diverse geometries and spectral shapes are possible, depending on the fraction of cold gas supply. This provides an interpretation for the various spectra observed in intermediate states. However, at higher accretion rates, regardless of the form of the feeding gas, the inner accretion flow is always disc-dominated, implying an inevitable transition to the soft state, while at very low gas supply rates, hard state spectrum dominated by the hot flow is expected. We also present the predicted hardness-intensity correlation of Cygnus X-1, and constrain the value of the viscosity parameter of the accretion flow to the range of 0.25--0.35 by comparing our results with MAXI observations.         |
