|**Abstract**| The redshift evolution of bars is an important signpost of the dynamic maturity of disk galaxies. To characterize the intrinsic evolution safe from band-shifting effects, it is necessary to gauge how bar properties vary locally as a function of wavelength. We investigate bar properties in 16 nearby galaxies from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G) at ultraviolet, optical and mid-infrared wavebands. Based on the ellipticity and position angle profiles from fitting elliptical isophotes to the two-dimensional light distribution, we find that both bar length and ellipticity - the latter often used as a proxy for bar strength - increase at bluer wavebands. Bars are 9% longer in the B-band than at 3.6 um. Their ellipticity increases typically by 8% in the B-band, with a significant fraction (>40%) displaying an increase up to 35%. We attribute the increase in bar length to the presence of star forming knots at the end of bars: these regions are brighter in bluer bands, stretching the bar signature further out. The increase in bar ellipticity could be driven by the apparent bulge size: the bulge is less prominent at bluer bands, allowing for thinner ellipses within the bar region. Alternatively, it could be due to younger stellar populations associated to the bar. The resulting effect is that bars appear longer and thinner at bluer wavebands. This indicates that band-shifting effects are significant and need to be corrected for high-redshift studies to reliably gauge any intrinsic evolution of the bar properties with redshift. |

|**Abstract**| Massive infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are considered to host the earliest stages of high-mass star formation. In particular, 70 $\mu$m dark IRDCs are the colder and more quiescent clouds. At a scale of about 5000 au using formaldehyde (H2CO) emission, we investigate the kinetic temperature of dense cores in 12 IRDCs obtained from the pilot ALMA Survey of 70 $\mu$m dark High-mass clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). Compared to 1.3 mm dust continuum and other molecular lines, such as C18O and deuterated species, we find that H2CO is mainly sensitive to low-velocity outflow components rather than to quiescent gas expected in the early phases of star formation. The kinetic temperatures of these components range from 26 to 300 K. The Mach number reaches about 15 with an average value of about 4, suggesting that the velocity distribution of gas traced by H2CO is significantly influenced by a supersonic non-thermal component. In addition, we detect warm line emission from HC3N and OCS in 14 protostellar cores, which requires high excitation temperatures (Eu/k ~ 100 K). These results show that some of the embedded cores in the ASHES fields are in an advanced evolutionary stage, previously unexpected for 70 $\mu$m dark IRDCs. |
