|**Abstract**| The distribution of stars in the Milky Way disc shows a spiral structure--the Snail--in the space of velocity and position normal to the Galactic mid-plane. The Snail appears as straight lines in the vertical frequency--vertical phase plane when effects from sample selection are removed. Their slope has the dimension of inverse time, with the simplest interpretation being the inverse age of the Snail. Here, we devise and fit a simple model in which the spiral starts as a lopsided perturbation from steady state, that winds up into the present-day morphology. The winding occurs because the vertical frequency decreases with vertical action. We use data from stars in Gaia EDR3 that have measured radial velocities, pruned by simple distance and photometric selection functions. We divide the data into boxels of dynamical invariants (radial action, angular momentum); our model fits the data well in many of the boxels. The model parameters have physical interpretations: one, $A$, is a perturbation amplitude, and one, $t$, is interpretable in the simplest models as the time since the event that caused the Snail. We find trends relating the strength and age to angular momentum: (i) the amplitude $A$ is small at low angular momentum ($<1\,600\mathrm{\,kpc\,km\,s}^{-1}$ or guiding-centre radius $< 7.3\,$kpc), and over a factor of three larger, with strong variations, in the outer disc; (ii) there is no single well-defined perturbation time, with $t$ varying between 0.2 and 0.6 Gyr. Residuals between the data and the model display systematic trends, implying that the data call for more complex models. |

|**Abstract**| A primary new capability of JWST is the ability to penetrate the dust in star forming galaxies to identify and study the properties of young star clusters that remain embedded in dust and gas. In this paper we combine new infrared images taken with JWST with our optical HST images of the star-bursting barred (Seyfert2) spiral galaxy NGC 1365. We find that this galaxy has the richest population of massive young clusters of any known galaxy within 30 Mpc, with $\sim$ 30 star clusters that are more massive than 10$^6$ Msolar and younger than 10 Myr. Sixteen of these clusters are newly discovered from our JWST observations. An examination of the optical images reveals that 4 of 30 ($\sim$13$\%$) are so deeply embedded that they cannot be seen in the I band (AV $\gt$ 10 mag), and that 11 of 30 ($\sim$37$\%$) are missing in the HST B band, so age and mass estimates from optical measurements alone are challenging. These numbers suggest that massive clusters in NGC 1365 remain obscured in the visible for $\sim$ 1.3 $\pm$ 0.7 Myr, and are either completely or partially obscured for $\sim$ 3.7 $\pm$ 1.1 Myr. We also use the JWST observations to gain new insights into the triggering of star cluster formation by the collision of gas and dust streamers with gas and dust in the bar. The JWST images reveal previously unknown structures (e.g., bridges and overshoot regions from stars that form in the bar) that help us better understand the orbital dynamics of barred galaxies and associated star-forming rings. Finally, we note that the excellent spatial resolution of the NIRCAM F200W filter provides a better way to separate barely resolved compact clusters from individual stars based on their sizes. |

|**Abstract**| We analysed the phase spiral with data from Gaia DR3. We used an edge detection algorithm to find the border of the phase spiral, allowing us to robustly quantify its shape at different positions. We calculated the time of onset of the phase-mixing by determining the different turns of the phase spiral and using the vertical frequencies from standard potential models of the MW. We find that the phase spiral extends down to -1.2 kpc in height below the plane (about 3 to 5 scale heights of the thin disc) and beyond $\pm 50$ km/s in $V_Z$. We see a secondary branch mostly at positive vertical velocities in the local phase spiral when coloured by azimuthal velocity, and also at different angular momentum in the counts projection. We also find complex variations of the phase spirals with angular momentum and azimuth. All these possibly provide evidence of multiple perturbations (from different times or from different perturbers) and/or that the disc is affected by complex phase mixing processes. We detect the phase spiral from 6 to 11 kpc and find signatures of vertical asymmetries 1-2 kpc beyond this range. We measure small but clear variations with azimuth. When we determine the phase mixing times from the phase spiral at different angular momenta and using the different spiral turns (at different $Z$) we obtain inconsistent times with systematic differences (times increasing with $|L_Z|$ and with $|Z|$). Our determinations are mostly in the range of [0.3-0.9] Gyr, with an average of 0.5 Gyr. The inconsistencies do not change when using different potential models for the MW, different stellar distances and frequencies for different kinetic temperatures. They could stem from the inconsistency of potential models with the true MW, and from too simple modelling, in particular neglecting self-gravity, not considering the multiple perturbations and the interference with other processes. |

|**Abstract**| The Gaia snail is a spiral feature in the distribution of solar-neighbourhood stars in position and velocity normal to the Galactic midplane. The snail probably arises from phase mixing of gravitational disturbances that perturbed the disc in the distant past. The most common hypothesis is that the strongest disturbance resulted from a passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy close to the solar neighbourhood. In this paper we investigate the alternative hypothesis that the snail is created by many small disturbances rather than one large one, that is, by Gaussian noise in the gravitational potential. Probably most of this noise is due to substructures in the dark-matter halo. We show that this hypothesis naturally reproduces most of the properties of the snail. In particular it predicts correctly, with no free parameters, that the apparent age of the snail will be $ \sim 0.5$ Gyr. An important ingredient of this model is that any snail-like feature in the solar neighbourhood, whatever its cause, is erased by scattering from giant molecular clouds or other small-scale structure on a time-scale $\lesssim 1$ Gyr. |

|**Abstract**| The flight of the Micro-X sounding rocket on July 22, 2018 marked the first operation of Transition-Edge Sensors and their SQUID readouts in space. The instrument combines the microcalorimeter array with an imaging mirror to take high-resolution spectra from extended X-ray sources. The first flight target was the Cassiopeia~A Supernova Remnant. While a rocket pointing malfunction led to no time on-target, data from the flight was used to evaluate the performance of the instrument and demonstrate the flight viability of the payload. The instrument successfully achieved a stable cryogenic environment, executed all flight operations, and observed X-rays from the on-board calibration source. The flight environment did not significantly affect the performance of the detectors compared to ground operation. The flight provided an invaluable test of the impact of external magnetic fields and the instrument configuration on detector performance. This flight provides a milestone in the flight readiness of these detector and readout technologies, both of which have been selected for future X-ray observatories. |

|**Abstract**| The Near Infrared Camera for the James Webb Space Telescope is delivering the imagery that astronomers have hoped for ever since JWST was proposed back in the 1990s. In the Commissioning Period that extended from right after launch to early July 2022 NIRCam has been subjected to a number of performance tests and operational checks. The camera is exceeding pre-launch expectations in virtually all areas with very few surprises discovered in flight. NIRCam also delivered the imagery needed by the Wavefront Sensing Team for use in aligning the telescope mirror segments (\citealt{Acton_etal2022}, \citealt{McElwain_etal2022}). |

|**Abstract**| Satellite galaxies undergo a variety of physical processes when they are accreted by groups and clusters, often resulting in the loss of baryonic and dark matter (DM) mass. In this work, we evaluate the predictions from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation regarding the evolution of the matter content of satellites, focusing on a population that are accreted at $z>1$ and retain their identity as satellites down to $z=0$. At fixed host halo mass, the amount of DM and stellar mass stripped depends mostly on the pericentric distance, $d_{\rm peri}$, here normalised by host halo virial radius. The closest encounters result in significant loss of DM, with subhaloes retaining between 20 and a few per cent of their $z=1$ mass. At fixed $d_{\rm peri}$, DM mass stripping seems more severe in lower mass haloes. Conversely, the average satellite in higher mass haloes has its stellar mass growth halted earlier, having lost a higher fraction of stellar mass by $z=0$. We also show that mass stripping has a strong impact on the quenched fractions. The IllustrisTNG boxes are qualitatively consistent in these predictions, with quantitative differences mostly originating from the distinct subhalo mass ranges covered by the boxes. Finally, we have identified DM-deficient systems in all TNG boxes. These objects are preferentially found in massive clusters ($M_{\rm host } \gtrsim 10^{13}$ M$_\odot$), had very close encounters with their central galaxies ($d_{\rm peri}\simeq0.05\, R_{\rm vir}$), and were accreted at high redshift ($z_{\rm infall} \gtrsim 1.4$), reinforcing the notion that tidal stripping is responsible for their remarkable lack of DM. |

|**Abstract**| With over 100 years of solar observations, the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (KoSO) is a one-of-a-kind solar data repository in the world. Among its many data catalogues, the `suncharts' at KoSO are of particular interest. These Suncharts (1904-2020) are coloured drawings of different solar features, such as sunspots, plages, filaments, and prominences, made on papers with a Stonyhurst latitude-longitude grid etched on them. In this paper, we analyze this unique data by first digitizing each suncharts using an industry-standard scanner and saving those digital images in high-resolution `.tif' format. We then examine the Cycle~19 and Cycle~20 data (two of the strongest cycles of the last century) with the aim of detecting filaments. To this end, we employed `k-means clustering' method and obtained different filament parameters such as position, tilt angle, length, and area. Our results show that filament length (and area) increases with latitude and the pole-ward migration is clearly dominated by a particular tilt sign. Lastly, we cross-verified our findings with results from KoSO digitized photographic plate database for the overlapping time period and obtained a good agreement between them. This work, acting as a proof-of-the-concept, will kick-start new efforts to effectively use the entire hand-drawn series of multi-feature, full-disk solar data and enable researchers to extract new sciences, such as the generation of pseudo magnetograms for the last 100 years. |

|**Abstract**| A spectral variation accompanied with flux variability is a commonly-observed phenomenon for blazars. In order to further investigate the optical spectral feature of blazars, we have collected the long-term optical V and R band data of 27 blazars (14 BL Lacs and 13 FSRQs), and calculated their optical spectral indices. The results show that the spectral indices vary with respect to the brightness for all of these blazars. In general, the optical spectrum progressively becomes flatter (or steeper), when the brightness increases. However the spectrum changes more and more slowly, until it tends to be stable. In other words, the source becomes bluer (or redder) and then gradually stabilizes when it brightens, which are briefly named the bluer-stable-when-brighter (BSWB) and redder-stable-when-brighter (RSWB) behaviors, respectively. Thirteen of the 14 BL Lacs show the BSWB behavior, with an exception of AO 0235+164. On the contrary, most of FSRQs (10 out of 13) exhibit the RSWB trend. It is confirmed that blazars follow the two universal optical spectral behaviors, namely, BSWB and RSWB. The model of two constant-spectral-index components can well explain the optical spectral features qualitatively and quantitatively. The results illustrate that the optical emission are mainly composed of two stable-color components, i.e., less variable thermal emission and high variable synchrotron radiation. And in most cases, the thermal component of FSRQs is redder than that of synchrotron radiation, whereas BL Lacs are the opposite. |

|**Abstract**| We studied 89 A- and F-type members of the Pleiades open cluster, including five escaped members. We measured projected rotational velocities (v sin i) for 49 stars and confirmed that stellar rotation causes a broadening of the main sequence in the color-magnitude diagram. Using time-series photometry from NASA's TESS Mission (plus one star observed by Kepler/K2), we detected delta Scuti pulsations in 36 stars. The fraction of Pleiades stars in the middle of the instability strip that pulsate is unusually high (over 80%), and their range of effective temperatures agrees well with theoretical models. On the other hand, the characteristics of the pulsation spectra are varied and do not correlate with stellar temperature, calling into question the existence of a useful nu_max relation for delta Scutis, at least for young stars. By including delta Scuti stars observed in the Kepler field, we show that the instability strip is shifted to the red with increasing distance by interstellar reddening. Overall, this work demonstrates the power of combining observations with Gaia and TESS for studying pulsating stars in open clusters. |

|**Abstract**| The microwave spectrum contains valuable information about solar flares. Yet, the present spectral coverage is far from complete and broad data gaps exist above 20 GHz. Here we report the first flare (the X2.2 flare on 2022 April 20) observation of the newly-built Chashan Broadband Solar millimeter spectrometer (CBS) working from 35 to 40 GHz. We use the CBS data of the new Moon to calibrate,and the simultaneous NoRP data at 35 GHz to cross-calibrate. The impulsive stage has three local peaks with the middle one being the strongest and the maximum flux density reaches 9300 SFU at 35-40 GHz. The spectral index of the CBS data (alpha_C) for the major peak is mostly positive, indicating the gyrosynchrotron turnover frequency (nu_t) goes beyond 35-40 GHz. The frequency nu_t is smaller yet still larger than 20 GHz for most time of the other two peaks according to the spectral fittings with NoRP-CBS data. The CBS index manifests the general rapid-hardening-then-softening trend for each peak and gradual hardening during the decay stage, agreeing with the fitted optically-thin spectral index (alpha_tn) for nu_t < 35 GHz. In addition, the obtained turnover frequency during the whole impulsive stage correlates well with the corresponding intensity (I_t) according to a power-law dependence (It~nu_t^4.8) with a correlation coefficient of 0.82.This agrees with earlier studies on flares with low turnover frequency (<17 GHz), yet being reported for the first time for events with a high turnover frequency (>20 GHz). |

|**Abstract**| Although type Ia supernovae are so important in many astrophysical field, e.g. in cosmology, their explosion mechanism and progenitor system are still unclear. In physics, the relative equivalent width (REW) of the Si II 635.5 nm absorption feature reflects the velocity interval of silicon in the supernova ejecta and then may provide constraints on the explosion mechanism of SNe Ia. In this paper, we divide the SNe Ia into broad line (BL) and normal line (NL) subsamples based on their REW of Si II 635.5 nm absorption lines around maximum light, and find that the BL SNe Ia have a dimmer mean brightness than NL ones, which possibly results from their different metallicities. However, based on the pixel statistics study on the environments of two subsamples, we do not find any significant potential difference on the environments between BL and NL SNe Ia, which implies that the explosion mechanism of SNe Ia could be independent of their progenitor populations. |

|**Abstract**| An increase in satellite application has skyrocketed the number of satellites, especially in the low earth orbit (LEO). The major concern today is that these satellites become debris after the end of life, negatively affecting the space environment. As per the International Guidelines of the European Space Agency, it is mandatory to deorbit the satellite within 25 years of its end of life. This paper is aimed to design the solid chemical propellant thruster to deorbit the StudSat II from its original orbit to the lower orbit. StudSat II carries the heritage of StudSat I, successfully launched on 12th July 2010 AD, and is the first Pico Satellite in India by the undergraduate students of seven engineering colleges. This paper explains how a solid monopropellant thruster could be used to deorbit the satellite after the end of life with the least difficulty compared to other active and passive methods of deorbiting. The deorbiting mechanism consists of a solid propellant, Convergent Divergent nozzle, ignition system, and electronic actuators. The components of the thruster were designed in the CATIA V5, and the combustion studies and flow analysis were done in ANSYS. The concept of Hohmann transfer was used to deorbit the satellite, and STK was used to simulate it. |
