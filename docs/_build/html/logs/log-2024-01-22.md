|**Abstract**| The spectra of high-redshift ($z\gtrsim 6$) quasars contain valuable information on the progression of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). At redshifts $z<6$, the observed Lyman-series forest shows that the intergalactic medium (IGM) is nearly ionized, while at $z>7$ the observed quasar damping wings indicate high neutral gas fractions. However, there remains a gap in neutral gas fraction constraints at $6\lesssim z \lesssim 7$ where the Lyman series forest becomes saturated but damping wings have yet to fully emerge. In this work, we use a sample of 18 quasar spectra at redshifts $6.0<z<7.1$ to close this gap. We apply neural networks to reconstruct the quasars' continuum emission around the partially absorbed Lyman $\alpha$ line to normalize their spectra, and stack these continuum-normalized spectra in three redshift bins. To increase the robustness of our results, we compare the stacks to a grid of models from two hydrodynamical simulations, ATON and CROC, and we measure the volume-averaged neutral gas fraction, $\bar{x}_{\rm HI}$, while jointly fitting for the mean quasar lifetime, $t_{\rm Q}$, for each stacked spectrum. We chronicle the evolution of neutral gas fraction using the ATON (CROC) models as follows: $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.21_{-0.07}^{+0.17}$ ($\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.10_{<10^{-4}}^{+0.73}$) at $\langle z \rangle =6.10$, $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.21_{-0.07}^{+0.33}$ ($\bar{x}_{\rm HI} =0.57_{-0.47}^{+0.26}$) at $\langle z \rangle =6.46$, and $\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.37_{-0.17}^{+0.17}$ ($\bar{x}_{\rm HI} =0.57_{-0.21}^{+0.26}$) at $\langle z \rangle =6.87$. At the same time we constrain the average quasar lifetime to be $t_{\rm Q} \lesssim 7\ {\rm Myr}$ across all redshift bins, in good agreement with previous studies. |

|**Abstract**| Open clusters (OCs) are common in the Milky Way, but most of them remain undiscovered. There are numerous techniques, including some machine-learning algorithms, available for the exploration of OCs. However, each method has its own limitations and therefore, different approaches to discovering OCs hold significant value. We develop a comprehensive approach method to automatically explore the data space and identify potential OC candidates with relatively reliable membership determination. This approach combines the techniques of HDBSCAN, GMM, and a novel cluster member identification technique, 2-color constraint. The new method exhibits efficiency in detecting OCs while ensuring precise determination of cluster memberships. Because the main feature of this technique is to add an extra constraint for the members of cluster candidates using the homogeneity of color excess, comparing to typical blind search codes, it is called Blind Search-Extra Constraint (BSEC) method. It is successfully applied to the Gaia Data Release 3, and 83 new OCs with CMDs similar to stellar isochrones are found. In addition, this study reports 621 new OC candidates including at least the main sequence or red giant branch. It is shown that BSEC technique can discard some false negatives of previous works, which takes about 3 percentage of known clusters. It shows that color excess (or 2-color) constraint is useful for removing fake cluster member stars and getting more precise CMDs. It makes the CMDs of 15 percent clusters clearer (in particular for the region near turnoff) and therefore is helpful for CMD and stellar population studies.
