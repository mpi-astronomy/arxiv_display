|**Abstract**| The chemical composition of globular clusters (GCs) across the Local Group provides information on chemical abundance trends. The host galaxy, Sextans A, is a low-surface-brightness dwarf irregular galaxy located on the edge of the Local Group.We derive the dynamical mass of the GC together with the mass-to-light ratio and the abundances of the ${\alpha}$ (Mg, Ca, Ti, Si), Fe-peak (Fe, Cr, Mn, Sc, Ni), and heavy elements (Ba, Cu, Zn, Eu). Abundance ratios were determined from the analysis of an optical integrated-light spectrum of Sextans A GC-1, obtained with UVES on the VLT. We apply non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) corrections to Mg, Ca, Ti, Fe, and Ni. The GC appears to be younger and more metal-poor than the majority of the GCs of the Milky Way, with an age of 8.6$\pm$2.7 Gyr and $\text{[Fe/H]}=-2.14\pm0.04$ dex. The calculated dynamical mass is $(5.18 \pm1.62) \times 10^5 M_{\odot}$, which results in an atypically high value of the mass-to-light ratio, 4.35$\pm$1.40 M$_{\odot}$/L$_{V \odot}$. Sextans A GC-1 has varying $\alpha$ elements - the Mg abundance is extremely low ($\text{[Mg/Fe]}=-0.79\pm0.29$), Ca and Ti are solar-scaled or mildly enhanced, and Si is enhanced. This makes the mean $\alpha$ abundance (excluding Mg) to be enhanced. The Fe-peak elements are consistent with scaled-solar or slightly enhanced abundances. Ba and Cu have sub-solar abundance ratios, while Zn and Eu are consistent with their upper limits being solar-scaled and enhanced. The composition of Sextans A GC-1 resembles the overall pattern and behaviour of GCs in the Local Group. The anomalous values are the mass-to-light ratio and the depleted abundance of Mg. There is no definite explanation for such an extreme abundance value. Variations in the initial mass function or the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole might explain the high mass-to-light ratio value. |

|**Abstract**| Double neutron star (DNS) systems offer excellent opportunities to test gravity theories. We report the timing results of a pulsar, PSR J1901+0658, discovered in the FAST Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot (GPPS) survey. Based on timing observations by FAST over 5 years, we obtain the phase-coherent timing solutions and derive the precise measurements of its position, spin parameters, orbital parameters, and also the dispersion measure (DM). It has a period of 75.7 ms, a period derivative of 2.169(6)$\times 10^{-19}$ s s$^{-1}$, and the characteristic age of 5.5 Gyr. This pulsar is in an orbit with a period of 14.45 days and an eccentricity of 0.366. One post-Keplerian parameter, periastron advance, has been well measured as being 0.00531(9) deg/yr, from which the total mass of this system is derived to be 2.79(7) $M_{\sun}$. The pulsar has the upper limit of mass of 1.68 $M_{\sun}$, so the lower limit for the companion mass is 1.11 $M_{\sun}$. Because PSR J1901+0658 is a partially recycled pulsar in an eccentric binary orbit with such a large companion mass, it should be in a DNS system according to the evolution history of the binary system. |
