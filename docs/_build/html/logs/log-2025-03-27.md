|**Abstract**|            We report the discovery and characterization of TOI-2005b, a warm Jupiter on an eccentric (e~0.59), 17.3-day orbit around a V_mag = 9.867 rapidly rotating F-star. The object was detected as a candidate by TESS and the planetary nature of TOI-2005b was then confirmed via a series of ground-based photometric, spectroscopic, and diffraction-limited imaging observations. The planet was found to reside in a low sky-projected stellar obliquity orbit (lambda = 4.8 degrees) via a transit spectroscopic observation using the Magellan MIKE this http URL-2005b is one of a few planets known to have a low-obliquity, high-eccentricity orbit, which may be the result of high-eccentricity coplanar migration. The planet has a periastron equilibrium temperature of ~ 2100 K, similar to some highly irradiated hot Jupiters where atomic metal species have been detected in transmission spectroscopy, and varies by almost 1000 K during its orbit. Future observations of the atmosphere of TOI-2005b can inform us about its radiative timescales thanks to the rapid heating and cooling of the planet.         |

|**Abstract**|            Utilizing the PHOENIX synthetic spectra, we investigated the impact of spectral resolution on the calculation of $S$-indices. We found that for spectra with a resolution lower than $\approx$30,000, it is crucial to calibrate $S$-indices for accurate estimations. This is especially essential for low-resolution spectral observations. We provided calibrations for several ongoing or upcoming spectroscopic surveys such as the LAMOST low-resolution survey, the SEGUE survey, the SDSS-V/BOSS survey, the DESI survey, the MSE survey, and the MUST survey. Using common targets between the HARPS and MWO observations, we established conversions from spectral $S$-indices to the well-known $S_{\rm MWO}$ values, applicable to stars with [Fe/H] values greater than $-$1. These calibrations offer a reliable approach to convert $S$-indices obtained from various spectroscopic surveys into $S_{\rm{MWO}}$ values and can be widely applied in studies on chromospheric activity.         |
