|**Abstract**| In preparation for the release of the astrometric orbits of Gaia, Shahaf et al. (2019) proposed a triage technique to identify astrometric binaries with compact companions based on their astrometric semi-major axis, parallax, and primary mass. The technique requires the knowledge of the appropriate mass-luminosity relation to rule out single or close-binary main-sequence companions. The recent publication of the Gaia DR3 astrometric orbits used a schematic version of this approach, identifying 735 astrometric binaries that might have compact companions. In this communication, we return to the triage of the DR3 astrometric binaries with more careful analysis, estimating the probability for its astrometric secondary to be a compact object or a main-sequence close binary. We compile a sample of 177 systems with highly-probable non-luminous massive companions, which is smaller but cleaner than the sample reported in Gaia DR3. The new sample includes 8 candidates to be black-hole systems with compact-object masses larger than 2.4 $M_\odot$. The orbital-eccentricity$-$secondary-mass diagram of the other 169 systems suggests a tentative separation between the white-dwarf and the neutron-star binaries. Most white-dwarf binaries are characterized by small eccentricities of about 0.1 and masses of 0.6 $M_\odot$, while the neutron star binaries display typical eccentricities of 0.4 and masses of 1.3 $M_\odot$. |

|**Abstract**| We introduce our Radial Velocity Survey for Planets around Young stars (RVSPY), characterise our target stars, and search for substellar companions at orbital separations smaller than a few au from the host star. We use the FEROS spectrograph to obtain high signal-to-noise spectra and time series of precise radial velocities (RVs) of 111 stars most of which are surrounded by debris discs. Our target stars have spectral types between early F and late K, a median age of 400 Myr, and a median distance of 45 pc. We determine for all target stars their basic stellar parameters and present the results of the high-cadence RV survey and activity characterization. We achieve a median single-measurement RV precision of 6 m/s and derive the short-term intrinsic RV scatter of our targets (median 22 m/s), which is mostly caused by stellar activity and decays with age from >100 m/s at <20 Myr to <20 m/s at >500 Myr. We discover six previously unknown close companions with orbital periods between 10 and 100 days, three of which are low-mass stars, and three are in the brown dwarf mass regime. We detect no hot companion with an orbital period <10 days down to a median mass limit of ~1 M_Jup for stars younger than 500 Myr, which is still compatible with the established occurrence rate of such companions around main-sequence stars. We find significant RV periodicities between 1.3 and 4.5 days for 14 stars, which are, however, all caused by rotational modulation due to starspots. We also analyse the TESS photometric time series data and find significant periodicities for most of the stars. For 11 stars, the photometric periods are also clearly detected in the RV data. We also derive stellar rotation periods ranging from 1 to 10 days for 91 stars, mostly from TESS data. From the intrinsic activity-related short-term RV jitter, we derive the expected mass-detection thresholds for longer-period companions. |

|**Abstract**| WEAVE is the new wide-field spectroscopic facility for the prime focus of the William Herschel Telescope in La Palma, Spain. Its fibre positioner is essential for the accurate placement of the spectrograph's ~960-fibre multiplex. To maximise the assignment of its optical fibres, WEAVE uses a simulated annealing algorithm called Configure, which allocates the fibres to targets in the field of view. We have conducted an analysis of the algorithm's behaviour using a subset of mid-tier WEAVE-LOFAR fields, and adjusted the priority assignment algorithm to optimise the total fibres assigned per field, and the assignment of fibres to the higher priority science targets. The output distributions have been examined, to investigate the implications for the WEAVE science teams. |

|**Abstract**| WEAVE is the new wide-field spectroscopy facility for the prime focus of the William Herschel Telescope in La Palma, Spain. Its fibre positioner is essential for the accurate placement of the spectrograph's 960 fibre multiplex. We provide an overview of the recent maintenance, flexure modifications, and calibration measurements conducted at the observatory prior to the final top-end assembly. This work ensures that we have a complete understanding of the positioner's behaviour as it changes orientation during observations. All fibre systems have been inspected and repaired, and the tumbler structure contains new clamps to stiffen both the internal beam and the retractor support disk onto which the field plates attach. We present the updated metrology procedures and results that will be verified on-sky. |

|**Abstract**| We started a survey with CHARA/MIRC-X and VLTI/GRAVITY to search for low mass companions orbiting individual components of intermediate mass binary systems. With the incredible precision of these instruments, we can detect astrometric "wobbles" from companions down to a few tens of micro-arcseconds. This allows us to detect any previously unseen triple systems in our list of binaries. We present the orbits of 12 companions around early F to B-type binaries, 9 of which are new detections and 3 of which are first astrometric detections of known RV companions. The masses of these newly detected components range from 0.45-1.3 solar masses. Our orbits constrain these systems to a high astrometric precision, with median residuals to the orbital fit of 20-50 micro-arcseconds in most cases. For 7 of these systems we include newly obtained radial velocity data, which help us to identify the system configuration and to solve for masses of individual components in some cases. Although additional RV measurements are needed to break degeneracy in the mutual inclination, we find that the majority of these inner triples are not well-aligned with the wide binary orbit. This hints that higher mass triples are more misaligned compared to solar and lower mass triples, though a thorough study of survey biases is needed. We show that the ARMADA survey is extremely successful at uncovering previously unseen companions in binaries. This method will be used in upcoming papers to constrain companion demographics in intermediate mass binary systems down to the planetary mass regime. |

|**Abstract**| We report the serendipitous discovery of an elliptical shell of CO associated with the faint stellar object SSTc2d J163134.1-24006 as part of the "Ophiuchus Disk Survey Employing ALMA" (ODISEA), a project aiming to study the entire population of protoplanetary disks in the Ophiuchus Molecular Cloud from 230 GHz continuum emission and $^{12}$CO (J=2-1), $^{13}$CO (J=2-1) and C$^{18}$CO (J=2-1) lines readable in Band-6. Remarkably, we detect a bright $^{12}$CO elliptical shape emission of $\sim$ 3$^{"}$ $\times$ 4$^{"}$ towards SSTc2d J163134.1-24006 without a 230 GHz continuum detection. Based on the observed near-IR spectrum taken with the Very Large Telescope (KMOS), the brightness of the source, its 3-dimensional motion, and Galactic dynamic arguments, we conclude that the source is not a giant star in the distant background ($>$5 - 10 kpc) and is most likely to be a young brown dwarf in the Ophiuchus cloud, at a distance of just $\sim$139 pc. This is the first report of quasi-spherical mass loss in a young brown dwarf. We suggest that the observed shell could be associated with a thermal pulse produced by the fusion of deuterium, which is not yet well understood, but for a sub-stellar object is expected to occur during a short period of time at an age of a few Myr, in agreement with the ages of the objects in the region. Other more exotic scenarios, such as a merger with planetary companions, cannot be ruled out from the current observations. |

|*Comments*| *8 pages, 5 figures, MNRAS in press. The cosmoSIS modules for the massE ruler is at this https URL*|
|**Abstract**| Distance-redshift diagrams probe expansion history of the Universe. We show that the stellar mass-binding energy (massE) relation of galaxies proposed in our previous study offers a new distance ruler at cosmic scales. By using elliptical galaxies in the main galaxy sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, we construct a distance-redshift diagram over the redshift range from 0.05 to 0.2 with the massE ruler. The best-fit dark energy density is 0.675+-0.079 for flat Lambda-CDM, consistent with those by other probes. At the median redshift of 0.11, the median distance is estimated to have a fractional error of 0.34%, much lower than those by supernova (SN) Ia and baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) and even exceeding their future capability at this redshift. The above low-z measurement is useful for probing dark energy that dominates at the late Universe. For a flat dark energy equation of state model (flat wCDM), the massE alone constrains w to an error that is only a factor of 2.2, 1.7 and 1.3 times larger than those by BAO, SN Ia, and cosmic microwave background (CMB), respectively. |

|**Abstract**| We study the impact of local environment on the transformation of spiral galaxies in three nearby ($z < 0.08$) Abell clusters: A85/A496/A2670. These systems were observed in HI with the Very Large Array, covering a volume extending beyond the virial radius and detecting 10, 58, 38 galaxies, respectively. High fractions (0.40--0.86) of bright spirals [log$(M_{*}/M_{\odot})=9-10$] are not detected in HI. We provide further evidence of environmental effects consisting in significant fractions (0.10--0.33) of abnormal objects and a number of red (passive) spirals, suggesting an ongoing process of quenching. Ram-pressure profiles, and the sample of the brightest spirals used as test particles for environmental effects, indicate that ram-pressure plays an important role in stripping and transforming late-types. Phase-space diagrams and our search for substructures helped to trace the dynamical stage of the three systems. This was used to compare the global cluster effects $vs.$ pre-processing, finding that the former is the dominating mechanism in the studied clusters. By contrasting the global distribution of HI normal $vs.$ HI disturbed spirals in the combined three clusters, we confirm the expected correlation of disturbed objects located, on average, at shorter projected radii. However, individual clusters do not necessarily follow this trend and we show that A496 and A2670 present an atypical behavior. In general we provide conclusive evidence about the dependence of the transformation of infalling spirals on the ensemble of cluster properties like mass, ICM density, dynamical stage and surrounding large-scale structure. |

|**Abstract**| Time-domain (TD) spectroscopic data from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) can provide accurate and high-cadence radial velocities (RVs). In this work, we search for binaries with compact components with RV monitoring method by using the LAMOST TD survey of four $K$2 plates. Three binary systems including an unseen white dwarf or neutron star are found. For each binary system, we estimate the stellar parameters of the visible star and orbital parameters, and finally calculate the binary mass function and the minimum mass of the unseen star. No obvious double-lined feature is seen from the LAMOST medium-resolution spectra of the three sources. In addition, we found no X-ray counterpart for all these sources but UV companions for two of them. Spectral disentangling also shows no additional component with optical absorption spectra, supporting that these systems contain compact objects. |

|*Appeared on*| *2022-09-05*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**| Context. After landing on C-type asteroid Ryugu, MASCOT imaged brightly colored, submillimeter-sized inclusions in a small rock. Hayabusa2 successfully returned a sample of small particles from the surface of Ryugu, but none of these appear to harbor such inclusions. The samples are considered representative of Ryugu. Aims. To understand the apparent discrepancy between MASCOT observations and Ryugu samples, we assess whether the MASCOT landing site, and the rock by implication, is perhaps atypical for Ryugu. Methods. We analyzed observations of the MASCOT landing area acquired by three instruments on board Hayabusa2: a camera (ONC), a near-infrared spectrometer (NIRS3), and a thermal infrared imager (TIR). We compared the landing area properties thus retrieved with those of the average Ryugu surface. Results. We selected several areas and landforms in the landing area for analysis: a small crater, a collection of smooth rocks, and the landing site itself. The crater is relatively blue and the rocks are relatively red. The spectral and thermophysical properties of the landing site are very close to those of the average Ryugu surface. The spectral properties of the MASCOT rock are probably close to average, but its thermal inertia may be somewhat higher. Conclusions. The MASCOT rock can also be considered representative of Ryugu. Some of the submillimeter-sized particles in the returned samples stand out because of their atypical spectral properties. Such particles may be present as inclusions in the MASCOT rock. |

|**Abstract**| Recently, there has been an increasing demand for deep imaging surveys to investigate the history of the mass assembly of galaxies in detail by examining the remnants of mergers and accretions, both of which have very low surface brightness (LSB). In addition, the nature of star formation in LSB regions, such as galaxy outer disks, is also an intriguing topic in terms of understanding the physical mechanisms of disk evolution. To address these issues, this study conducts a survey project, called the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) Nearby Galaxy Survey to construct a deep imaging data set of nearby galaxies in the southern hemisphere using KMTNet. It provides deep and wide-field images with a field-of-view of $\sim$12 deg$^2$ for 13 nearby galaxies drawn from the Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey catalog, in optical broadbands ($BRI$) and an H$\alpha$ narrowband. Through a dedicated data reduction, the surface brightness limit in 10$^{\prime\prime}\times10^{\prime\prime}$ boxes was found to reach as deep as $\mu_{1\sigma}\sim29$-31 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the optical broadbands and $f_{1\sigma}\sim1$-$2\times 10^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ in the H$\alpha$ narrowband. To conclude the paper, several possible scientific applications for this data set are described. |

|**Abstract**| For the past decade, it has been suggested that intermediate polars (IPs), a subclass of magnetic cataclysmic variables (CVs), are one of the main contributors to the hard diffuse X-ray emission from the Galactic center (GC) and Galactic ridge. In our ongoing \emph{XMM-Newton} survey of the central region of the Galactic disk ($20^\circ\times2^\circ$), we detected a persistent IP candidate, $1.7^\circ$ away from the GC. In this work, we better characterize the behavior of this source by looking at the new and archival XMM-Newton data. We performed a detailed X-ray spectral modeling of the source. Furthermore, we searched for X-ray pulsations in the light curve as well as its counterpart at other wavelengths. The XMM-Newton spectrum (0.8--10 keV) of the source is described by a partial covering collisionally ionized diffuse gas with plasma temperature $kT=15.7^{+20.9}_{-3.6}$ keV. In addition, the spectrum shows the presence of iron lines at $E=6.44$, 6.65, and 6.92 keV with equivalent widths of $194^{+89}_{-70}$, $115^{+79}_{-75}$, and $98^{+93}_{-74}$ eV, respectively. The X-ray light curve shows a coherent modulation with a period of $P=432.44\pm0.36$ s, which we infer is the spin period of the white dwarf. The white dwarf mass estimated from fitting a physical model to the spectrum results in $M_{\rm WD}=1.05^{+0.16}_{-0.21}\ M_{\odot}$. We were able to find a likely optical counterpart in the Gaia catalog with a G magnitude of 19.26, and the distance to the source derived from the measured Gaia parallax is $\sim$4.3 kpc. We provide an improved source localization with subarcsec accuracy. The spectral modeling of the source indicates the presence of intervening circumstellar gas, which absorbs the soft X-ray photons. The measured equivalent width of the iron lines and the detection of the spin period in the light curve are consistent with those from IPs. |

|**Abstract**| We present the physical and dynamical properties of the recently discovered active asteroid (248370) 2005 QN173 (aka 433P). From our observations, we derived two possible rotation period solutions of 2.7 and 4.1 hours. The corresponding light curve amplitudes computed after correcting for the effect of coma are 0.28 and 0.58 mag, respectively. Both period solutions are shorter than the critical rotation limit computed for a strengthless triaxial ellipsoid, suggesting that rotation mass shedding should at least partly be responsible for the observed activity. We confirm that the activity level is fading further, but at a very modest rate of only 0.006 mag/day, still also compatible with sublimation-driven activity. We found that 248370 likely belongs to the Themis asteroid family, making it a fourth main-belt comet associated with this group. Orbital characteristics of 248370 are also consistent with its origin in the young 288P cluster of asteroids. The 288P cluster is associated with its namesake main-belt comet, providing an exciting possibility for a comparative analysis of intriguing main-belt comets 248370 and 288P. |

|**Abstract**| The importance of photometric galaxy redshift estimation is rapidly increasing with the development of specialised powerful observational facilities. We develop a new photometric redshift estimation workflow TOPz to provide reliable and efficient redshift estimations for the upcoming large-scale survey J-PAS which will observe 8500 deg2 of the northern sky through 54 narrow-band filters. TOPz relies on template-based photo-z estimation with some added J-PAS specific features and possibilities. We present TOPz performance on data from the miniJPAS survey, a precursor to the J-PAS survey with an identical filter system. First, we generated spectral templates based on the miniJPAS sources using the synthetic galaxy spectrum generation software CIGALE. Then we applied corrections to the input photometry by minimising systematic offsets from the template flux in each filter. To assess the accuracy of the redshift estimation, we used spectroscopic redshifts from the DEEP2, DEEP3, and SDSS surveys, available for 1989 miniJPAS galaxies with r < 22 magAB. We also tested how the choice and number of input templates, photo-z priors, and photometric corrections affect the TOPz redshift accuracy. The general performance of the combination of miniJPAS data and the TOPz workflow fulfills the expectations for J-PAS redshift accuracy. Similarly to previous estimates, we find that 38.6% of galaxies with r < 22 mag reach the J-PAS redshift accuracy goal of dz/(1 + z) < 0.003. Limiting the number of spectra in the template set improves the redshift accuracy up to 5%, especially for fainter, noise-dominated sources. Further improvements will be possible once the actual J-PAS data become available. |
