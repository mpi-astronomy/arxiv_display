|**Abstract**|            We present a comprehensive analysis of transit, eclipse, and radial velocity data of the hot Jupiter TrES-1 b and confirm evidence of orbital variations on secular timescales. Apparent variations due to systemic motion and light travel time effects have been ruled out, indicating that the observed changes are dynamical in origin. Joint modeling of the TrES-1 b data favors an apsidal precession model, but the rapid precession rate of $4^\circ$ yr$^{-1}$ cannot be explained without invoking an undetected close-in planetary companion, which remains unseen in the data. While radial velocity measurements reveal a previously undetected companion candidate on a wide, eccentric orbit, it is unlikely to drive the observed evolution of TrES-1 b. However, an orbital decay model provides a plausible alternative if the loss of orbital energy is driven by planetary obliquity tides. We find that the best-fit orbital decay rate of $-7.1^{ +1.5}_{-1.6}$ ms yr$^{-1}$ is aligned with theoretical predictions for modified tidal quality factors of hot Jupiters if TrES-1 b has a planetary obliquity $\varepsilon_p > 30^\circ$. We encourage follow-up observations of this system, particularly of eclipse timing and radial velocities, to further constrain the nature of the observed evolution. This paper provides a practical framework for studying secular variations and aims to accelerate future research on similar systems.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report on the simultaneous monitoring of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) 20240114A at 2.25 and 8.60~GHz, conducted 66 times between 2024 January 29 and 2025 February 15 with the Shanghai Tianma Radio Telescope (TMRT). In about 180 hours of observation, we detected 155 bursts at 2.25~GHz above a fluence threshold of 0.72~Jy~ms, but none at 8.60~GHz above a fluence threshold of 0.27~Jy~ms. FRB~20240114A exhibited frequency-dependent activity, as evidenced by the non-detections in 14.3 hours of observations at 2.25~GHz prior to 2024 February 24, despite its reported activity below 2~GHz. In contrast to its low-activity state reported below 1.4~GHz between 2024 June and December, FRB~20240114A exhibited high activity at 2.25~GHz in 2024 July with a mean burst rate of $1.72^{+0.18}_{-0.16}~\rm{hr}^{-1}$, followed by a low-activity state. We also detected a short-term reactivation at 2.25~GHz around 2025 January 20, about two weeks after renewed activity was reported below 1.4~GHz by other telescopes. The median burst width at 2.25~GHz is 3~ms, which is narrower than that at lower frequencies. The waiting time distribution peaks at 1019~s, and burst arrivals on hourly timescales consistent with a Poisson process. The isotropic-equivalent energy of bursts spans $10^{37} -10^{39}$~erg. The distribution of burst energy above the completeness threshold ($7.5\times10^{37}$~erg) follows a power-law relation with an index of $\gamma=-1.20\pm0.03\pm0.02$. Finally, we find that FRB~20240114A is at least two orders of magnitude less active at 8.60~GHz than at 2.25~GHz, and we constrain the broadband spectra of the detected bursts.         |

|| T. M. Eubanks, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Schneider</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-08-22*|
|*Comments*| *Intended for submission to New Astronomy*|
|**Abstract**|            The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS (also C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), henceforth, 3I), discovered by the ATLAS Chile telescope on 2025 July 1, was rapidly revealed to be the third known interstellar object (ISO) transiting the solar system, with an incoming velocity at infinity of 57.9763 $\pm$ 0.0044 km s$^{-1}$. An examination of 3I's pre-encounter kinematics shows that it is likely to be an object from the galactic thick disk, and thus a remnant of the Galaxy's ``cosmic noon'' period of intense star formation $\sim$9 - 13 gigayears ago. This kinematic assignment of 3I to the thick disk can be tested observationally in the transit of 3I through the solar system. Unfortunately for terrestrial observers, the 3I perihelion will happen when it is on the other side of the Sun as seen from Earth, at a solar elongation of 12.80 degrees, rendering observation from Earth (or near-Earth space telescopes) hard or impossible. With a retrograde orbit inclined 175.114 degrees (only 4.886 degrees from the ecliptic plane), and a trajectory passing inside the orbit of Mars, 3I will pass relatively close to a number of already launched interplanetary spacecraft. We find a strong science case for observations in the periods of the close approaches of the Psyche spacecraft on 2025 September 4, at 0.302 AU, the martian spacecraft array on 2025 October 3, and the Juice spacecraft on 2025 November 4. In addition, the Europa Clipper, Hera and even the more distant Lucy spacecraft may pass through 3I's cometary tail in the period after its perihelion passage, potentially directly observing the conditions and composition there. Spacecraft observations could, to the extent they are possible, provide the only source of spectral and imaging data during the 3I perihelion passage.         |
