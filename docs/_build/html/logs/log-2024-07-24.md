|**Abstract**|            The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)'s Medium Resolution Spectrometer (the MRS) on JWST has potentially important advantages for transit and eclipse spectroscopy of exoplanets, including lack of saturation for bright host stars, wavelength span to longward of 20 microns, and JWST's highest spectral resolving power. We here test the performance of the MRS for time series spectroscopy by observing the secondary eclipse of the bright stellar eclipsing binary R Canis Majoris. Our observations push the MRS into saturation at the shortest wavelength, more than for any currently known exoplanet system. We find strong charge migration between pixels that we mitigate using a custom data analysis pipeline. Our data analysis recovers much of the spatial charge migration by combining detector pixels at the group level, via weighting by the point spread function. We achieve nearly photon-limited performance in time series data at wavelengths longward of 5.2 microns. In 2017, Snellen et al. suggested that the MRS could be used to detect carbon dioxide absorption from the atmosphere of the temperate planet orbiting Proxima Centauri. We infer that the relative spectral response of the MRS versus wavelength is sufficiently stable to make that detection feasible. As regards the secondary eclipse of this Algol-type binary, we measure the eclipse depth by summing our spectra over the wavelengths in four channels, and also measuring the eclipse depth as observed by TESS. Those eclipse depths require a temperature for the secondary star that is significantly hotter than previous observations in the optical to near-IR, probably due to irradiation by the primary star. At full spectral resolution of the MRS, we find atomic hydrogen recombination emission lines in the secondary star, from principal quantum levels n = 7, 8, 10, and 14.         |

|**Abstract**|            The presence of dark gaps, a preferential light deficit along the bar minor axis, is observationally well known. The properties of dark gaps are thought to be associated with the properties of bars, and their spatial locations are often associated with bar resonances. However, a systematic study, testing the robustness and universality of these assumptions, is still largely missing. Here, we investigate the formation and evolution of bar-induced dark gaps using a suite of N-body models of (kinematically cold) thin and (kinematically hot) thick discs with varying thick disc mass fraction, and different thin-to-thick disc geometry. We find that dark gaps are a natural consequence of the trapping of disc stars by the bar. The properties of dark gaps (such as strength and extent) are well correlated with the properties of bars. For stronger dark gaps, the fractional mass loss along the bar minor axis can reach up to ~60-80 percent of the initial mass contained, which is redistributed within the bar. These trends hold true irrespective of the mass fraction in the thick disc and the assumed disc geometry. In all our models harbouring slow bars, none of the resonances (corotation, Inner Lindblad resonance, and 4:1 ultra-harmonic resonance) associated with the bar correspond to the location of dark gaps, thereby suggesting that the location of dark gaps is not a universal proxy for these bar resonances, in contrast with earlier studies.         |

|**Abstract**|            Understanding planet formation is important in the context of the origin of planetary systems in general and of the Solar System in particular, as well as to predict the likelihood of finding Jupiter, Neptune, and Earth analogues around other stars. We aim to precisely determine the radii and dynamical masses of transiting planets orbiting the young M star AU Mic using public photometric and spectroscopic datasets. We characterise the stellar activity and physical properties (radius, mass, density) of the transiting planets in the young AU Mic system through joint transit and radial velocity fits with Gaussian processes. We determine a radius of $R^{b}$= 4.79 +/- 0.29 R$_\oplus$, a mass of $M^{b}$= 9.0 +/- 2.7 M$_\oplus$, and a bulk density of $\rho^{b}$ = 0.49 +/- 0.16 g cm$^{-3}$ for the innermost transiting planet AU Mic b. For the second known transiting planet, AU Mic c, we infer a radius of $R^{c}$= 2.79 +/- 0.18 R$_\oplus$, a mass of $M^{c}$= 14.5 +/- 3.4 M$_\oplus$, and a bulk density of $\rho^{c}$ = 3.90 +/- 1.17 g cm$^{-3}$. According to theoretical models, AU Mic b may harbour an H2 envelope larger than 5\% by mass, with a fraction of rock and a fraction of water. AU Mic c could be made of rock and/or water and may have an H2 atmosphere comprising at most 5\% of its mass. AU Mic b has retained most of its atmosphere but might lose it over tens of millions of years due to the strong stellar radiation, while AU Mic c likely suffers much less photo-evaporation because it lies at a larger separation from its host. Using all the datasets in hand, we determine a 3$\sigma$ upper mass limit of $M^{[d]}\sin{i}$ = 8.6 M$_{\oplus}$ for the AU Mic 'd' TTV-candidate. In addition, we do not confirm the recently proposed existence of the planet candidate AU Mic 'e' with an orbital period of 33.4 days.         |

|**Abstract**|            The majority of stars in today's Universe reside within spheroids, which are bulges of spiral galaxies and elliptical galaxies. Their formation is still an unsolved problem. Infrared/submm-bright galaxies at high redshifts have long been suspected to be related to spheroids formation. Proving this connection has been hampered so far by heavy dust obscuration when focusing on their stellar emission or by methodologies and limited signal-to-noise ratios when looking at submm wavelengths. Here we show that spheroids are directly generated by star formation within the cores of highly luminous starburst galaxies in the distant Universe. This follows from the ALMA submillimeter surface brightness profiles which deviate significantly from those of exponential disks, and from the skewed-high axis-ratio distribution, both derived with a novel analysis technique. These galaxies are fully triaxial rather than flat disks: scale-height ratios are 0.5 on average and $>0.6$ for most spatially compact systems. These observations, supported by simulations, reveal a cosmologically relevant pathway for in-situ spheroid formation through starbursts likely preferentially triggered by interactions (and mergers) acting on galaxies fed by non co-planar gas accretion streams.         |

|**Abstract**|            Detecting planet signatures in protoplanetary disks is fundamental to understanding how and where planets form. In this work, we report dust and gas observational hints of planet formation in the disk around 2MASS-J16120668-301027, as part of the ALMA Large Program ``AGE-PRO: ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in Protoplanetary disks''. The disk was imaged with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at Band 6 (1.3 mm) in dust continuum emission and four molecular lines: $^{12}$CO(J=2-1), $^{13}$CO(J=2-1), C$^{18}$O(J=2-1), and H$_2$CO(J=3$_{(3,0)}$-2$_{(2,0)}$). Resolved observations of the dust continuum emission (angular resolution of $\sim 150$ mas, 20 au) show a ring-like structure with a peak at $0.57 ^{\prime \prime}$ (75 au), a deep gap with a minimum at 0.24$^{\prime \prime}$ (31 au), an inner disk, a bridge connecting the inner disk and the outer ring, along with a spiral arm structure, and a tentative detection (to $3\sigma$) of a compact emission at the center of the disk gap, with an estimated dust mass of $\sim 2.7-12.9$ Lunar masses. We also detected a kinematic kink (not coincident with any dust substructure) through several $^{12}$CO channel maps (angular resolution $\sim$ 200 mas, 30 au), located at a radius of $\sim 0.875^{\prime \prime}$ (115.6 au). After modeling the $^{12}$CO velocity rotation around the protostar, we identified a purple tentative rotating-like structure at the kink location with a geometry similar to that of the disk. We discuss potential explanations for the dust and gas substructures observed in the disk, and their potential connection to signatures of planet formation.         |

|**Abstract**|            The contribution of the magnetic field to the formation of high-mass stars is poorly understood. We report the high-angular resolution ($\sim0.3^{\prime\prime}$, 870 au) map of the magnetic field projected on the plane of the sky (B$_\mathrm{POS}$) towards the high-mass star forming region G333.46$-$0.16 (G333), obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 1.2 mm as part of the Magnetic Fields in Massive Star-forming Regions (MagMaR) survey. The B$_\mathrm{POS}$ morphology found in this region is consistent with a canonical ``hourglass'' which suggest a dynamically important field. This region is fragmented into two protostars separated by $\sim1740$ au. Interestingly, by analysing H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ ($J=3-2$) line emission, we find no velocity gradient over the extend of the continuum which is consistent with a strong field. We model the B$_\mathrm{POS}$, obtaining a marginally supercritical mass-to-flux ratio of 1.43, suggesting an initially strongly magnetized environment. Based on the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, the magnetic field strength towards G333 is estimated to be 5.7 mG. The absence of strong rotation and outflows towards the central region of G333 suggests strong magnetic braking, consistent with a highly magnetized environment. Our study shows that despite being a strong regulator, the magnetic energy fails to prevent the process of fragmentation, as revealed by the formation of the two protostars in the central region.         |
