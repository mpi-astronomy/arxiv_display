|**Abstract**| We analyse the quenched fractions, gas content, and star formation histories of ~1200 satellite galaxies with M* >= 5x10^6 Msun around 198 Milky Way- (MW) and Andromeda-like (M31) hosts in TNG50, the highest-resolution run of the IllustrisTNG simulations. Satellites exhibit larger quenched fractions for smaller masses, at smaller distances to their host galaxy, and in the more massive M31-like compared to MW-like hosts. As satellites cross their host's virial radius, their gas content drops significantly: most satellites within 300 kpc do not contain any detectable gas reservoirs at z=0, unless they are massive like the Magellanic Clouds and M32. Nevertheless, their stellar assembly exhibits a large degree of diversity. On average, the cumulative star formation histories of satellites are more extended for brighter, more massive satellites with a later infall, and for those in less massive hosts. Based on these relationships, we can even infer infall periods for observed MW and M31 dwarfs: e.g. 0-4 Gyr ago for the Magellanic Clouds and Leo I, 4-8 and 0-2 Gyr ago for M32 and IC 10, respectively. Ram pressure stripping (in combination with tidal stripping) deprives TNG50 satellites of their gas reservoirs and ultimately quenches their star formation activity, even though only a few per cent of the present-day satellites around the 198 TNG50 MW/M31-like hosts appear as jellyfish. The typical time since quenching for currently quenched TNG50 satellites is 6.9 (+2.5)(-3.3) Gyr ago. The TNG50 results are consistent with the quenched fractions and stellar assembly of observed MW and M31 satellites, however, satellites of the SAGA survey exhibit lower quenched fractions than TNG50 and other, observed analogues. |

|**Abstract**| We analyze the physical properties of gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of 132 Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies at $z=0$ from the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50, part of the IllustrisTNG project. The properties and abundance of CGM gas across the sample are diverse, and the fractional budgets of different phases (cold, warm, and hot), as well as neutral HI mass and metal mass, vary considerably. Over our stellar mass range of $10.5 < \rm{M}_\star / \rm{M}_\odot < 10.9$, radial profiles of gas physical properties from $0.15 < \rm{R/R_{\rm 200c}} < 1.0$ reveal great CGM structural complexity, with significant variations both at fixed distance around individual galaxies, and across different galaxies. CGM gas is multi-phase: the distributions of density, temperature and entropy are all multimodal, while metallicity and thermal pressure distributions are unimodal; all are broad. We present predictions for magnetic fields in MW-like halos: a median field strength of $|B|\sim\,1\mu$G in the inner halo decreases rapidly at larger distance, while magnetic pressure dominates over thermal pressure only within $\sim0.2 \times \RVIR$. Virial temperature gas at $\sim 10^6\,$K coexists with a sub-dominant cool, $< 10^5\,$K component in approximate pressure equilibrium. Finally, the physical properties of the CGM are tightly connected to the galactic star formation rate, in turn dependent on feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In TNG50, we find that energy from SMBH-driven kinetic winds generates high-velocity outflows ($\gtrsim 2000$ km/s), heats gas to super-virial temperatures ($> 10^{6.5-7}$ K), and regulates the net balance of inflows versus outflows in otherwise quasi-static gaseous halos. |

|**Abstract**| We analyze the merger and assembly histories of Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31)-like galaxies to quantify how, and how often, disk galaxies of this mass can survive recent major mergers (stellar mass ratio $\ge$ 1:4). For this, we use the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 and identify 198 analog galaxies, selected based on their $z=0$ stellar mass ($10^{10.5-11.2} {\rm M_{\odot}}$), disky stellar morphology and local environment. Firstly, major mergers are common: 85 per cent (168) of MW/M31-like galaxies in TNG50 have undergone at least one major merger across their lifetime. In fact, 31 galaxies (16 per cent) have undergone a recent major merger, i.e. in the last 5 Gyr. The gas available during the merger suffices to either induce starbursts at pericentric passages or to sustain prolonged star formation after coalescence: in roughly half of the cases, the pre-existing stellar disk is destroyed because of the merger but reforms thanks to star formation. Moreover, higher merger mass ratios are more likely to destroy the stellar disks. In comparison to those with more ancient massive mergers, MW/M31-like galaxies with recent major mergers have, on average, somewhat thicker stellar disks, more massive and somewhat shallower stellar haloes, larger stellar ex-situ mass fractions, but similarly massive kinematically-defined bulges. All this is qualitatively consistent with the different observed properties of the Galaxy and Andromeda and with the constraints on their most recent major mergers, 8-11 and ~2 Gyr ago, respectively. According to contemporary cosmological simulations, a recent quiet merger history is not a pre-requisite for obtaining a relatively-thin stellar disk at $z=0$. |

|**Abstract**| We analyse the location of extremely metal-poor stars (EMPs, [Fe/H]$ < -3$) in 198 Milky Way (MW)/M31-like galaxies at $z=0$ in the TNG50 simulation. Each system is divided into four kinematically-defined morphological stellar components based on stellar circularity and galactocentric distance, namely bulge, cold disk, warm disk, and stellar halo, in addition to satellites (with stellar mass $\ge 5\times10^6\,M_\odot$). According to TNG50 and across all simulated systems, the stellar halo of the main galaxy and satellites present the highest frequency of EMPs (largest $M_{\mathrm{EMP, comp}}$-to-$M_{\mathrm{tot, comp}}$ stellar mass ratio), and thus the highest chances of finding them. Such frequency is larger in lower-mass than high-mass satellites. Moreover, TNG50 predicts that the stellar halo of the main galaxy always hosts and thus contributes the majority of the EMPs of the system. Namely, it has the highest mass ratio of EMPs in it to all the EMPs in the system (largest $M_{\mathrm{EMP, comp}}$-to-$M_\mathrm{EMP} (<300\mathrm{kpc})$). However, notably, we also find that 33 MW/M31-like galaxies in TNG50 have cold disks that contribute more than 10 per cent to the total EMP mass, each with $\gtrsim 10^{6.5-7}\, M_\odot$ of EMPs in cold circular orbits. These qualitative statements do not depend on the precise definition of EMP stars, i.e. on the adopted metallicity threshold. The results of this work provide a theoretical prediction for the location of EMP stars from both a spatial and kinematic perspective and across an unprecedented number of well-resolved MW/M31-like systems. |

|**Abstract**| Recent surveys have discovered a population of faint supernovae, known as Ca-rich gap transients, inferred to originate from explosive ignitions of white dwarfs. In addition to their unique spectra and luminosities, these supernovae have an unusual spatial distribution and are predominantly found at large distances from their presumed host galaxies. We show that the locations of Ca-rich gap transients are well matched to the distribution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies surrounding large galaxies, in accordance with a scenario where dark matter interactions induce thermonuclear explosions among low-mass white dwarfs that may be otherwise difficult to ignite with standard stellar or binary evolution mechanisms. A plausible candidate to explain the observed event rate are primordial black holes with masses above $10^{21}$ grams. |

|**Abstract**| We present JWST near- and mid-infrared spectroscopic observations of the nearby normal Type Ia supernova SN 2021aefx in the nebular phase at $+255$ days past maximum light. Our Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI) observations, combined with ground-based optical data from the South African Large Telescope (SALT), constitute the first complete optical $+$ NIR $+$ MIR nebular SN Ia spectrum covering 0.3$-$14 $\mu$m. This spectrum unveils the previously unobserved 2.5$-$5 $\mu$m region, revealing strong nebular iron and stable nickel emission, indicative of high-density burning that can constrain the progenitor mass. The data show a significant improvement in sensitivity and resolution compared to previous Spitzer MIR data. We identify numerous NIR and MIR nebular emission lines from iron-group elements and as well as lines from the intermediate-mass element argon. The argon lines extend to higher velocities than the iron-group elements, suggesting stratified ejecta that are a hallmark of delayed-detonation or double-detonation SN Ia models. We present fits to simple geometric line profiles to features beyond 1.2 $\mu$m and find that most lines are consistent with Gaussian or spherical emission distributions, while the [Ar III] 8.99 $\mu$m line has a distinctively flat-topped profile indicating a thick spherical shell of emission. Using our line profile fits, we investigate the emissivity structure of SN 2021aefx and measure kinematic properties. Continued observations of SN 2021aefx and other SNe Ia with JWST will be transformative to the study of SN Ia composition, ionization structure, density, and temperature, and will provide important constraints on SN Ia progenitor and explosion models. |

|**Abstract**| The new capabilities that JWST offers in the near- and mid-infrared (IR) are used to investigate in unprecedented detail the nature of optical/near-IR faint, mid-IR bright sources, the so-called HST-dark galaxies among them. We gather JWST data from the CEERS survey in the EGS, jointly with HST data, to face this task by analyzing spatially resolved optical-to-mid-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to estimate both photometric redshifts and stellar populations properties in two dimensions. We select 138 galaxies with F150W-F356W>1.5 mag, F356W<27.5 mag, which include faint-to-dark HST galaxies (H>24 mag). The nature of these sources is threefold: (1) 71% are dusty star-forming galaxies at 2<z<6 with masses 9<log M/M_sun<11 and a variety of specific SFRs (<1 to >100 Gyr^-1); (2) 18% are quiescent/dormant (i.e., subject to reignition and rejuvenation) galaxies at 3<z<5, masses log M/M_sun~10 and post-starburst stellar mass-weighted ages (0.5-1 Gyr); and (3) 11% are strong young starbursts with indications of high-EW emission lines at 6<z<7 and log M/M_sun~9.5. Morphologically, the sample is biased towards disk-like galaxies with a remarkable compactness for XELG-z6 (effective radii smaller than 0.4 kpc). Large attenuations in SFGs, 2<A(V)<5 mag, are found within 1.5 times the effective radius, approximately 2 kpc. Our technique reproduces the expected dust emission luminosities of IR-bright and sub-millimeter galaxies. Our results imply high levels of star formation activity between z~20 and z~10, where virtually 100% of our galaxies had already formed 10^8 M_sun of their stellar content, 60% of them had assembled 10^9 M_sun, and 10% up to 10^10 M_sun (in situ or ex situ).

|**Abstract**| We conducted a Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observation of the low mass active galactic nucleus (AGN) in galaxy NGC 4293 ($z=0.003$). The object is associated with a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER). Its black hole mass is estimated as $\sim10^5$ or $\sim10^7 M_\odot$. The VLBA 1.5 GHz image shows an inverse symmetric structure with two discrete radio blobs separated by an angular distance of $\sim120$ mas, corresponding to $\sim7$ parsec. Furthermore, its integrated radio spectrum has a turnover at the frequency of $\sim0.44$ GHz. Based on the compactness and spectrum, the nuclear radio source in NGC 4293 belongs to a sample of (megahertz) peaked spectrum (PS/MPS) radio sources with compact symmetric morphologies. NGC 4293 has 1.4 GHz radio power of only $\sim10^{20}\,\mathrm{W\,Hz^{-1}}$ with the VLBA observation, which is consistent with local AGNs but lower than the current PS samples. One of the two blobs has a steep radio spectrum $\alpha=-0.62\pm0.08$ ($S_\nu\propto\nu^{+\alpha}$), while the other one has an inverted spectrum $\alpha=0.32\pm0.10$. The VLBA 1.5 GHz luminosity ratio of the two blobs is 3.23 and both blobs show lateral-flowing structures where the hotspots reside at the edge of each radio lobe. This can be explained as jet interactions with dense circumnuclear medium. We estimate the black hole mass of NGC 4293 through the fundamental plane of black hole activity, which constrains the black hole mass to be $\lesssim10^6 M_\odot$. It supports that the object is a low-mass AGN and a potential candidate for accreting and ejecting IMBHs. |

|**Abstract**| Observational searches for intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $10^2 - 10^6$ $M_\odot$) include relatively isolated dwarf galaxies. For those that host active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the IMBH nature may be discerned through the accretion - jet activity. We present radio observations of four AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies (which potentially harbor IMBHs). Very large array (VLA) observations indicate steep spectra (indices of $-$0.63 to $-$1.05) between 1.4 and 9 GHz. A comparison with the 9 GHz in-band spectral index however shows a steepening for GH047 and GH158 (implying older/relic emission) and flattening for GH106 and GH163 (implying recent activity). Overlapping emission regions in the VLA 1.4 GHz and our very long baseline array (VLBA) 1.5 GHz observations, and possibly symmetric pc-scale extensions are consistent with recent activity in the latter two. Using the compact VLBA radio luminosity, X-ray luminosity (probing the accretion activity) and the black hole masses, all AGNs are found to lie on the empirical fundamental plane relation. The four AGN are radio quiet with relatively higher Eddington ratios ($0.04 - 0.32$) and resemble the X-ray binaries during spectral state transitions that entail an outflow ejection. Furthermore, the radio to X-ray luminosity ratio $\log{R_\mathrm{X}}$ of $-3.9$ to $-5.6$ in these four sources support the scenarios including corona mass ejection from accretion disk and wind activity. The growth to kpc-scales likely proceeds along a trajectory similar to young AGNs and peaked spectrum sources. The above complex clues can thus aid in the detection and monitoring of IMBHs in the nearby Universe. |

|**Abstract**| The variability induced by precipitable water vapour (PWV) can heavily affect the accuracy of time-series photometric measurements gathered from the ground, especially in the near-infrared. We present here a novel method of modelling and mitigating this variability, as well as open-sourcing the developed tool -- Umbrella. In this study, we evaluate the extent to which the photometry in three common bandpasses (r', i', z'), and SPECULOOS' primary bandpass (I+z'), are photometrically affected by PWV variability. In this selection of bandpasses, the I+z' bandpass was found to be most sensitive to PWV variability, followed by z', i', and r'. The correction was evaluated on global light curves of nearby late M- and L-type stars observed by SPECULOOS' Southern Observatory (SSO) with the I+z' bandpass, using PWV measurements from the LHATPRO and local temperature/humidity sensors. A median reduction in RMS of 1.1% was observed for variability shorter than the expected transit duration for SSO's targets. On timescales longer than the expected transit duration, where long-term variability may be induced, a median reduction in RMS of 53.8% was observed for the same method of correction. |

|**Abstract**| Particles of various sizes can exist around Mars. The orbits of large particles are mainly governed by Martian gravity, while those of small particles could be significantly affected by non-gravitational forces. Many of the previous studies of particle dynamics around Mars have focused on relatively small particles (radius of $r_{\rm p} \lesssim 100 \, \mu m$) for $\lesssim 10^{4}$ years. In this paper, using direct numerical orbital integration and analytical approaches, we consider Martian gravity, Martian $J_{2}$, the solar radiation pressure (SRP) and the Poynting-Robertson (PR) force to study the giga-year dynamical evolution of particles orbiting near the Martian equatorial plane with radius ranging from micrometer to meter. We also newly study the effect of the planetary shadow upon the particle dynamics. Our results show that small particles ($r_{\rm p} \lesssim 10 \, \mu m$) initially at $\lesssim 8$ Martian radii (below the orbit of today's Deimos) are quickly removed by the SRP due to eccentricity increase, resulting in a collision with Mars at the pericenter distnace. The orbits of larger particles ($r_{\rm p} > 10 \, \mu m$) slowly decay due to the PR forces (timescale of $> 10^{4}$ years). The planetary shadow reduces the sunlit area in the orbit and thus the efficiency of the PR drag force is reduced. However, we show that, even including the planetary shadow, particles up to $\sim 10$ cm in radius, initially at $\lesssim 8$ Martian radii, eventually spiral onto the Martian surface within $\sim 10^{9}$ years. Smaller particles require less time to reach Mars, and vice versa. Our results would be important to better understand and constrain the nature of the remaining particle around Mars in a context of giant impact hypothesis for the formation of Phobos and Deimos. |

|**Abstract**| We first present the multicolor photometry results of the rapidly rotating magnetic star HD 345439 using the Nanshan One-meter Wide-field Telescope. From the photometric observations, we derive a rotational period of 0.7699\pm0.0014 day. The light curves of HD 345439 are dominated by the double asymmetric S-wave feature that arises from the magnetic clouds. Pulsating behaviors are not observed in Sector 41 of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. No evidence is found of the occurrence of centrifugal breakout events neither in the residual flux nor in the systematic variations at the extremum of the light curve. Based on the hypothesis of the Rigidly Rotating Magnetosphere model, we restrict the magnetic obliquity angle {$\beta$} and the rotational inclination angle $i$ so that they satisfy the approximate relation {$\beta + i \approx 105^{\circ}$}. The colour excess, extinction, and luminosity are determined to be $E_{(B-V)}=0.745\pm0.016\,$mag, $A_{V}=2.31\pm0.05\,$mag, and $\rm log\,(L/L_{\odot})=3.82\pm0.1 $dex, respectively. Furthermore, we derive the effective temperature as $T$$\rm _{eff}=22\pm1 $kK and the surface gravity as log$g=4.00\pm0.22$. The mass$ M=7.24_{-1.24}^{+1.75}\rm M_{\odot}$, radius$ R=4.44_{-1.93}^{+2.68}\rm R_{\odot}$, and age$\rm \tau_{age}=23.62\,_{-21.97}^{+4.24} $Myr are estimated from the Hertzsprung--Russell Diagram |

|**Abstract**| The spectra of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars exhibit strong, broad emission lines that originate in the wind. These winds are radiatively driven and are susceptible to hydrodynamic instabilities that result in the formation of clumps. When modelling spectra of WR stars the volume-filling factor (VFF) approach is usually employed to treat clumpy winds. However, it is based on the assumption that the entire wind mass resides in optically thin clumps, which is not necessarily justifiable in dense winds. To test the validity of the VFF approach we use a previously described method of treating clumping, the ``Shell'' approach, to study line and continuum formation in the dense wind of the WN4 star, HD 50896. Our models indicate that fully intact spherical shells are in tension with observed spectra; a persistent ``dip'' in emission lines occurs at line centre. Removing this dip requires our models to use ``broken'' shells -- shells that are highly decoherent laterally. This insinuates that the wind of HD 50896, and by extension the winds of other WR stars, are comprised of small laterally confined and radially compressed clumps -- clumps smaller than the Sobolev length. We discuss some of the conditions necessary for the VFF approach to be valid. |

|**Abstract**| The Earth occultation technique has broad applications in both astronomy and atmospheric density measurements. We construct the background model during the occultation of the Crab Nebula observed by the Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) at energies between 6 keV and 100 keV. We propose a Bayesian atmospheric density retrieval method based on the Earth occultation technique, combining Poisson and Gaussian statistics. By modeling the atmospheric attenuation of X-ray photons during the occultation, we simultaneously retrieved the neutral densities of the atmosphere at different altitude ranges. Our method considers the correlation of densities between neighboring atmospheric layers and reduces the potential systematic bias to which previous work may be subject. Previous analyses based on light curve fitting or spectral fitting also lost some spectral or temporal information of the data. In contrast to previous work, the occultation data observed by the three telescopes onboard Insight-HXMT is fully used in our analysis, further reducing the statistical error in density retrieval. We apply our method to cross-check the (semi-)empirical atmospheric models, using 115 sets of occultation data of the Crab Nebula observed by Insight-HXMT. We find that the retrieved neutral density is ~10%, ~20%, and ~25% less than the values of the widely used atmospheric model NRLMSISE-00, in the altitude range of 55--80 km, 80--90 km, and 90--100 km, respectively. We also show that the newly released atmospheric model NRLMSIS 2.0 is generally consistent with our density measurements. |

|**Abstract**| We study the evolution of kinematically-defined stellar discs in 10 Fornax-like clusters identified in the TNG50 run from the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological simulations. We considered disc galaxies with present-day stellar mass $M_{\star}\geq 3 \times 10^{8} M_{\odot}$ and follow their evolution since first entering their host cluster. Very few stellar discs survive since falling in such dense environments, ranging from 40% surviving to all being disrupted. Such survival rates are consistent with what reported earlier for the two more massive, Virgo-like clusters in TNG50. In absolute terms, however, the low number of present-day disc galaxies in Fornax-like clusters could be at odds with the presence of three edge-on disc galaxies in the central regions of the actual Fornax cluster, as delineated by the Fornax3D survey. When looking at the Fornax analogues from random directions and with the same selection function of Fornax3D, the probability of finding three edge-on disc galaxies in any one Fornax-like cluster in TNG50 is rather low, albeit not impossible. We also compared the stellar-population properties near the equatorial plane derived from integral-field spectroscopy for the three edge-ons in Fornax to similar line-of-sight integrated values for present-day disc galaxies in TNG50. For one of these, the very old and metal-rich stellar population of its disc cannot be matched by any the disc galaxies in TNG50, including objects in the field. We discuss possible interpretations of these findings, while pointing to future studies on passive cluster spirals as a way to further test state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. |

|**Abstract**| We propose a general framework leveraging the halo-galaxy connection to link galaxies observed at different redshift in a statistical way, and use the link to infer the redshift evolution of the galaxy population. Our tests based on hydrodynamic simulations show that our method can accurately recover the stellar mass assembly histories up to $z\sim 3$ for present star-forming and quiescent galaxies down to $10^{10}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. Applying the method to observational data shows that the stellar mass evolution of the main progenitors of galaxies depends strongly on the properties of descendants, such as stellar mass, halo mass, and star formation states. Galaxies hosted by low-mass groups/halos at the present time have since $z\sim 1.8$ grown their stellar mass $\sim 2.5$ times as fast as those hosted by massive clusters. This dependence on host halo mass becomes much weaker for descendant galaxies with similar star formation states. Star-forming galaxies grow about 2-4 times faster than their quiescent counterparts since $z\sim 1.8$. Both TNG and EAGLE simulations over-predict the progenitor stellar mass at $z>1$, particularly for low-mass descendants. |

|**Abstract**| We analyze stellar streams in action-angle coordinates combined with recent local direct acceleration measurements to provide joint constraints on the potential of our Galaxy. Our stream analysis uses the Kullback-Leibler divergence with a likelihood analysis based on the two-point correlation function. We provide joint constraints from pulsar accelerations and stellar streams for local and global parameters that describe the potential of the Milky Way (MW). Our goal is to build an ``acceleration ladder", where direct acceleration measurements that are currently limited in dynamic range are combined with indirect techniques that can access a much larger volume of the MW. To constrain the MW potential with stellar streams, we consider the Palomar 5, Orphan, Nyx, Helmi and GD1 streams. Of the potential models that we have considered here, the preferred potential for the streams is a two-component Staeckel potential. We also compare the vertical accelerations from stellar streams and pulsar timing, defining a function $f(z) = \alpha_{1pulsar}z - \frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial z}$, where $\Phi$ is the MW potential determined from stellar streams, and $\alpha_{1~\rm pulsar}z$ is the vertical acceleration determined from pulsar timing observations. Our analysis indicates that the Oort limit determined from streams is consistently (regardless of the choice of potential) lower than that determined from pulsar timing observations. The calibration we have derived here may be used to correct the estimate of the acceleration from stellar streams. |

|**Abstract**| We present ALMA dust polarization and molecular line observations toward 4 clumps (I(N), I, IV, and V) in the massive star-forming region NGC 6334. In conjunction with large-scale dust polarization and molecular line data from JCMT, Planck, and NANTEN2, we make a synergistic analysis of relative orientations between magnetic fields ($\theta_{\mathrm{B}}$), column density gradients ($\theta_{\mathrm{NG}}$), local gravity ($\theta_{\mathrm{LG}}$), and velocity gradients ($\theta_{\mathrm{VG}}$) to investigate the multi-scale (from $\sim$30 pc to 0.003 pc) physical properties in NGC 6334. We find that the relative orientation between $\theta_{\mathrm{B}}$ and $\theta_{\mathrm{NG}}$ changes from statistically more perpendicular to parallel as column density ($N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$) increases, which is a signature of trans-to-sub-Alfv\'{e}nic turbulence at complex/cloud scales as revealed by previous numerical studies. Because $\theta_{\mathrm{NG}}$ and $\theta_{\mathrm{LG}}$ are preferentially aligned within the NGC 6334 cloud, we suggest that the more parallel alignment between $\theta_{\mathrm{B}}$ and $\theta_{\mathrm{NG}}$ at higher $N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$ is because the magnetic field line is dragged by gravity. At even higher $N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$, the angle between $\theta_{\mathrm{B}}$ and $\theta_{\mathrm{NG}}$ or $\theta_{\mathrm{LG}}$ transits back to having no preferred orientation or statistically slightly more perpendicular, suggesting that the magnetic field structure is impacted by star formation activities. A statistically more perpendicular alignment is found between $\theta_{\mathrm{B}}$ and $\theta_{\mathrm{VG}}$ throughout our studied $N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$ range, which indicates a trans-to-sub-Alfv\'{e}nic state at small scales as well. The normalised mass-to-flux ratio derived from the polarization-intensity gradient (KTH) method increases with $N_{\mathrm{H_2}}$. |

|**Abstract**| The Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF) is an enigmatic sedimentary unit near the equator of Mars, with an uncertain formation process and absolute age. Due to the heavily wind-eroded surface, it is difficult to determine the absolute model age of the MFF using a one-parameter model based on the crater size-frequency distribution function with existing crater count data. We create a new two-parameter model that estimates both age and a constant erosion rate ($\beta$) by treating cratering as a random Poisson process. Our study uses new crater count data collected from Context Camera imagery for both the MFF and other young equatorial sedimentary rock. Based on our new model, the Central MFF formed $>$1.5 Gyr ago and had low erosion rates ($<$650 nm yr$^{-1}$), whereas the East MFF, Far East MFF, and Zephyria Planum most likely formed $<$1.5 Gyr ago and had higher erosion rates ($>$740 nm $^{-1}$). The top of Aeolis Mons (informally known as Mount Sharp) in Gale Crater and Eastern Candor have relatively young ages and low erosion rates. Based on the estimated erosion rates (since fast erosion permits metastable shallow ice), we also identify several sites, including Zephyria Planum, as plausible locations for shallow subsurface equatorial water ice that is detectable by gamma-ray spectroscopy or neutron spectroscopy. In addition to confirming $<$1.5 Gyr sedimentary rock formations on Mars, and distinguishing older and younger MFF sites, we find that fast-eroding locations have younger ages and MFF locations with slower erosion have older best-fit ages. |
