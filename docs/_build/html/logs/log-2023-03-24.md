|**Abstract**| Aims: The JWST program JOYS (JWST Observations of Young protoStars) aims at characterizing the physical and chemical properties of young high- and low-mass star-forming regions, in particular the unique mid-infrared diagnostics of the warmer gas and solid-state components. We present early results from the high-mass star formation region IRAS23385+6053. Methods: The JOYS program uses the MIRI MRS with its IFU to investigate a sample of high- and low-mass star-forming protostellar systems. Results: The 5 to 28mum MIRI spectrum of IRAS23385+6053 shows a plethora of features. While the general spectrum is typical for an embedded protostar, we see many atomic and molecular gas lines boosted by the higher spectral resolution and sensitivity compared to previous space missions. Furthermore, ice and dust absorption features are also present. Here, we focus on the continuum emission, outflow tracers like the H2, [FeII] and [NeII] lines as well as the potential accretion tracer Humphreys alpha HI(7--6). The short-wavelength MIRI data resolve two continuum sources A and B, where mid-infrared source A is associated with the main mm continuum peak. The combination of mid-infrared and mm data reveals a young cluster in its making. Combining the mid-infrared outflow tracer H2, [FeII] and [NeII] with mm SiO data shows a complex interplay of at least three molecular outflows driven by protostars in the forming cluster. Furthermore, the Humphreys alpha line is detected at a 3-4sigma level towards the mid-infrared sources A and B. Following Rigliaco et al. (2015), one can roughly estimate accretion luminosities and corresponding accretion rates between ~2.6x10^-6 and ~0.9x10^-4 M_sun/yr. This is discussed in the context of the observed outflow rates. Conclusions: The analysis of the MIRI MRS observations for this young high-mass star-forming region reveals connected outflow and accretion signatures. |

|**Abstract**| The Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) provides one of the four operating modes of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The MRS is an integral field spectrometer, measuring the spatial and spectral distributions of light across the 5-28 $\mu m$ wavelength range with a spectral resolving power between 3700-1300. We present the MRS' optical, spectral, and spectro-photometric performance, as achieved in flight, and report on the effects that limit the instrument's ultimate sensitivity. The MRS flight performance has been quantified using observations of stars, planetary nebulae, and planets in our Solar System. The precision and accuracy of this calibration is checked against celestial calibrators with well known flux levels and spectral features. We find that the MRS geometric calibration has a distortion solution accuracy relative to the commanded position of 8 mas at 5 $\mu m$ and 23 mas at 28 $\mu m$. The wavelength calibration is accurate to within 9 km/sec at 5 $\mu m$ and 27 km/sec at 28 $\mu m$. The uncertainty in the absolute spectro-photometric calibration accuracy is estimated at 5.6 +- 0.7 %. The MIRI calibration pipeline is able to suppress the amplitude of spectral fringes to below 1.5 % for both extended and point sources across the entire wavelength range. The MRS PSF is 60 % broader than the diffraction limit along its long axis at 5 $\mu m$ and is 15 % broader at 28 $\mu m$. The MRS flight performance is found to be better than pre-launch expectations. The MRS is one of the most subscribed observing modes of JWST and is yielding many high-profile publications. It is currently humanity's most powerful instrument for measuring the mid-infrared spectra of celestial sources and is expected to continue as such for many years to come. |

|**Abstract**| Transiting planets provide unique opportunities for the atmospheric characterization of exoplanets as they can reveal composition and the temperature structures at the day-night terminator regions in planetary atmospheres, and help understand the atmospheric process and formation environments of exoplanets. Here, we present the optical transmission spectroscopic study of an inflated Saturn-mass planet WASP-69 b, obtained by the 4-meter ground-based telescope Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR). We obtain spectroscopic transit light curves in 20 passbands from 502 to 890 nm, and fit them using Gaussian Processes and an analytical transit model to obtain independent transit depths for each. The derived transmission spectrum of WASP-69 b shows a slope with absorption depth increasing towards blue wavelengths, indicating a Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere consistent with previous works. The retrieval analysis yields a tentative detection of TiO absorption feature in the transmission spectrum. We present the first results from the SOAR telescope to characterize exoplanetary atmospheres proving its capability and precision for hot Jupiters around bright stars in an area dominated by results from large ground-based telescopes or space telescopes. |

|**Abstract**| We combine photometry of Eris from a 6-month campaign on the Palomar 60-inch telescope in 2015, a 1-month Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 campaign in 2018, and Dark Energy Survey data spanning 2013--2018 to determine a light curve of definitive period $15.771\pm 0.008$~days (1-$\sigma$ formal uncertainties), with nearly sinusoidal shape and peak-to-peak flux variation of 3\%. This is consistent at part-per-thousand precision with the $P=15.78590\pm0.00005$~day period of Dysnomia's orbit around Eris, strengthening the recent detection of synchronous rotation of Eris by Szakats et al (2022) with independent data. Photometry from Gaia is consistent with the same light curve. We detect a slope of $0.05\pm0.01$~mag per degree of Eris' brightness with respect to illumination phase, intermediate between Pluto's and Charon's values. Variations of $0.3$~mag are detected in Dysnomia's brightness, plausibly consistent with a double-peaked light curve at the synchronous period. The synchronous rotation of Eris is consistent with simple tidal models initiated with a giant-impact origin of the binary, but is difficult to reconcile with gravitational capture of Dysnomia by Eris. |
