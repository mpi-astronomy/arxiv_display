|**Abstract**| We use CEERS JWST/NIRCam imaging to measure rest-frame near-IR light profiles of $>$500 $M_\star>10^{10}~M_\odot$ galaxies in the redshift range $0.5<z<2.3$. We compare the resulting rest-frame 1.5-2$\mu$m half-light radii ($R_{\rm{NIR}}$) with stellar half-mass radii (\rmass) derived with multi-color light profiles from CANDELS HST imaging. In general agreement with previous work, we find that $R_{\rm{NIR}}$ and \rmass~are up to 40\%~smaller than the rest-frame optical half-light radius $R_{\rm{opt}}$. The agreement between $R_{\rm{NIR}}$ and \rmass~is excellent, with negligible systematic offset ($<$0.03 dex) up to $z=2$ for quiescent galaxies and up to $z=1.5$ for star-forming galaxies. We also deproject the profiles to estimate \rmassd, the radius of a sphere containing 50\% of the stellar mass. We present the $R-M_\star$ distribution of galaxies at $0.5<z<1.5$, comparing $R_{\rm{opt}}$, \rmass~and \rmassd. The slope is significantly flatter for \rmass~and \rmassd~ compared to $R_{\rm{opt}}$, mostly due to downward shifts in size for massive star-forming galaxies, while \rmass~and \rmassd~do not show markedly different trends. Finally, we show rapid size evolution ($R\propto (1+z)^{-1.7\pm0.1}$) for massive ($M_\star>10^{11}~M_\odot$) quiescent galaxies between $z=0.5$ and $z=2.3$, again comparing $R_{\rm{opt}}$, \rmass~and \rmassd. We conclude that the main tenets of the size evolution narrative established over the past 20 years, based on rest-frame optical light profile analysis, still hold in the era of JWST/NIRCam observations in the rest-frame near-IR. |

|**Abstract**| Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) play an important role in our understanding of supernovae and their feedback on the interstellar environment. SNR G352.7$-$0.1 is special for its thermal composite morphology and double-ring structure. We have performed spectroscopic mapping in $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO $J=2$-1 lines toward G352.7$-$0.1 with the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment telescope. Broad $^{12}$CO lines are found in the northeastern ring at a local-standard-of-rest velocity range of $\sim-50$-$-30$ km s$^{-1}$, suggesting that the remnant is interacting with molecular clouds (MCs) at $\sim-51$ km s$^{-1}$. Thus, we adopt a distance of $\sim10.5$ kpc for this SNR. The momentum and kinetic energy of the shocked gas along the line of sight are estimated to be $\sim10^2{\rm M_{sun}}$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\sim10^{46}$ erg, respectively. We also find an expanding structure around the remnant, which is possibly related to the wind-blown bubble of the progenitor star. From the Fermi-LAT data in an energy range of 0.1-500 GeV, we find no gamma-ray counterparts of G352.7$-$0.1. |
