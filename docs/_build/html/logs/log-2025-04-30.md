|**Abstract**|            Sub-Neptunes, the most common planet type, remain poorly understood. Their atmospheres are expected to be diverse, but their compositions are challenging to determine, even with JWST. Here, we present the first JWST spectroscopic study of the warm sub-Neptune GJ3090b (2.13R$_\oplus$, Teq~700 K) which orbits an M2V star, making it a favourable target for atmosphere characterization. We observed four transits of GJ3090b; two each using JWST NIRISS/SOSS and NIRSpec/G395H, yielding wavelength coverage from 0.6-5.2 $\mu$m. We detect the signature of the 10833 Ã… metastable Helium triplet at a statistical significance of 5.5$\sigma$ with an amplitude of 434$\pm$79 ppm, marking the first such detection in a sub-Neptune with JWST. This amplitude is significantly smaller than predicted by solar-metallicity forward models, suggesting a metal-enriched atmosphere which decreases the mass-loss rate and attenuates the Helium feature amplitude. Moreover, we find that stellar contamination, in the form of the transit light source effect, dominates the NIRISS transmission spectra, with unocculted spot and faculae properties varying across the two visits separated in time by approximately six months. Free retrieval analyses on the NIRSpec/G395H spectrum find tentative evidence for highly muted features and a lack of CH4. These findings are best explained by a high metallicity atmosphere (>100x solar at 3$\sigma$ confidence, for clouds at $\sim \mu$bar pressures) using chemically-consistent retrievals and self-consistent model grids. Further observations of GJ3090b are needed for tighter constraints on the atmospheric abundances, and to gain a deeper understanding of the processes that led to its potential metal enrichment.         |

|**Abstract**|            Exoplanets classified as super-Earths are commonly observed on short period orbits, close to their host stars, but their abundance on wider orbits is poorly constrained. Gravitational microlensing is sensitive to exoplanets on wide orbits. We observed the microlensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-0007, which indicates an exoplanet with a planet-to-star mass ratio roughly double the Earth-Sun mass-ratio, on an orbit longer than Saturn's. We combine this event with a larger sample from a microlensing survey to determine the distribution of mass ratios for planets on wide orbits. We infer there are $\sim 0.35$ super-Earth planets per star on Jupiter-like orbits. The observations are most consistent with a bimodal distribution, with separate peaks for super-Earths and gas giants. We suggest that this reflects differences in their formation processes.         |

|**Abstract**|            Time-domain surveys have advanced astronomical research by revealing diverse variable phenomena, from stellar flares to transient events. The scale and complexity of survey data, along with the demand for rapid classification, present significant challenges for analysis. While machine learning offers solutions, most existing models are tailored to single tasks, struggle to generalize, and depend heavily on large, accurately labeled datasets. We introduce FALCO, a foundation model for astronomical light curve analysis in time-domain astronomy. This work presents the initial version of FALCO trained via self-supervised learning on unlabeled Kepler light curves using a Transformer-based architecture. The model has been evaluated on three distinct tasks and demonstrates strong generalization: achieving 95 percent accuracy in stellar variability classification across eight classes, an overall RMSE of 0.1305 dex in surface gravity estimation (notably improved to below 0.08 dex when log g is less than 1, and approximately 0.02 dex near log g equals 3), and 87 percent precision in flare identification. These results highlight the model's versatility and ability to learn generalizable representations from light curves, enabling straightforward adaptation to diverse tasks. We further analyze the impact of model scaling and sequence length, finding performance improves with larger models and longer input sequences. We also apply FALCO to derive surface gravity (log g) measurements for 179,732 Kepler stars from their light curves.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report the discovery of a progenitor candidate for the Type IIb SN 2024abfo using multi-epoch pre-explosion images from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. The progenitor exhibited a ~0.7 mag decline in F814W from 2001 to 2013, followed by significant brightness and color fluctuations in the g, r and z bands. This is the first time that a variable progenitor has been found for a SN IIb. We suggest that the variability is caused by intrinsic changes in the progenitor star instead of varying obscuration by circumstellar dust. Our results show that the progenitor of SN 2024abfo was likely a yellow supergiant star with an initial mass of 12--14, 14--15 and 15--18 Msun for different assumed values of circumstellar reddening of E(B-V)_CSM = 0, 0.1 and 0.2 mag. Our study underscores the critical role of multi-epoch imaging surveys in revealing the final stages of core-collapse supernovae progenitors.         |
