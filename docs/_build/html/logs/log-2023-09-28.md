|**Abstract**| Aims: We leverage the largest available Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) survey from the archive (A$^3$COSMOS) to study to study infrared luminosity function and dust-obscured star formation rate density of sub-millimeter/millimeter (sub-mm/mm) galaxies from $z=0.5\,-\,6$. Methods: The A$^3$COSMOS survey utilizes all publicly available ALMA data in the COSMOS field, therefore having inhomogeneous coverage in terms of observing wavelength and depth. In order to derive the luminosity functions and star formation rate densities, we apply a newly developed method that corrects the statistics of an inhomogeously sampled survey of individual pointings to those representing an unbiased blind survey. Results: We find our sample to mostly consist of massive ($M_{\star} \sim 10^{10} - 10^{12}$ $\rm M_{\odot}$), IR-bright ($L_* \sim 10^{11}-10^{13.5} \rm L_{\odot}$), highly star-forming (SFR $\sim 100-1000$ $\rm M_{\odot}$ $\rm yr^{-1}$) galaxies. We find an evolutionary trend in the typical density ($\Phi^*$) and luminosity ($L^*$) of the galaxy population, which decrease and increase with redshift, respectively. Our IR LF is in agreement with previous literature results and we are able to extend to high redshift ($z > 3$) the constraints on the knee and bright-end of the LF, derived by using the Herschel data. Finally, we obtain the SFRD up to $z\sim 6$ by integrating the IR LF, finding a broad peak from $z \sim 1$ to $z \sim 3$ and a decline towards higher redshifts, in agreement with recent IR/mm-based studies, within the uncertainties, thus implying the presence of larger quantities of dust than what is expected by optical/UV studies. |

|**Abstract**| Context: Circumstellar debris disks provide insight into the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. Resolved belts in particular help to locate planetesimals in exosystems, and can hint at the presence of disk-sculpting exoplanets. Aims: We study the circumstellar environment of HD 112810 (HIP 63439), a mid-F type star in the Sco-Cen association with a significant infrared excess indicating the presence of a circumstellar debris disk. Methods: We collected five high-contrast observations of HD 112810 with VLT/SPHERE. We identified a debris disk in scattered light, and found that the debris signature is robust over a number of epochs and a variety of reduction techniques. We modelled the disk, accounting for self-subtraction and assuming that it is optically thin. Results: We find a single-belt debris disk, with a radius of 118$\pm$9au and an inclination angle of ${75.7}^{+1.1}_{-1.3}$$\deg$. This is in good agreement with the constraints from SED modelling and from a partially-resolved ALMA image of the system. No planets are detected, though planets below the detection limit ($\sim$2.6M$_\textrm{J}$ at a projected separation of 118au) could be present and could have contributed to sculpting the ring of debris. Conclusions: HD 112810 adds to the growing inventory of debris disks imaged in scattered light. The disk is faint, but the radius and the inclination of the disk are promising for follow-up studies of the dust properties. |

|| P. Rinaldi, et al. -- incl., <mark>F. Walter</mark>, <mark>L. Boogaard</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-09-28*|

|**Abstract**| We make use of the deepest JWST/MIRI image at 5.6 um, obtained in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF), to constrain the role of strong Ha emitters (HAEs) in Cosmic Reionization at z~7-8. Our sample of bright (M(UV) < -20 mag) HAEs is comprised of young (<30 Myr) galaxies with low stellar masses (<= 10^9 Msun). They span a wide range of UV-beta slopes, with a median beta = -2.22+-0.35, which broadly correlates with stellar mass. We estimate the ionizing photon production efficiency (xi_ion,0) of these sources (assuming f_esc,LyC = 0), which yields a median value log10(xi_ion,0/(Hz erg^(-1))) = 25.54(+0.09, -0.10). We show that xi_ion,0 positively correlates with EW0(Ha) and specific star formation rate (sSFR). Instead xi_ion,0 weakly anti-correlates with stellar mass and beta. Based on the beta values, we estimate f_esc,LyC=0.07(+0.03, -0.02), which results in log10(xi_ion/(Hz erg^(-1))) = 25.59 (+0.06, -0.04). By considering this result along with others from the literature, we find a mild evolution of xi_ion with redshift. Finally, we assess the impact of strong HAEs during Cosmic Reionization at z~7-8. We find that our HAEs do not need high values of f_esc, rel (only 6-10%) to be able to reionize their surrounding intergalactic medium. They have N_dot_ion = 10^(50.43+-0.3) s^(-1)Mpc^(-3) and contribute more than a factor of two in terms of emitted ionizing photons per comoving volume compared to non-Ha emitters in the same redshift bin, suggesting that strong, young, and low stellar-mass emitters could have played a central role during the Epoch of Reionization. |

|| S. Shahaf, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. El-Badry</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-09-28*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted to MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**| The third data release of Gaia was the first to include orbital solutions assuming non-single stars. Here, we apply the astrometric triage technique of Shahaf et al. 2019 to identify binary star systems with companions that are not single main-sequence stars. Gaia's synthetic photometry of these binaries is used to distinguish between systems likely to have white-dwarf companions and those that may be hierarchical triples. The study uncovered a population of nearly 3200 binaries, characterised by orbital separations on the order of an astronomical unit, in which the faint astrometric companion is probably a white dwarf. Remarkably, over 110 of these systems exhibit significant ultraviolet excess flux, confirming this classification and, in some cases, indicating their relatively young cooling ages. We show that the sample is not easily reproduced by binary population synthesis codes. Therefore, it challenges current binary evolution models, offering a unique opportunity to gain insights into the processes governing white-dwarf formation, binary evolution, and mass transfer. |

|| N. S. Abrams, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-09-28*|
|*Comments*| *21 pages, 15 figures, submitted to ApJS Rubin Survey Strategy Edition*|
|**Abstract**| The Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time will discover thousands of microlensing events across the Milky Way Galaxy, allowing for the study of populations of exoplanets, stars, and compact objects. It will reach deeper limiting magnitudes over a wider area than any previous survey. We evaluate numerous survey strategies simulated in the Rubin Operation Simulations (OpSims) to assess the discovery and characterization efficiencies of microlensing events. We have implemented three metrics in the Rubin Metric Analysis Framework: a discovery metric and two characterization metrics, where one estimates how well the lightcurve is covered and the other quantifies how precisely event parameters can be determined. We also assess the characterizability of microlensing parallax, critical for detection of free-floating black hole lenses, in a representative bulge and disk field. We find that, given Rubin's baseline cadence, the discovery and characterization efficiency will be higher for longer duration and larger parallax events. Microlensing discovery efficiency is dominated by observing footprint, where more time spent looking at regions of high stellar density including the Galactic bulge, Galactic plane, and Magellanic clouds, leads to higher discovery and characterization rates. However, if the observations are stretched over too wide an area, including low-priority areas of the Galactic plane with fewer stars and higher extinction, event characterization suffers by > 10%, which could impact exoplanet, binary star, and compact object events alike. We find that some rolling strategies (where Rubin focuses on a fraction of the sky in alternating years) in the Galactic bulge can lead to a 15-20% decrease in microlensing parallax characterization, so rolling strategies should be chosen carefully to minimize losses. |
