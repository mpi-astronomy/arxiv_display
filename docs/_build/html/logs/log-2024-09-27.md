|**Abstract**|            Growing evidence suggests that protoplanetary discs may be influenced by late stage infall from the interstellar medium (ISM). It remains unclear the degree to which infall shapes disc populations at ages $\gtrsim 1$~Myr. We explore possible spatial correlations between stellar accretion rates in the Lupus star forming region, which would support the hypothesis that infall can regulate stellar accretion. We consider both the `clustered' stars towards the center of Lupus 3, and the `distributed' stars that are more sparsely distributed across the Lupus complex. We take the observed accretion rates in the literature and explore spatial correlations. In particular, we test whether the clustered stars exhibit a radial gradient in normalised accretion rates, and whether the distributed stars have spatially correlated accretion rates. We find statistically significant correlations for both the clustered and distributed samples. The clustered sample exhibits higher accretion rates in the central region, consistent with the expected Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate. Stars that are spatially closer among the distributed population also exhibit more similar accretion rates. These results cannot be explained by the stellar mass distribution for either sample. Age gradients are disfavoured, though not discounted, because normalised disc dust masses are not spatially correlated across the region. Spatially correlated stellar accretion rates within the Lupus star forming region argue in favour of an environmental influence on stellar accretion, possibly combined with internal processes in the inner disc. Refined age measurements and searches for evidence of infalling material is a potential way to further test this finding.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Neptunian desert and savanna have been recently found to be separated by a ridge, an overdensity of planets in the $\simeq$3-5 days period range. These features are thought to be shaped by dynamical and atmospheric processes. However, their relative roles are not yet well understood. We intend to confirm and characterise the super-Neptune TESS candidate TOI-5005.01, which orbits a moderately bright (V = 11.8) solar-type star (G2 V) with an orbital period of 6.3 days. We confirm TOI-5005 b to be a transiting super-Neptune with a radius of $R_{\rm p}$ = $6.25\pm 0.24$ $\rm R_{\rm \oplus}$ ($R_{\rm p}$ = $0.558\pm 0.021$ $\rm R_{\rm J}$) and a mass of $M_{\rm p}$ = $32.7\pm 5.9$ $\rm M_{\oplus}$ ($M_{\rm p}$ = $0.103\pm 0.018$ $\rm M_{\rm J}$), which corresponds to a mean density of $\rho_{\rm p}$ = $0.74 \pm 0.16$ $\rm g \, cm^{-3}$. Our internal structure modelling indicates that the overall metal mass fraction is well constrained to a value slightly lower than that of Neptune and Uranus ($Z_{\rm planet}$ = $0.76^{+0.04}_{-0.11}$). We also estimated the present-day atmospheric mass-loss rate of TOI-5005 b but found contrasting predictions depending on the choice of photoevaporation model. At a population level, we find statistical evidence ($p$-value = $0.0092^{+0.0184}_{-0.0066}$) that planets in the savanna such as TOI-5005 b tend to show lower densities than planets in the ridge, with a dividing line around 1 $\rm g \, cm^{-3}$, which supports the hypothesis of different evolutionary pathways populating both regimes. TOI-5005 b is located in a key region of the period-radius space to study the transition between the Neptunian ridge and the savanna. It orbits the brightest star of all such planets, which makes it a target of interest for atmospheric and orbital architecture observations that will bring a clearer picture of its overall evolution.         |
