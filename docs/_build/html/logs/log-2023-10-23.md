|**Abstract**| We try to understand the trends in the mass density slopes as a function of galaxy properties. We use the results from the best Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) of the integral-field stellar kinematics for near 6000 galaxies from the MaNGA DynPop project, with stellar masses of $10^{9-12}\ {\rm M_{\odot}}$, including both early-type and late-type galaxies. We use the mass-weighted density slopes for the stellar $\overline{\gamma}_*$, dark $\overline{\gamma}_{\rm DM}$, and total $\overline{\gamma}_{\rm T}$ mass from Zhu et al. (2023b). The $\overline{\gamma}_{\rm T}$ approaches a constant value of 2.2 for high $\sigma_{\rm e}$ galaxies, and flattens for lg$(\sigma_{\rm e}/{\rm km\ s^{-1}})\lesssim2.3$, reaching 1.5 for lg$(\sigma_{\rm e}/{\rm km\ s^{-1}})\approx1.8$. The total and stellar slopes track each other tightly, with $\overline{\gamma}_{\rm T}\approx\overline{\gamma}_*-0.174$ over the full $\sigma_{\rm e}$ range. This confirms the dominance of stellar matter within $R_{\rm e}$. We also show that there is no perfect conspiracy between baryonic and dark matter, as $\overline{\gamma}_*$ and $\overline{\gamma}_{\rm DM}$ do not vary inversely within the $\sigma_{\rm e}$ range. We find that the central galaxies from TNG50 and TNG100 simulations do not reproduce the observed galaxy mass distribution, which we attribute to the overestimated dark matter fraction, possibly due to a constant IMF and excessive adiabatic contraction effects in the simulations. Finally, we present the stacked dark matter density profiles and show that they are slightly steeper than the pure dark matter simulation prediction of $\overline{\gamma}_{\rm DM}\approx1$, suggesting moderate adiabatic contraction in the central region of galaxies. Our work demonstrate the power of stellar dynamics modelling for probing the interaction between stellar and dark matter and testing galaxy formation theories. |

|**Abstract**| Studying stars that are located off the Galactic plane is important for understanding the formation history of the Milky Way. We searched for SiO masers toward off-plane O-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars from the catalog presented by Mauron et al. (2019) in order to shed light on the origin of these objects. A total of 102 stars were observed in the SiO $J$=1-0, $v=1$ and 2 transitions with the Effelsberg-100 m and Tianma-65 m telescopes. SiO masers were discovered in eight stars, all first detections. The measured maser velocities allow the first estimates of the host AGB stars' radial velocities. We find that the radial velocities of three stars (namely G068.881-24.615, G070.384-24.886, and G084.453-21.863) significantly deviate from the values expected from Galactic circular motion. The updated distances and 3D motions indicate that G068.881$-$24.615 is likely located in the Galactic halo, while G160.648-08.846 is probably located in the Galactic thin disk, and the other six stars are probably part of the Galactic thick disk. |

|**Abstract**| We illustrate the formation and evolution of the Milky Way over cosmic time, utilizing a sample of 10 million red giant stars with full chemodynamical information, including metallicities and $\alpha$-abundances from low-resolution Gaia XP spectra. The evolution of angular momentum as a function of metallicity - a rough proxy for stellar age, particularly for high-[$\alpha$/Fe] stars - displays three distinct phases: the disordered and chaotic protogalaxy, the kinematically-hot old disk, and the kinematically-cold young disk. The old high-$\alpha$ disk starts at [Fe/H] $\approx -1.0$, 'spinning up' from the nascent protogalaxy, and then exhibits a smooth 'cooldown' toward more ordered and circular orbits at higher metallicities. The young low-$\alpha$ disk is kinematically cold throughout its metallicity range, with its observed properties modulated by a strong radial gradient. We interpret these trends using Milky Way analogs from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, identifying one that closely matches the kinematic evolution of our Galaxy. This halo's protogalaxy spins up into a relatively thin and misaligned high-$\alpha$ disk at early times, which is subsequently heated and torqued by a major gas-rich merger. The merger contributes a large amount of low-metallicity gas and angular momentum, from which the kinematically cold low-$\alpha$ stellar disk is subsequently born. This simulated history parallels several observed features of the Milky Way, particularly the decisive 'GSE' merger that likely occurred at $z \approx 2$. Our results provide an all-sky perspective on the emerging picture of our Galaxy's three-phase formation, impelled by the three physical mechanisms of spinup, merger, and cooldown. |
