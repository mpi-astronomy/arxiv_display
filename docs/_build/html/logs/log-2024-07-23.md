|**Abstract**|            We update the HI surface density measurements for a subset of 17 THINGS galaxies by dealing with the short-spacing problem of the original VLA HI images. It is the same sample that Bigiel et al. (2010) used to study the relation between HI surface densities and star formation rate surface densities in galaxy outer disks, which are beyond the optical radius r25. For ten galaxies, the update is based on combining original THINGS VLA HI images with HI images taken by the single-dish FAST in the FEASTS program. The median increment of HI surface densities in outer disks is 0.15 to 0.4 dex at a given new HI surface density. Several galaxies change significantly in the shape of radial profiles HI surface densities, and seven galaxies are now more than 1-$\sigma$ below the HI size-mass relation. We update the HI star formation laws in outer disks. The median relation between HI surface densities and star formation rate surface densities based on pixelwise measurements shifts downward by around 0.15 dex because the HI surface density values shift rightward, and the scatter increases significantly. The scatter of the relation, indicating the star forming efficiency, exhibits a much stronger positive correlation with the stellar mass surface density than before. Thus, detecting the previously missed, diffuse HI due to short-spacing problem of the VLA observation is important in revealing the true condition and variation of star formation possibly regulated by stellar feedbacks in localized environment of outer disks.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present JWST NIRCam imaging targeting 13 $z\sim3$ infrared-luminous ($L_{\rm IR}\sim5\times10^{12}L_{\odot}$) galaxies from the ALESS survey with uniquely deep, high-resolution (0.08$''$$-$0.16$''$) ALMA 870$\mu$m imaging. The 2.0$-$4.4$\mu$m (observed frame) NIRCam imaging reveals the rest-frame near-infrared stellar emission in these submillimeter-selected galaxies (SMGs) at the same (sub-)kpc resolution as the 870$\mu$m dust continuum. The newly revealed stellar morphologies show striking similarities with the dust continuum morphologies at 870$\mu$m, with the centers and position angles agreeing for most sources, clearly illustrating that the spatial offsets reported previously between the 870$\mu$m and HST morphologies were due to strong differential dust obscuration. The F444W sizes are 78$\pm$21% larger than those measured at 870$\mu$m, in contrast to recent results from hydrodynamical simulations that predict larger 870$\mu$m sizes. We report evidence for significant dust obscuration in F444W for the highest-redshift sources, emphasizing the importance of longer-wavelength MIRI imaging. The majority of the sources show evidence that they are undergoing mergers/interactions, including tidal tails/plumes -- some of which are also detected at 870$\mu$m. We find a clear correlation between NIRCam colors and 870$\mu$m surface brightness on $\sim$1 kpc scales, indicating that the galaxies are primarily red due to dust -- not stellar age -- and we show that the dust structure on $\sim$kpc-scales is broadly similar to that in nearby galaxies. Finally, we find no strong stellar bars in the rest-frame near-infrared, suggesting the extended bar-like features seen at 870$\mu$m are highly obscured and/or gas-dominated structures that are likely early precursors to significant bulge growth.         |

|**Abstract**|            Direct imaging of exoplanets allows us to measure positions and chemical signatures of exoplanets. Given the limited resources for space observations where the atmosphere is absent, we want to make these measurements from the ground. However, it is difficult from the ground because it requires an adaptive optics system to provide an extremely well corrected wavefront to enable coronographic techniques. Currently only natural guide star AO systems have demonstrated the necessary wavefront correction for direct imaging of exoplanets. However, using a stellar source as the guide star for wavefront sensing limits the number of exoplanet systems we can directly image because it requires a relatively bright V~10 mag star. To increase the number of observable targets, we need to push the limit of natural guide stars to fainter magnitudes with high Strehl ratio correction. We propose to combine laser guide star (LGS) and natural guide star (NGS) wavefront sensing to achieve the high Strehl correction with fainter natural guide stars. We call this approach Hybrid Atmospheric Phase Analysis (HAPA); 'hapa' in Hawaiian means 'half' or 'of mixed ethnic heritage'. The relatively bright LGS is used for higher order correction, whereas the NGS is used for high accuracy lower order correction. We focus on demonstrating this approach using Robo-AO-2 at the UH 2.2m telescope on Maunakea with a UV Rayleigh laser at 355 nm. The laser focuses at 10 km altitude and has an equivalent magnitude of m_U~8. In this report specifically, we present simulated results of HAPA employed at Robo-AO-2, with the LGS system having a single configuration of 16x16 subaperture Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor and the NGS system having 6 different configurations -- 16x16, 8x8, 5x5, 4x4, 2x2 and 1x1. We also discuss the on-sky experiments we plan to carry out with HAPA at the UH 2.2m telescope.         |

|| Y. Jiang, et al. -- incl., <mark>S. Li</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            A tight correlation between the radio and X-ray emission in the hard state of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) indicates an intrinsic disc-jet connection in stellar black hole accretion systems, though the detailed physics processes at work are still quite unclear. A hot accretion flow is suggested to match the outer cold thin disc at a certain radius in the hard state, which may vary with the accretion rate. In this work, we assume that the magnetic field generated in the outer thin disc is advected inwards by the inner hot accretion flow, which is substantially enhanced near the BH. Such a strong field threading the horizon of a spinning BH is responsible for launching relativistic jets in BHXRBs via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. Thus, both the jet power and the X-ray emission increase with the mass accretion rate, and we find that our model calculations are able to reproduce the observed radio/X-ray correlation quantitatively. For some individual BHXRBs, the slopes of the radio/X-ray correlations become steeper when the sources are brighter. Our model calculations show that this feature is due to the transition of the outer disc with gas pressure dominated to radiation pressure dominated, which leads to different accretion rate dependence of the field strength in the outer disc.         |

|| T.-N. Li, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-07-23*|
|*Comments*| *9 pages, 4 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            The recent results from the first year baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernova (SN) data, have shown a detection of significant deviation from a cosmological constant for dark energy. In this work, we utilize the latest DESI BAO data in combination with the SN data from the full five-year observations of the Dark Energy Survey and the CMB data from the Planck satellite to explore potential interactions between dark energy and dark matter. We consider four typical forms of the interaction term $Q$. Our findings suggest that interacting dark energy (IDE) models with $Q \propto \rho_{\rm de}$ support the presence of an interaction where dark energy decays into dark matter. Specifically, the deviation from $\Lambda$CDM for the IDE model with $Q=\beta H_0\rho_{\rm de}$ reaches the $3\sigma$ level. These models yield a lower value of Akaike information criterion than the $\Lambda$CDM model, indicating a preference for these IDE models based on the current observational data. For IDE models with $Q\propto\rho_{\rm c}$, the existence of interaction depends on the form of the proportionality coefficient $\Gamma$. The IDE model with $Q=\beta H\rho_{\rm c}$ yields $\beta=0.0003\pm 0.0011$, which essentially does not support the presence of the interaction. In general, whether the observational data support the existence of interaction is closely related to the model. Our analysis helps to elucidate which type of IDE model can better explain the current observational data.         |

|**Abstract**|            The 2175 Å bump shows considerable variations in its strength, width, and central wavelength when observed along different sightlines in the Milky Way and other galaxies. These variations offer valuable insights into the composition, size distribution, and processing of interstellar dust grains along different sightlines. This paper introduces a mission concept called UVESS (Ultraviolet Extinction Sky Survey) aimed at exploring the composition of the interstellar medium (ISM) within both the Milky Way and nearby Local Group Galaxies by mapping the variation of UV extinction curve slopes and the 2175 Å feature across a majority of the sky to gain insights into the makeup of the ISM. Recent advancements in UV instrumentation and technologies pave the way for the development of high-throughput instruments in compact form factors. In this paper, we outline mission science goals and instrument concept tailored for a small satellite-based platform dedicated to the study of UV extinction.         |

|**Abstract**|            Recently, DESI has released baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, and DES has also published its five-year supernova (SN) data. These observations, combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, support a dynamically evolving dark energy at a high confidence level. When using cosmological observations to weigh neutrinos, the results of weighing neutrinos will be significantly affected by the measurement of dark energy due to the degeneracy between neutrino mass and the dark-energy equation of state. Therefore, we need to understand how the dynamical evolution of dark energy in the current situation will affect the measurement of neutrino mass. In this work, we utilize these latest observations and other additional distance measurements to discuss the mutual influence between neutrinos and dark energy, then calculate the Bayes factor to compare models. We consider three neutrino mass hierarchies including degenerate hierarchy (DH), normal hierarchy (NH), and inverted hierarchy (IH), as well as three dark energy models including $\Lambda \rm CDM$, $w\rm CDM$, and $w_0w_a \rm CDM$ models. Cosmological data combined with the prior of particle physics experiments can provide strong to decisive evidence favoring the $w_0w_a {\rm CDM}+\sum m_\nu$ model with NH. In the $w_0w_a \rm CDM$ model, using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, we obtain constraints on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu<0.171\ \rm eV,\ 0.204\ \rm eV,\ 0.220\ \rm eV$, for DH, NH, and IH, respectively. Furthermore, taking into account the neutrino hierarchy or incorporating additional distance measurements results in a more pronounced deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model for dark energy. The latter, particularly, exhibits a deviation at a confidence level that surpasses $4\sigma$.         |

|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal (27 pages, 14 figures, 7 tables)*|
|**Abstract**|            We present extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type Ia supernova (SN) 2023wrk at a distance of about 40 Mpc. The earliest detection of this SN can be traced back to a few hours after the explosion. Within the first few days the light curve shows a bump feature, while the B - V color is blue and remains nearly constant. The overall spectral evolution is similar to that of an SN 1991T/SN 1999aa-like SN Ia, while the C II $\lambda6580$ absorption line appears to be unusually strong in the first spectrum taken at $t \approx -$15.4 days after the maximum light. This carbon feature disappears quickly in subsequent evolution but it reappears at around the time of peak brightness. The complex evolution of the carbon line and the possible detection of Ni III absorption around 4700 Å and 5300 Å in the earliest spectra indicate macroscopic mixing of fuel and ash. The strong carbon lines is likely related to collision of SN ejecta with unbound carbon, consistent with the predictions of pulsational delayed-detonation or carbon-rich circumstellar-matter interaction models. Among those carbon-rich SNe Ia with strong C II $\lambda6580$ absorption at very early times, the line-strength ratio of C II to Si II and the B-V color evolution are found to exhibit large diversity, which may be attributed to different properties of unbound carbon and outward-mixing $^{56}$Ni.         |

|| <mark>S. Letchev</mark>, et al. |

|**Abstract**|            Local amplitude aberrations caused by scintillation can impact the reconstruction process of a wavefront sensor (WFS) by inducing a spatially non-uniform intensity at the pupil plane. This effect is especially relevant for the commonly-used Shack-Hartmann WFS (SHWFS), which can lose slope information for portions of the beam where the signal is faint, leading to reduced reconstruction performance and eventually total failure as the level of scintillation increases. An alternative WFS is needed for such conditions. The nonlinear curvature wavefront sensor (nlCWFS) has been shown to achieve better sensitivity compared to the SHWFS under low light levels. Additionally, the nlCWFS has demonstrated the ability to maintain its sensitivity in the presence of scintillation, using amplitude aberrations to help inform the reconstruction process, rather than hinder. Experiments to date have thus far only shown reconstruction results for a single scintillation value. Building upon previous simulations and laboratory experiments, we have built a testbed to quantify the effects of varying scintillation strength on the wavefront reconstruction performance of the nlCWFS compared to an equivalent SHWFS. In this paper, we present results showing the difference in performance between the nlCWFS and SHWFS as a function of relative flux and scintillation strength.         |

|| <mark>X. Zhang</mark>, <mark>G. Green</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-07-23*|
|*Comments*| *Under review, submitted on 1 March*|
|**Abstract**|            Interstellar dust is a major foreground contaminant for many observations and a key component in the chemistry of the interstellar medium, yet its properties remain highly uncertain. Using low-resolution spectra, we accurately measure the extinction curve - a diagnostic of the grain properties - for 130 million stars, orders of magnitude more than previously available, allowing us to map its variation in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds in 3D in unprecedented detail. We find evidence that accretion is the dominant mechanism of grain growth in moderately dense regions, with coagulation dominating at higher densities. Moreover, we find that the extinction curve flattens in star-forming regions, possibly caused by cycling of large grains formed in molecular clouds, or by preferential destruction of small grains by supernova shocks.         |
