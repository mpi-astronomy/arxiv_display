|**Abstract**| The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) has presented first - dynamic-range limited - images of the black hole shadows in M87 and Sgr A*. The next generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) will provide higher sensitivity and higher dynamic range images (and movies) of these two sources plus image at least a dozen others at $\leq$100 gravitational radii resolution. We here perform an exploratory study of the appearance of winds and jets in such future observations. To do this we use M87 and Sgr A* as reference systems: we do not aim to exactly reproduce them, but rather to determine how their observed images will depend on specific physical assumptions. Even in the case of similar or the same dynamics, the images depend significantly on global parameters such as the black hole mass and the mass accretion rate. Our results provide guidance in the interpretation of future high-resolution images, particularly if a wind or jet is detected. |

|**Abstract**| It is difficult to accurately identify galaxy mergers and it is an even larger challenge to classify them by their mass ratio or merger stage. In previous work we used a suite of simulated mergers to create a classification technique that uses linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to identify major and minor mergers. Here, we apply this technique to 1.3 million galaxies from the SDSS DR16 photometric catalog and present the probability that each galaxy is a major or minor merger, splitting the classifications by merger stages (early, late, post-coalescence). We present publicly-available imaging predictor values and all of the above classifications for one of the largest-yet samples of galaxies. We measure the major and minor merger fraction ($f_{\mathrm{merg}}$) and build a mass-complete sample of galaxies, which we bin as a function of stellar mass and redshift. For the major mergers, we find a positive slope of $f_{\mathrm{merg}}$ with stellar mass and negative slope of $f_{\mathrm{merg}}$ with redshift between stellar masses of $10.5 < M_* (log\ M_{\odot}) < 11.6$ and redshifts of $0.03 < z < 0.19$. We are able to reproduce an artificial positive slope of the major merger fraction with redshift when we do not bin for mass or craft a complete sample, demonstrating the importance of mass completeness and mass binning. We determine that the positive trend of the major merger fraction with stellar mass is consistent with a hierarchical assembly scenario. The negative trend with redshift requires that an additional assembly mechanism, such as baryonic feedback, dominates in the local Universe. |

|**Abstract**| Extremely variable quasars can also show strong changes in broad line emission strength, and are known as Changing Look Quasars (CLQs). To study the CLQ transition mechanism, we present a pilot sample of CLQs with X-ray observations both in the bright and faint states. From a sample of quasars with bright state archival SDSS spectra and (Chandra or XMM-Newton) X-ray data, we identified five new CLQs via optical spectroscopic follow-up, and then obtained new target-of-opportunity X-ray observations with Chandra. No strong absorption is detected in either the bright or the faint state X-ray spectra. The intrinsic X-ray flux generally tracks the optical variability, and the X-ray power-law slope becomes harder in the faint state. Large amplitude mid-infrared variability is detected in all five CLQs. The changing-obscuration model is not consistent with the observed X-ray spectra and spectral energy distribution changes seen in these CLQs. It is highly likely that the observed changes are due to the changing accretion rate of the supermassive black hole, so the multiwavelength emission varies accordingly, with promising analogies to the accretion states of X-ray binaries. |

|| <mark>Chengdong Li</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-03-14*|
|*Comments*| *13 pages, 14 figures*|
|**Abstract**| Disc stars from the Gaia DR3 RVS sample are selected to explore the phase spiral as a function of position in the Galaxy. The data reveal a two-armed phase spiral pattern in the local $z-v_z$ plane inside the solar radius, which appears clearly when colour-coded by $\langle v_R \rangle (z,v_z)$: this is characteristic of a breathing mode that can in principle be produced by in-plane non-axisymmetric perturbations. We note that, on the contrary, the phase spiral pattern becomes single armed when outside the solar radius. When a realistic analytic model with an axisymmetric background potential plus a realistic steadily rotating central bar and 2-armed spiral arms as perturbation is used to perform particle test integrations, the pseudo stars get a prominent spiral pattern in the $\langle v_R \rangle$ map in the $x-y$ plane. Additionally, clear breathing mode evidence at a few $\rm{kms}^{-1}$ level can be seen in the $\langle v_z \rangle$ map on the $x-z$ plane, confirming that such breathing modes are non-negligible in the joint presence of a bar and spiral arms. However, no phase-spiral is perceptible in the $(z, v_z)$ plane. When an initial vertical perturbation is added to all pseudo stars and the same orbital integrating scheme is adopted to carry out the simulation, we find that phase spirals can clearly be seen 500~Myr after the perturbation and gradually disappear inside-out; in that case, they are, however, one-armed. Finally, we show as a proof of concept how a toy model of a time-varying non-axisymmetric in-plane perturbation with varying amplitude and pattern speed can, on the other hand, produce a strong two-armed phase-spiral. We conclude that a time-varying strong internal perturbation together with an external vertical perturbation could perhaps explain the transition between the two-armed and one-armed phase-spirals around the Solar radius. |

|**Abstract**| The TIFR Near Infrared Imaging Camera-II (TIRCAM2) is being used at the Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) operated by Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital, Uttarakhand, India. In addition to the normal full frame observations, there has been a requirement for high speed sub-array observations for applications such as lunar occultation and star speckle observations. Fast sub-array modes have been implemented in TIRCAM2 with suitable changes in the camera software at the computer and controller DSP code level. Successful observations have been carried out with the fast sub-array mode of observation. |

|**Abstract**| Connecting the solar wind observed throughout the heliosphere to its origins in the solar corona is one of the central aims of heliophysics. The variability in the magnetic field, bulk plasma, and heavy ion composition properties of the slow wind are thought to result from magnetic reconnection processes in the solar corona. We identify regions of enhanced variability and composition in the solar wind from 2003 April 15 to May 13 (Carrington Rotation 2002), observed by the Wind and Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft, and demonstrate their relationship to the Separatrix-Web (S-Web) structures describing the corona's large-scale magnetic topology. There are four pseudostreamer (PS) wind intervals and two helmet streamer (HS) heliospheric current sheet/plasma sheet crossings (and an ICME) which all exhibit enhanced alpha-to-proton ratios and/or elevated ionic charge states of carbon, oxygen, and iron. We apply the magnetic helicity-partial variance of increments ($H_m$-PVI) procedure to identify coherent magnetic structures and quantify their properties during each interval. The mean duration of these structures are $\sim$1 hr in both the HS and PS wind. We find a modest enhancement above the power-law fit to the PVI waiting time distribution in the HS-associated wind at the 1.5-2 hr timescales that is absent from the PS intervals. We discuss our results in context of previous observations of the $\sim$90 min periodic density structures in the slow solar wind, further development of the dynamic S-Web model, and future Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter joint observational campaigns. |

|**Abstract**| We conduct a systematic tidal disruption event (TDE) demographics analysis using the largest sample of optically selected TDEs. A flux-limited, spectroscopically complete sample of 33 TDEs is constructed using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) over three years (from October 2018 to September 2021). We infer the black hole (BH) mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) with host galaxy scaling relations, showing that the sample $M_{\rm BH}$ ranges from $10^{5.1}\,M_\odot$ to $10^{8.2}\,M_\odot$. We developed a survey efficiency corrected maximum volume method to infer the rates. The rest-frame $g$-band luminosity function (LF) can be well described by a broken power-law of $\phi (L_g)\propto [(L_g / L_{\rm bk})^{0.3} + (L_g / L_{\rm bk})^{2.6}]^{-1}$, with $L_{\rm bk}=10^{43.1}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$. In the BH mass regime of $10^{5.2}\lesssim (M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot) \lesssim 10^{7.2}$, the TDE mass function follows $\phi(M_{\rm BH})\propto M_{\rm BH}^{-0.25}$, which favors a flat local BH mass function ($dn_{\rm BH}/d{\rm log}M_{\rm BH}\approx{\rm constant}$). We confirm the significant rate suppression at the high-mass end ($M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim 10^{7.5}\,M_\odot$), which is consistent with theoretical predictions considering direct capture of hydrogen-burning stars by the event horizon. At a host galaxy mass of $M_{\rm gal}\sim 10^{10}\,M_\odot$, the average optical TDE rate is $\approx 3.2\times 10^{-5}\,{\rm galaxy^{-1}\,yr^{-1}}$. We constrain the optical TDE rate to be [3.7, 7.4, and 1.6$]\times 10^{-5}\,{\rm galaxy^{-1}\,yr^{-1}}$ in galaxies with red, green, and blue colors. |

|| <mark>Zhihe Zhang</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-03-14*|
|*Comments*| *16 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in PRD*|
|**Abstract**| The presence of an extra radio background besides the cosmic microwave background has important implications for the observation of the 21-cm signal during the cosmic Dark Ages, Cosmic Dawn, and epoch of Reionization. The strong absorption trough found in the 21-cm global spectrum measured by the EDGES experiment, which has a much greater depth than the standard model prediction, has drawn great interest to this scenario, but more generally it is still of great interest to consider such a cosmic radio background (CRB) in the early Universe. To be effective in affecting the 21-cm signal at early time, such a radio background must be produced by sources which can emit strong radio signals but modest amount of X-rays, so that the gas is not heated up too early. We investigate the scenario that such a radio background is produced by the primordial black holes (PBHs). For PBH with a single mass, we find that if the PBHs' abundance $\log(f_{\rm PBH})$ (ratio of total PBH mass density to total matter density) and mass satisfy the relation $\log(f_{\rm PBH}) \sim -1.8\log(M_\bullet/{\rm M}_{\odot})-3.5$ for $1\,{\rm M}_\odot \lesssim M_\bullet \lesssim 300 {\rm M}_\odot$, and have jet emission, they can generate a CRB required for reproducing the 21-cm absorption signal seen by the EDGES. The accretion rate can be boosted if the PBHs are surrounded by dark matter halos, which permits lower $f_{\rm PBH}$ value to satisfy the EDGES observation. In the latter scenario, since the accretion rate can evolve rapidly during the Cosmic Dawn, the frequency (redshift) and depth of the absorption trough can determine the mass and abundance of the PBHs simultaneously. For absorption trough redshift $\sim$ 17 and depth $\sim -500$ mK, it corresponds to $M_\bullet \sim 1.05\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ and $f_{\rm PBH}\sim 1.5\times10^{-4}$. |

|**Abstract**| The prompt phase of gamma-ray burst (GRB) contains essential information regarding the physical nature and central engine, which are as yet unknown. In this paper, we investigate the self-organized criticality (SOC) phenomena in GRB prompt phase as done in X-ray flares of GRBs. We obtain the differential and cumulative distributions of 243 short GRB pulses, such as peak flux, FWHM, rise time, decay time, and peak time in the fourth BATSE TTE Catalog with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. It is found that these distributions can be well described by power-law models. In particular, comparisons are made in 182 short GRB pulses in the third Swift GRB Catalog from 2004 December to 2019 July. The results are essentially consistent with those in BATSE ones. We notice that there is no obvious power-law index evolution across different energy bands for either BATSE or Swift sGRBs. The joint analysis suggests that GRB prompt phase can be explained by a Fractal-Diffusive, Self-Organized Criticality (FD-SOC) system with the spatial dimension S = 3 and the classical diffusion ? = 1. Our findings show that GRB prompt phases and X-ray flares possess the very same magnetically dominated stochastic process and mechanism. |

|**Abstract**| Hot Neptunes, gaseous planets smaller than Saturn ($\sim$ 3-8 R$_\oplus$) with orbital periods less than 10 days, are rare. Models predict this is due to high-energy stellar irradiation stripping planetary atmospheres over time, often leaving behind only rocky planetary cores. We present the discovery of a 6.2 R$_\oplus$(0.55 R$_\mathrm{J}$), 19.2 M$_\oplus$(0.060 M$_\mathrm{J}$) planet transiting a red giant star every 4.21285 days. The old age and high equilibrium temperature yet remarkably low density of this planet suggests that its gaseous envelope should have been stripped by high-energy stellar irradiation billions of years ago. The present day planet mass and radius suggest atmospheric stripping was slower than predicted. Unexpectedly low stellar activity and/or late-stage planet inflation could be responsible for the observed properties of this system. |

|**Abstract**| GRB~210704A is a burst of intermediate duration ($T_{90} \sim 1-4$~s) followed by a fading afterglow and an optical excess that peaked about 7 days after the explosion. Its properties, and in particular those of the excess, do not easily fit into the well established classification scheme of GRBs as being long or short, leaving the nature of its progenitor uncertain. We present multi-wavelength observations of the GRB and its counterpart, observed up to 160 days after the burst. In order to decipher the nature of the progenitor system, we present a detailed analysis of the GRB high-energy properties (duration, spectral lag, and Amati correlation), its environment, and late-time optical excess. We discuss three possible scenarios: a neutron star merger, a collapsing massive star, and an atypical explosion possibly hosted in a cluster of galaxies. We find that traditional kilonova and supernova models do not match well the properties of the optical excess, leaving us with the intriguing suggestion that this event was an exotic high-energy merger. |

|**Abstract**| Solar jets are well-collimated plasma ejections in the solar atmosphere. They are prevalent in active regions, the quiet Sun, and even coronal holes. They display a range of temperatures, yet the nature of the cool components has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we show the existence of the precursors and quasi-periodic properties for two chromospheric jets, mainly utilizing the He i 10830 {\AA} narrowband filtergrams taken by the Goode Solar Telescope (GST). The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) counterparts present during the eruption correspond to a blowout jet (jet 1) and a standard jet (jet 2), as observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). The high-resolution He i 10830 {\AA} observation captures a long-lasting precursor for jet 1, signified by a series of cool ejections. They are recurrent jet-like features with a quasi-period of about five minutes. On the other hand, the cool components of jet 2, recurrently accompanied by EUV emissions, present a quasi-periodic behavior with a period of about five minutes. Both the EUV brightening and He i 10830 {\AA} absorption show that there was a precursor for jet 2 that occurred about five minutes before its onset. We propose that the precursor of jet 1 may be the consequence of chromospheric shock waves, since the five-minute oscillation from the photosphere can leak into the chromosphere and develop into shocks. Then, we find that the quasi-periodic behavior of the cool components of jet 2 may be related to magnetic reconnections modulated by the oscillation in the photosphere. |

|**Abstract**| A key first step to constrain the impact of energetic particles in exoplanet atmospheres is to detect the chemical signature of ionisation due to stellar energetic particles and Galactic cosmic rays. We focus on GJ$\,$436, a well-studied M dwarf with a warm Neptune-like exoplanet. We demonstrate how the maximum stellar energetic particle momentum can be estimated from the stellar X-ray luminosity. We model energetic particle transport through the atmosphere of a hypothetical exoplanet at orbital distances between $a=0.01-0.2\,$au from GJ$\,$436, including GJ$\,$436$\,$b's orbital distance (0.028$\,$au). For these distances we find that, at top-of-atmosphere, stellar energetic particles ionise molecular hydrogen at a rate of $\zeta_{\rm StEP,H_2} \sim 4\times10^{-10}-2\times10^{-13}\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. In comparison, Galactic cosmic rays alone lead to $\zeta_{\rm GCR, H_2}\sim2\times 10^{-20}-10^{-18} \,\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. At 10au we find that ionisation due to Galactic cosmic rays equals that of stellar energetic particles: $\zeta_{\rm GCR,H_2} = \zeta_{\rm StEP,H_2} \sim 7\times10^{-18}\,\rm{s^{-1}}$ for the top-of-atmosphere ionisation rate. At GJ$\,$436$\,$b's orbital distance, the maximum ion-pair production rate due to stellar energetic particles occurs at pressure $P\sim 10^{-3}\,$bar while Galactic cosmic rays dominate for $P>10^2\,$bar. These high pressures are similar to what is expected for a post-impact early Earth atmosphere. The results presented here will be used to quantify the chemical signatures of energetic particles in warm Neptune-like atmospheres. |

|**Abstract**| We employ a machine learning (ML) algorithm to analyze cosmological background data and the linear red-shift space distortion (RSD) data in a model-independent way, with specific focus on the Hubble expansion rate and the growth of large-scale structure. We find strong evidence that the natural enhancement in the Hubble parameter at low redshifts is due to the underlying phantom nature of dark energy, rather than low matter density. As for the RSD data, we find a higher value of $\sigma^8_{(0)}$ which is consistent with CMB's predictions, but the outcome of low matter density leads to unresolved tension. This might point towards a new physical phenomenon at the perturbative level in the low redshift regime. From a statistical perspective, we have demonstrated that our results hold greater preference compared to those obtained by the $\Lambda$CDM model. |

|**Abstract**| Using resolved optical stellar photometry from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury Triangulum Extended Region (PHATTER) survey, we measured the star formation history (SFH) near the position of 85 supernova remnants (SNRs) in M33. We constrained the progenitor masses for 60 of these SNRs, finding the remaining 25 remnants had no local SF in the last 56 Myr consistent with core-collapse SNe (CCSNe), making them potential Type Ia candidates. We then infer a progenitor mass distribution from the age distribution, assuming single star evolution. We find that the progenitor mass distribution is consistent with being drawn from a power-law with an index of $-2.9^{+1.2}_{-1.0}$. Additionally, we infer a minimum progenitor mass of $7.1^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$ $M_{\odot}$ from this sample, consistent with several previous studies, providing further evidence that stars with ages older than the lifetimes of single 8 $M_{\odot}$ stars are producing supernovae. |

|**Abstract**| We use the long-slit spectroscopy mode of the VISIR-NEAR experiment to perform diffraction-limited observations of eight nearby Herbig Ae protoplanetary disks. We extract spectra for various locations along the slit with a spectral resolution of R = 300 and perform a compositional fit at each spatial location using spectral templates of silicates and the four PAH bands. This yields the intensity vs. location profiles of each species. Results. We could obtain spatially-resolved intensity profiles of the PAH emission features in the N-band for five objects (AB Aurigae, HD 97048, HD 100546, HD 163296, and HD 169142). We observe two kinds of PAH emission geometry in our sample: centrally-peaked (HD 97048) and ring-like (AB Aurigae, HD 100546, HD 163296, and potentially HD 169142). Comparing the spatial PAH emission profiles with near-infrared scattered light images, we find a strong correlation in the disk sub-structure but a difference in radial intensity decay rate. The PAH emission shows a less steep decline with distance from the star. Finally, we find a correlation between the presence of (sub-) micron-sized silicate grains leading to the depletion of PAH emission within the inner regions of the disks. In this work, we find the following: (1) PAH emission traces the extent of Herbig Ae disks to a considerable radial distance. (2) The correlation between silicate emission within the inner regions of disks and the depletion of PAH emission can result from dust-mixing and PAH coagulation mechanisms and competition over UV photons. (3) For all objects in our sample, PAHs undergo stochastic heating across the entire spatial extent of the disk and are not saturated. (4) The difference in radial intensity decay rates between the PAHs and scattered-light profiles may be attributed to shadowing and dust-settling effects, which affect the scattering grains more than the PAHs. |

|**Abstract**| Radio observations of ultracool dwarfs, objects comprising brown dwarfs and the very lowest mass stars, have mainly focused on analyzing their light-curve and spectral energy distributions providing valuable insights into their magnetic fields. However, spatially-resolved studies of such magnetospheres have been elusive so far. Radio interferometric observations of the brown dwarf LSR J1835+3259 reveal an extended magnetosphere with a morphology compatible with the presence of a radiation belt, similar to that of Jupiter and Earth, consisting of energetic particles confined via magnetic mirroring. Our finding suggests that radio emitting ultracool dwarfs may behave as scaled up versions of Jupiter, validating the connection between dipole-ordered magnetic fields and the presence of belt-like morphologies and aurorae beyond our Solar System. |
