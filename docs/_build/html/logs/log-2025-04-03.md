|**Abstract**|            The standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM, assumes isotropy on large cosmic scales. However, recent studies using galaxy cluster scaling relations reported an apparent $H_0$ anisotropy at $5.4\sigma$ that could be attributed to large bulk flows extending beyond $500\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, in disagreement with $\Lambda$CDM. To quantify the statistical tension of the observational galaxy cluster data used in past studies with $\Lambda$CDM, we utilise the isotropic ($2.8\,\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ run of the FLAMINGO ($\Lambda$CDM) simulations, the largest hydrodynamical cosmological simulation available to date. We create 1728 simulated lightcones and study the apparent level of anisotropy traced by X-ray and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich scaling relations in the same cluster sample selection and methodology as in Migkas et al. (2021, arXiv:2103.13904). We find the probability of such apparent anisotropies randomly emerging in cluster scaling relations within a $\Lambda$CDM universe to be $0.12\%\, (3.2\sigma)$. The discrepancy goes up to $\sim 3.6\sigma$ when modelled as a bulk flow at $z < 0.1$. We find that statistical noise accounts for over $80\%$ of the anisotropy amplitude in each lightcone, with large peculiar velocities contributing less than $20\%$. We also show that anisotropy amplitudes are highly sensitive to the intrinsic scatter in the scaling relations, with tighter relations providing stronger constraints. Nevertheless, the tension between Migkas et al. (2021, arXiv:2103.13904) and $\Lambda$CDM persists, however, at a lower significance than previously reported.         |

|| P. Rinaldi, et al. -- incl., <mark>F. Walter</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            We present a comprehensive analysis of the MIRI Extremely Red Object Virgil, a Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter at $z_{spec} = 6.6379 \pm 0.0035$ with the photometric properties of a Little Red Dot. Leveraging new JWST/MIRI imaging from the MIDIS and PAHSPECS programs, we confirm Virgil's extraordinary nature among galaxies in JADES/GOODS-South, exhibiting a strikingly red NIRCam-to-MIRI color (F444W $-$ F1500W = $2.84\pm0.04$~mag). Deep NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy from the OASIS program offers key insights into the host galaxy, revealing properties of an average star-forming galaxy during Cosmic Reionization, such as a subsolar metallicity, low-to-moderate dust content, and a relatively high ionization parameter and electron temperature. By estimating the star formation rate of Virgil from UV and H$\alpha$, we find evidence that the galaxy is either entering or fading out of a bursty episode. Although line-ratio diagnostics employed at high-$z$ would classify Virgil as an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), this classification becomes ambiguous once redshift evolution is considered. Nonetheless, Virgil occupies the same parameter space as recently confirmed AGNs at similar redshifts. The new deep MIRI data at 15~$\mu$m reinforce the AGN nature of Virgil, as inferred from multiple spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes. Virgil's rising infrared SED and UV excess resemble those of Dust-Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) studied with Spitzer at Cosmic Noon, particularly blue-excess HotDOGs. Our results highlight the need for a multi-wavelength approach incorporating MIRI to uncover such extreme sources at $z\gtrsim6$ and to shed light on the interplay between galaxy evolution and early black hole growth during Cosmic Reionization.         |

|| I.-N. Chiu, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            We present the weak-lensing mass calibration of 124 galaxy clusters and groups at redshift $0.1<z<0.8$ in the first Data Release of the $eROSITA$ All-Sky Survey ($eRASS1$) and constrain their BCG stellar-mass-to-halo-mass-and-redshift relation, using the data sets from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program. The cluster survey is conducted by the $eROSITA$ X-ray telescope aboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma space observatory. The cluster sample is X-ray-selected and optically confirmed with a negligibly low contamination rate. On a basis of individual clusters, the shear profiles of $96$ clusters are derived using the HSC Three-Year weak-lensing data, while the BCG stellar masses $M_{\star,\mathrm{BCG}}$ of $101$ clusters are estimated using the SED template fitting to the HSC five-band photometry. The count rate ($C_{\mathrm{R}}-M-z$) and BCG stellar mass ($M_{\star,\mathrm{BCG}}-M-z$) relations are simultaneously constrained in a population modelling. The $C_{\mathrm{R}}-M-z$ relation reveals a mass trend of $\propto M^{1.50^{+0.20}_{-0.30}}$, which is steeper than the self-similar prediction, and no deviation from the self-similar redshift scaling. We obtain the power-law indices of the mass ($B_{\mathrm{BCG}} = 0.25^{+0.11}_{-0.15}$) and redshift ($\gamma_{\mathrm{BCG}} = 0.87^{+0.92}_{-0.78}$) scaling for the $M_{\star,\mathrm{BCG}}-M-z$ relation, and find a strong degeneracy between them. By adopting an informative prior on $\gamma_{\mathrm{BCG}}$ to break the degeneracy, we obtain a statistically consistent $M_{\star,\mathrm{BCG}}-M-z$ relation. Our results suggest that the BCG stellar mass at a fixed halo mass has remained stable with a moderate increase since redshift $z\approx0.8$. This finding supports the picture of the ``rapid-then-slow'' BCG formation, where the majority of the stellar mass must have been assembled at much earlier cosmic time.         |

|**Abstract**|            This paper provides a comprehensive introduction to the Mini-SiTian Real-Time Image Processing pipeline (STRIP) and evaluates its operational performance. The STRIP pipeline is specifically designed for real-time alert triggering and light curve generation for transient sources. By applying the STRIP pipeline to both simulated and real observational data of the Mini-SiTian survey, it successfully identified various types of variable sources, including stellar flares, supernovae, variable stars, and asteroids, while meeting requirements of reduction speed within 5 minutes. For the real observational dataset, the pipeline detected 1 flare event, 127 variable stars, and 14 asteroids from three monitored sky regions. Additionally, two datasets were generated: one, a real-bogus training dataset comprising 218,818 training samples, and the other, a variable star light curve dataset with 421 instances. These datasets will be used to train machine learning algorithms, which are planned for future integration into STRIP.         |

|*Comments*| *11 pages, 2 figures, Accepted for publication in a special issue of Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics on the Mini-SiTian Array*|
|**Abstract**|            This paper outlines the scientific goals and observational strategies of the Mini-SiTian array. Mounted at Xinglong Observatory, the Mini-SiTian array consists of three 30 cm telescopes and has been in operation since 2022. The large field of view, combined with the capability for multi-band photometric observations, enables the Mini-SiTian array to perform rapid follow-up observations to identify optical counterparts of gravitational waves, capture the early light curves of tidal disruption events and supernovae, and monitor stellar flares, Be star outbursts, and cataclysmic variable stars, although its limiting magnitude is not very deep. By collaborating with the Xinglong 2.16-m telescope and leveraging a real-time image processing pipeline, simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic observations could be performed to reveal their underlying physical mechanisms. The observational and research experience provide critical guidance for the implementation of the full-scale SiTian project in the future.         |

|**Abstract**|            The SiTian Project represents a groundbreaking initiative in astronomy, aiming to deploy a global network of telescopes, each with a 1-meter aperture, for comprehensive time-domain sky surveys. The network's innovative architecture features multiple observational nodes, each comprising three strategically aligned telescopes equipped with filters. This design enables three-color (g, r, i) channel imaging within each node, facilitating precise and coordinated observations. As a pathfinder to the full-scale project, the Mini-SiTian Project serves as the scientific and technological validation platform, utilizing three 30-centimeter aperture telescopes to validate the methodologies and technologies planned for the broader SiTian network. This paper focuses on the development and implementation of the Master Control System (MCS),and the central command hub for the Mini-SiTian array. The MCS is designed to facilitate seamless communication with the SiTian Brain, the project's central processing and decision-making unit, while ensuring accurate task allocation, real-time status monitoring, and optimized observational workflows. The system adopts a robust architecture that separates front-end and back-end functionalities.A key innovation of the MCS is its ability to dynamically adjust observation plans in response to transient source alerts, enabling rapid and coordinated scans of target sky regions...(abridged)         |

|**Abstract**|            We simulate the optical searching of gravitational-wave electromagnetic counterpart of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger event (i.e., a kilonova) using the ground based {\it SiTian} project prototype telescope with a 5-min limiting magnitude of 22.0, triggered by LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors during the ongoing O4 run. Our simulations show that an average of 0.17-0.25 kilonova events can be observed over the entire O4 period of $\sim 2$ years in the most optimistic case we set, while no kilonova can be detected in other cases. We note that it is beneficial for {\it SiTian}'s kilonova searching by extending the exposure time to gain deeper limiting magnitude despite the rapid decline of kilonova luminosity.         |

|**Abstract**|            As a pathfinder of the SiTian project, the Mini-SiTian (MST) array, employed three commercial CMOS cameras, represents a next-generation, cost-effective optical time-domain survey project. This paper focuses primarily on the precise data processing pipeline designed for wide-field, CMOS-based devices, including the removal of instrumental effects, astrometry, photometry, and flux calibration. When applying this pipeline to approximately 3000 observations taken in the Field 02 (f02) region by MST, the results demonstrate a remarkable astrometric precision of approximately 70--80\,mas (about 0.1\,pixel), an impressive calibration accuracy of approximately 1\,mmag in the MST zero points, and a photometric accuracy of about 4\,mmag for bright stars. Our studies demonstrate that MST CMOS can achieve photometric accuracy comparable to that of CCDs, highlighting the feasibility of large-scale CMOS-based optical time-domain surveys and their potential applications for cost optimization in future large-scale time-domain surveys, like the SiTian project.         |

|| <mark>J. Li</mark>, et al. |

|**Abstract**|            W Ursa Majoris (W UMa)-type contact binary systems (CBs) with period--luminosity (PL) relations are valuable distance indicators. The PL relations of CBs are affected by metallicity. Here, we establish PL relations and period--luminosity--metallicity (PLZ) relations in nine bands from optical to mid-infrared ($BP$, $G$, $RP$, $J$, $H$, $K_S$, $W1$, $W2$, $W3$) and in five Wesenheit bands based on Gaia DR3 parallaxes. The dispersion of PLZ relations gradually decreases from the optical to mid-infrared bands, with the minimum dispersion of 0.138 mag. We fit the best PL relations for three bands ($W1$, $W_{G,BP,RP}$, $W_{W1,BP,RP}$) under different parallax uncertainty criteria and determine a parallax (after correction) zero point of $zp_\varpi=24\pm4$ $\mu$as. After fixing the parallax zero point, we find that the total zero errors of the PL and PLZ relation are smallest when the parallax uncertainty is less than 2\%, resulting in a calibrated CB luminosity with an accuracy of 0.33\%, which is more accurate than the classical Cepheids. Furthermore, by examining the absolute magnitude residuals in different metallicity intervals, we find that the use of a linear metallicity effect is appropriate for CBs with different metallicities. These results indicate that CBs are excellent standard candles.         |
