|**Abstract**|            New extragalactic measurements of the cloud population-averaged star formation (SF) efficiency per freefall time $\rm\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ from PHANGS show little sign of theoretically predicted dependencies on cloud-scale virial level or velocity dispersion. We explore ways to bring theory into consistency with observations, highlighting systematic variations in internal density structure that must happen together with an increase in virial level typical towards galaxy centers. To introduce these variations into conventional turbulence-regulated SF models we adopt three adjustments motivated by the host galaxy's influence on the cloud-scale: we incorporate self-gravity and a gas density distribution that contains a broad power-law (PL) component and resembles the structure observed in local resolved clouds, we let the internal gas kinematics include motion in the background potential and let this regulate the onset of self-gravitation, and we assume that the gas density distribution is in a steady-state for only a fraction of a freefall time. The combined result is a strong reduction to $\rm\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ predicted in multi-freefall (MFF) scenarios compared to purely lognormal probability density functions and variations that are tied to the PL slope $\alpha$. The $\alpha$ needed to match PHANGS $\rm\epsilon_{\rm ff}$'s vary systematically with environment in the sense that gas sitting furthest from virial balance contains more gas at high density. With this `galaxy regulation' behavior included, our `self-gravitating' sgMFF models function similar to the original, roughly `virialized cloud' single-freefall models. However, outside disks with their characteristic regulation, the flexible MFF models may be better suited.         |

|**Abstract**|            Stellar abundances, coupled with kinematics are a unique way to understand the chemo-dynamical processes that occurred to build the Milky Way and its local volume as we observe today. However, measuring abundances is challenging as one needs to properly address the effect of departure from the Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), as well as the commonly used 1-dimensional model atmosphere. In this work, we constrain the chemical evolution of [O/Fe] in FG stars of the RAVE survey with [O/Fe] abundances derived in non-LTE (NLTE) and with horizontally-temporally-averaged 3D (<3D>) model atmospheres. Using standard spectral fitting method, we determine for the first time LTE and NLTE [O/Fe] ratios from the O triplet at 8446A in turn-off and dwarf stars thanks to intermediate-resolution RAVE spectra, assuming both 1D and <3D> model atmosphere. NLTE effects play a significant role when determining oxygen even at a resolution of R= 7500. Typical NLTE-LTE corrections of the order of -0.12 dex are measured in dwarfs and turn-off stars using 1D MARCS models. In contrast to applying <3D> NLTE abundance corrections or the classical 1D LTE, the full <3D> NLTE spectral fitting yields improving the precision of abundances by nearly 10%. We show that the decrease of [O/Fe] in the super-solar [Fe/H] regime is rather characterised by a flat trend when [O/Fe] is computed in <3D> NLTE from full spectral fitting. We attribute this flattening at super-solar [Fe/H] to the interplay between locally born stars with negative [O/Fe] and stars migrated from the inner MW regions with super-solar [O/Fe], supporting the complex chemo-dynamical history of the Solar neighbourhood. Our results are key for understanding the effects of <3D> and NLTE when measuring [O/Fe]. This work is a test bed for the analysis of 4MOST low-resolution spectra that will share similar properties as RAVE in the red wavelength domain.         |

|**Abstract**|            About 30\% of disk galaxies show lopsidedness in their stellar disk. Although such a large-scale asymmetry in the disk can be primarily looked upon as a long-lived mode ($m=1$), the physical origin of the lopsidedness in the disk continues to be a puzzle. In this work, we develop an automated approach to identify lopsided galaxies from the SDSS DR18 using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) based on the publicly available AlexNet architecture. We select nearly face-on spiral galaxies from SDSS DR18 with the Petrosian 90\% light radius (\textit{petroR90\_i}) greater than $20^{''}$. Based on the visual inspection, we choose 106 lopsided spiral galaxies and 105 symmetric spiral galaxies, as our training set. Our trained model achieves a testing accuracy of 92.8\% at the end of 150 epochs. We then employ the trained model on a set of 813 face-on spiral galaxies from SDSS DR18 with $17^{''} \le petroR90\_i \le 20^{''} $ and identify 452 new lopsided spiral galaxies. We next investigate the cosmic web environments in which the galaxies are located, using the Hessian matrix of the density field. We find that 39\% of the lopsided galaxies are located in sparser environments such as sheets and voids. This may provide interesting clues towards understanding the origin of lopsidedness in isolated galaxies, where distortion due to the tidal interactions is less frequent.         |

|**Abstract**|            The spatial distribution and clustering property of massive and luminous galaxies have provided important constraints on the fundamental cosmological parameters and physical processes governing galaxy formation. In this work, we construct and compare independent galaxy-halo connection models in the application of clustering measurement at non-linear scales of BOSS-CMASS galaxies. In particular, we adopt a halo occupation distribution (HOD) model with 11 parameters and a semi-analytical model (SAM) with 16 parameters to describe the galaxy correlation function including the projected correlation function, redshift space monopole and quadrupole. We focus on the redshift space distortion effect caused by the galaxy peculiar velocity. With a empirical model for the velocity field and the emulator technique, we can explore the parameter space of both models. We find that the HOD model is able to recover the underlying velocity field of SAM with an accuracy of 3\%, and can be improved to 1\% when the analysis is restricted to scales above 1$h^{-1}$Mpc. The comparison is based on multiple samplings in the parameter space which can verify the convergence of the empirical and physical model for galaxy formation. Then we perform constraints on the model parameters using clustering measurement of CMASS galaxies. Although limited by the emulator accuracy and the flexibility of the model, we find that the clustering measurement is capable of constraining a subset of the SAM parameters, especially for components sensitive to the star formation rate. This result leads us to anticipate that a joint analysis of both clustering and abundance measurements can significantly constrain the parameters of galaxy formation physics, which requires further investigation from both theoretical and observational aspects.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report on results of the on-ground X-ray calibration of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) built from novel lobster-eye micro-pore optics, onboard the Einstein Probe (EP) satellite. To fully characterize the instrumental performance and properties, a series of tests and calibrations have been carried out at different levels of devices, assemblies and the complete module before the launch of EP. In this paper, we present the calibration results of three flight model modules (FM1, FM5 and FM11) obtained during their end-to-end module calibration experiments carried out at the 100-m X-ray Test Facility (100XF) of IHEP, CAS. Measurements of the Point Spread Function (PSF), effective area, and energy response were performed for multiple incident directions and several characteristic X-ray emission line energies. Specifically, the distributions of the PSF and effective areas are found to be roughly uniform across the FoV, in large agreement with the prediction of lobster-eye optics. Their energy dependence behavior aligns well with theoretical predictions and Monte Carlo simulations. At 1.25 keV, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the focal spot is in range of 3-7 arcmin (a median of 4.2) and the effective area in range of 2-3 $cm^2$. Noticeably, the flight model instruments demonstrate a $\sim1.5$ arcmin spatial resolution improvement over the previously launched Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy. The properties of the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors were also calibrated. The gain coefficients are in range of 6.4-6.9 eV/DN. The energy resolutions are in range of 120-140 eV at 1.25 keV, meeting design requirements. These calibration results have been ingested into the first version of calibration database (CALDB) and applied to the analysis of the scientific data acquired by WXT after the launch of EP.         |

|**Abstract**|            X-ray Polarimeter Satellite (XPoSat) with POLarimeter Instrument in X-rays (POLIX), is India's first spacecraft dedicated to study medium energy X-ray polarisation from celestial objects. X-Ray Spectroscopy and Timing (XSPECT) instrument on XPoSat is configured to study long term spectral behaviour of select sources in Soft X-ray regime. The instrument uses Swept Charge Devices (SCD)s to provide large area and spectral performance with passive cooling arrangement. The instrument consists of set of collimators with two different FOVs, optical light blocking filters, and signal processing electronics. The instrument was designed, tested and calibrated on ground. The unique opportunity is provided by ISRO's XPoSat mission, where a source is observed for longer duration. The device used also enables spectroscopy study of brighter sources compared to the CCD based spectrometers. The first results demonstrate instrument capability for spectral studies in the 0.8 keV-15 keV energy band.         |
