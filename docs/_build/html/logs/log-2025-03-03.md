|**Abstract**|            Dust is a fundamental component of the interstellar medium (ISM) within galaxies, as dust grains are highly efficient absorbers of UV and optical photons. Accurately quantifying this obscuration is crucial for interpreting galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The extinction curves in the Milky Way (MW) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) exhibit a strong feature known as the 2175A UV bump, most often attributed to small carbonaceous dust grains. This feature was recently detected in faint galaxies out to z~7 suggesting rapid formation channels. Here we report the detection of a strong UV bump in a luminous Lyman-break galaxy at z = 7.11235, GNWY-7379420231, through observations taken as part of the NIRSpec Wide GTO survey. We fit a dust attenuation curve that is consistent with the MW extinction curve within 1{\sigma}, in a galaxy just ~700 Myr after the Big Bang. From the integrated spectrum, we infer a young mass-weighted age (t* ~ 22-59 Myr) for this galaxy, however spatially resolved SED fitting unveils the presence of an older stellar population (t* ~ 252 Myr). Furthermore, morphological analysis provides evidence for a potential merger. The underlying older stellar population suggests the merging system could be pre-enriched, with the dust illuminated by a merger-induced starburst. Moreover, turbulence driven by stellar feedback in this bursty region may be driving PAH formation through top-down shattering. The presence of a UV bump in GNWY-7379420231 solidifies growing evidence for the rapid evolution of dust properties within the first billion years of cosmic time.         |

|**Abstract**|            While the number of detected molecules, particularly complex organic molecules, in the solid-state in astrophysical environments is still rather limited, laboratory experiments and astrochemical models predict many potential candidates. Detection of molecules in protoplanetary disks provides a bridge between the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium and the chemistry of planets and their atmospheres. The excellent spectral sensitivity, broad wavelength coverage and high spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allows for making progress in exploring chemical compositions of various astrophysical environments including planet-forming disks. They are a prerequisite for probing the disk content by means of sensitive absorption studies. In this paper, we present initial results of the JWST Cycle 1 GO program 1741 on d216-0939, a highly inclined TTauri disk located in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We utilise the NIRSpec and MIRI integral field unit spectrographs to cover its spectrum from 1.7 to 28~$\mu$m. In the d216-0939 disk, we give assignments of the composition of silicate grains. We unambiguously detect solid-state features of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, CO, OCN$^-$, and tentatively OCS; species that had been detected recently also in other circumstellar disks. For the first time in disks, we provide unique detections of ices carrying NH$_4^+$ and the complex organic molecule ammonium carbamate (NH$_4^+$NH$_2$COO$^-$). The latter detections speak for a very efficient NH$_3$ chemistry in the disk. We also show the very important role of scattering in the analysis of observational spectra of highly inclined disks.         |

|**Abstract**|            The cosmic 21-cm signal promises to revolutionize studies of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Radio interferometers are aiming for a preliminary, low signal-to-noise (S/N) detection of the 21-cm power spectrum. Cross-correlating 21-cm with galaxies will be especially useful in these efforts, providing both a sanity check for initial 21-cm detection claims and potentially increasing the S/N due to uncorrelated residual systematics. Here we self-consistently simulate large-scale (1 Gpc) galaxy and 21-cm fields, computing their cross-power spectra for various choices of instruments as well as survey properties. We use 1080h observations with SKA-low AA* and HERA-350 as our benchmark 21-cm observations. We create mock Lyman alpha narrow-band, slitless and slit spectroscopic surveys, using benchmarks from instruments such as Subaru HyperSupremeCam, Roman grism, VLT MOONS, ELT MOSAIC, and JWST NIRCam. We forecast the resulting S/N of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum, varying the galaxy survey area, depth and level of 21-cm foreground contamination for each pair of instruments. We find that the highest S/N is achievable through slitless, wide-area spectroscopic surveys, with the proposed Roman HLS survey resulting in a 55$\sigma$ detection of the cross power with 21-cm as observed with SKA-low AA* for our fiducial model. Narrow-band dropout surveys are unlikely to result in a detectable cross-power, due to their poor redshift localization. Slit spectroscopy can provide a high S/N detection of the cross power for SKA-low AA* observations. Specifically, the planned MOONRISE survey with MOONS on the VLT can result in a 3$\sigma$ detection, while a survey of comparable observing time using MOSAIC on the ELT can result in a 4$\sigma$ detection. Our results can be used to guide survey strategies, facilitating the detection of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present polarization pulse profiles for 56 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) monitored by the Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) collaboration using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The observations centered at 1.25 GHz with a raw bandwidth of 500 MHz. Due to the high sensitivity ($\sim$16 K/Jy) of the FAST telescope and our long integration time, the high signal-to-noise ratio polarization profiles show features hardly detected before. Among 56 pulsars, the polarization profiles of PSRs J0406$+$3039, J1327$+$3423, and J2022$+$2534 were not previously reported. 80\% of MSPs in the sample show weak components below 3\% of peak flux, 25\% of pulsars show interpulse-like structures, and most pulsars show linear polarization position angle jumps. Six pulsars seem to be emitting for full rotation phase, with another thirteen pulsars being good candidates for such a 360$^\circ$ radiator. We find that the distribution of the polarization percentage in our sample is compatible with the normal pulsar distribution. Our detailed evaluation of the MSP polarization properties suggests that the wave propagation effects in the pulsar magnetosphere are important in shaping the MSP polarization pulse profiles.         |

|**Abstract**|            M giants, with their distinctive properties such as high luminosity, serve as excellent indicators for mapping the structure of the Milky Way. The distance to distant M giants can be determined by using the color-magnitude relation (CMR), which is derived from color-magnitude diagrams of specific systems in previous studies. In this work, we aimed to achieve more accurate distance determination for M giants by focusing on open clusters (OCs) with a large number of member stars and thus improve the CMR. For the first time, we compiled a census of OCs harboring M giants using Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) and Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope Data Release 9. We identified 58 M giants associated with 43 OCs and obtained their astrometric and photometric parameters from Gaia DR3. Using the distances of these OCs, we derived the CMR for M giants as a linear correlation, expressed as $M_{Ks}=3.85-8.26(J-K_s$). This linear relation proved superior to the empirical distance relation in characterizing the CMR of M giants. The photometric distances of M giants derived from the CMR are consistent with the parallax distances from Gaia and known spectroscopic distances, with median deviations of 1.5% and 2.3%, respectively. Using the distances of M giants derived from the CMR, we computed their radial velocity ($V_R$), azimuthal velocity ($V{\phi}$), and vertical velocity ($V_Z$), respectively. The distributions of these velocities revealed key features of the Galactic disk, including oscillation, north-south rotational asymmetry, and warp. These findings are consistent with previous studies and further validate the reliability of the derived CMR.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2025-03-03*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            With its extreme axial tilt, radiant energy budget and internal heat of Uranus remain among the most intriguing mysteries of our Solar System. Here, we present the global radiant energy budget spanning a complete orbital period, revealing significant seasonal variations driven primarily by the highly variable solar flux. Despite these fluctuations, emitted thermal power consistently exceeds absorbed solar power, indicating a net energy loss and ongoing global cooling. Based on the seasonal variations of radiant energy budget, we determine a statistically significant internal heat flux. This finding resolves a long-standing debate over whether Uranus possesses internal heat. We also examine the energy budget of the weather layer by combining the internal heat with the radiant energies, revealing significant energy imbalances at both global and hemispheric scales. These global and hemispheric imbalances should be considered in theoretical and numerical models. The Uranus flagship mission, as recommended by the recent survey, will provide crucial observations to address more unresolved questions and advance our understanding of this enigmatic ice giant.         |
