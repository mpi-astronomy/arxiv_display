|**Abstract**| We analyze the far-ultraviolet spectroscopy of 20 young and massive star clusters (YSCs) in 11 nearby star-forming galaxies. We probe the interstellar gas intervening along the line of sight, detecting several metal absorption lines of a wide range of ionization potentials, from 6.0 eV to 77.5 eV. Multiple-component Voigt fits to the absorption lines are used to study the kinematics of the gas. We find that nearly all targets in the sample feature gas outflowing from 30 up to 190 km per second, often both in the neutral and ionized phase. The outflow velocities correlate with the underlying stellar population properties directly linked to the feedback: the mass of the YSCs, the photon production rate and the instantaneous mechanical luminosity produced by stellar winds and SNe. We detect a neutral inflow in 4 targets, which we interpret as likely not associated with the star cluster but tracing larger scale gas kinematics. A comparison between the outflows energy and that produced by the associated young stellar populations suggests an average coupling efficiency of 10 per cent with a broad scatter. Our results extend the relation found in previous works between galactic outflows and the host galaxy star-formation rate to smaller scales, pointing towards the key role that clustered star formation and feedback play in regulating galaxy growth. |

|**Abstract**| The Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS) is an on-going program to observe nearly a hundred low-redshift X-ray-luminous galaxy clusters (redshifts $0.03<z<0.12$ and X-ray luminosities in the 0.1-2.4 keV band $L_{X500c}>10^{44}$ erg/s) with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), capturing data in $u,g,r,i,z$ bands with a $5\sigma$ point source depth of approximately 25-26th AB magnitudes. Here, we map the aperture masses in 58 galaxy cluster fields using weak gravitational lensing. These clusters span a variety of dynamical states, from nearly relaxed to merging systems, and approximately half of them have not been subject to detailed weak lensing analysis before. In each cluster field, we analyze the alignment between the 2D mass distribution described by the aperture mass map, the 2D red-sequence (RS) galaxy distribution, and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We find that the orientations of the BCG and the RS distribution are strongly aligned throughout the interiors of the clusters: the median misalignment angle is 19 deg within 2 Mpc. We also observe the alignment between the orientations of the RS distribution and the overall cluster mass distribution (by a median difference of 32 deg within 1 Mpc), although this is constrained by galaxy shape noise and the limitations of our cluster sample size. These types of alignment suggest long-term dynamical evolution within the clusters over cosmic timescales. |

|**Abstract**| The far-infrared (FIR) opacity of dust in dark clouds within the Ophiuchus molecular cloud is investigated through multi-wavelength infrared observations from UKIDSS, Spitzer and Herschel. Employing the infrared color excess technique with both near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) photometric data, a high-resolution extinction map in the $K$ band ($A_K$) is constructed for three dark clouds: L1689, L1709, and L1712. The derived extinction map has a resolution of $1'$ and reaches a depth of $A_K\sim3$ mag. The FIR optical depths $\tau_{250}$ at a reference wavelength of $250\,\rm \mu m$ are obtained by fitting the Herschel PACS and SPIRE continuum data at 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500 $\rm \mu m$ using a modified blackbody model. The average dust opacity per unit gas mass at $250\rm \mu m$, $r\kappa_{250}$ is determined through a pixel-by-pixel correlation of $\tau_{250}$ with $A_K$, yielding a value of approximately $0.09\,\rm cm^2\,g^{-1}$, which is about 2-3 times higher than the typical value in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). Additionally, an independent analysis across 16 sub-regions within the Ophiuchus cloud indicates spatial variations in dust opacity, with values ranging from 0.07-0.12$\,\rm cm^2\,g^{-1}$. Although the observed trend of increasing dust opacity with higher extinction implies grain growth, our findings indicate that rapid grain growth clearly not yet occurred in the dark clouds studied in this work. |
