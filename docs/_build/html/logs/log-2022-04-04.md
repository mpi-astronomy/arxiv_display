|**Abstract**| Stellar dynamos generate magnetic fields that are of fundamental importance to the variability and evolution of Sun-like and low-mass stars, and for the development of their planetary systems. We report measurements of surface-average magnetic fields in 292 M dwarfs from a comparison with radiative transfer calculations; for 260 of them, this is the first measurement of this kind. Our data were obtained from more than 15,000 high-resolution spectra taken during the CARMENES project. They reveal a relation between average field strength, <B>, and Rossby number, $Ro$, resembling the well-studied rotation-activity relation. Among the slowly rotating stars, we find that magnetic flux, $\Phi_\textrm{B}$, is proportional to rotation period, $P$, and among the rapidly rotating stars that average surface fields do not grow significantly beyond the level set by the available kinetic energy. Furthermore, we find close relations between nonthermal coronal X-ray emission, chromospheric H$\alpha$ and Ca H&K emission, and magnetic flux. Taken together, these relations demonstrate empirically that the rotation-activity relation can be traced back to a dependence of the magnetic dynamo on rotation. We advocate the picture that the magnetic dynamo generates magnetic flux on the stellar surface proportional to rotation rate with a saturation limit set by the available kinetic energy, and we provide relations for average field strengths and nonthermal emission that are independent of the choice of the convective turnover time. We also find that Ca H&K emission saturates at average field strengths of $\langle B \rangle \approx 800$ G while H$\alpha$ and X-ray emission grow further with stronger fields in the more rapidly rotating stars. This is in conflict with the coronal stripping scenario predicting that in the most rapidly rotating stars coronal plasma would be cooled to chromospheric temperatures. |

|| Evan H. Anders, et al. -- incl., <mark>Benjamin P. Brown</mark>, <mark>Eric W. Hester</mark> |
|*Comments*| *7 pages, 3 figures, 1 moose, no logic in this place*|
|**Abstract**| Stars with masses $\gtrsim 4 \times 10^{27}M_{\rm{moose}} \approx 1.1 M_\odot$ have core convection zones during their time on the main sequence. In these moosive stars, convection introduces many uncertainties in stellar modeling. In this Letter, we build upon the Boussinesq approximation to present the first-ever simulations of Moosinesq convection, which captures the complex geometric structure of the convection zones of these stars. These flows are bounded in a manner informed by the majestic terrestrial Alces alces (moose) and could have important consequences for the evolution of these stars. We find that Moosinesq convection results in very interesting flow morphologies and rapid heat transfer, and posit this as a mechanism of biomechanical thermoregulation. |

|| James Prideaux-Ghee, et al. -- incl., <mark>Alan Heavens</mark> |
|*Comments*| *21 pages, 14 figures. Comments welcome*|
|**Abstract**| We present a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach to reconstruct the initial cosmic matter density field constrained by peculiar velocity observations. As our approach features a model for the gravitational evolution of dark matter to connect the initial conditions to late-time observations, it reconstructs the final density and velocity fields as natural byproducts. We implement this field-based physical inference approach by adapting the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm, which explores the high-dimensional posterior through the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. We test the self-consistency of the method using random sets of mock tracers, and assess its accuracy in a more complex scenario where peculiar velocity tracers are non-linearly evolved mock haloes. We find that our framework self-consistently infers the initial conditions, density and velocity fields, and shows some robustness to model mis-specification. As compared to the state-of-the-art approach of constrained Gaussian random fields/Wiener filtering, our method produces more accurate final density and velocity field reconstructions. It also allows us to constrain the initial conditions by peculiar velocity observations, complementing in this aspect previous field-based approaches based on other cosmological observables. |

|| David R. Aguilera-Dena, et al. -- incl., <mark>Bernhard Müller</mark>, <mark>Norbert Langer</mark> |
|*Comments*| *30 pages, 20 figures, submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics*|
|**Abstract**| Stripped-envelope stars can be observed as Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, or as less luminous hydrogen-poor stars with low mass loss rates and transparent winds. Both types are potential progenitors of Type I core-collapse supernovae (SNe). We use grids of core-collapse models obtained from helium stars at different metallicities to study the effects of metallicity on the transients and remnants these stars produce. We characterise the surface and core properties of our core collapse models, and investigate their explodability employing three criteria. In cases where explosions are predicted, we estimate the ejecta mass, explosion energy, nickel mass and neutron star (NS) mass. Otherwise, we predict the mass of the resulting black hole (BH). We construct a simplified population model, and find that the properties SNe and compact objects depend strongly on metallicity. Ejecta masses and explosion energies for Type Ic SNe are best reproduced by models with Z=0.04 which exhibit strong winds during core helium burning. This implies that either their mass loss rates are underestimated, or that Type Ic SN progenitors experience mass loss through other mechanisms before exploding. The distributions of ejecta masses, explosion energies and nickel mass for Type Ib SNe are not well reproduced by progenitor models with WR mass loss, but are better reproduced if we assume no mass loss in progenitors with luminosities below the minimum WR star luminosity. We find that Type Ic SNe become more common as metallicity increases, and that the vast majority of progenitors of Type Ib SNe must be transparent-wind stripped-envelope stars. We find several models with pre-collapse CO-masses of up to $\sim 30 M_{\odot}$ may form $\sim 3 M_{\odot}$ BHs in fallback SNe. This may carry important consequences for our understanding of SNe, binary BH and NS systems, X-ray binary systems and gravitational wave transients. |

|| M. C. Baglio, et al. -- incl., <mark>F. Lewis</mark> |
|*Comments*| *18 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ*|
|**Abstract**| We report on a long-term optical monitoring of the neutron star X-ray binary Centaurus X-4 performed during the last 13.5 years. This source has been in quiescence since its outburst in 1979. Our monitoring reveals the overall evolution of the accretion disc; we detect short-duration flares, likely originating also in the disc, superimposed with a small-amplitude (< 0.1 mag) ellipsoidal modulation from the companion star due to geometrical effects. A long-term (~2300 days) downward trend, followed by a shorter (~1000 days) upward one, is observed in the disc light curve. Such a rise in the optical has been observed for other X-ray binaries preceding outbursts, as predicted by the disc instability model. For Cen X-4, the rise of the optical flux proceeded for ~3 years, and culminated in a flux increase at all wavelengths (optical-UV-X-rays) at the end of 2020. This increase faded after ~2 weeks, without giving rise to a full outburst. We suggest that the propagation of an inside-out heating front was ignited due to a partial ionization of hydrogen in the inner disc. The propagation might have stalled soon after the ignition due to the increasing surface density in the disc that the front encountered while propagating outwards. The stall was likely eased by the low level irradiation of the outer regions of the large accretion disc, as shown by the slope of the optical/X-ray correlation, suggesting that irradiation does not play a strong role in the optical, compared to other sources of emission. |

|| L. Vleeschower, et al. -- incl., <mark>M. Kramer</mark>, <mark>J. W. T. Hessels</mark> |
|*Comments*| *14 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables. Accepted for publication in MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**| Using the MeerKAT radio telescope, a series of observations have been conducted to time the known pulsars and search for new pulsars in the globular cluster NGC 6440. As a result, two pulsars have been discovered, NGC 6440G and NGC 6440H, one of which is isolated and the other a non-eclipsing (at frequencies above 962 MHz) "Black Widow", with a very low mass companion (M$_{\rm c}$ > 0.006 M$_{\odot}$). It joins the other binary pulsars discovered so far in this cluster which all have low companion masses (M$_{\rm c}$ < 0.30 M$_{\odot}$). We present the results of long-term timing solutions obtained using data from both Green Bank and MeerKAT telescopes for these two new pulsars and an analysis of the pulsars NGC 6440C and NGC 6440D. For the isolated pulsar NGC 6440C, we searched for planets using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. We find evidence for significant unmodelled variations but they cannot be well modelled as planets nor as part of a power-law red-noise process. Studies of the eclipses of the "Redback" pulsar NGC 6440D at two different frequency bands reveal a frequency dependence with longer and asymmetric eclipses at lower frequencies (962-1283 MHz). |

|| Denis González-Caniulef, Ilaria Caiazzo, <mark>Jeremy Heyl</mark> |
|*Comments*| *10 pages, 7 figures. Submitted to MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**| We present a systematic study of the unbinned likelihood technique, which can be used as an alternative method to analyse phase-dependent, X-ray spectro-polarimetric observations obtained with IXPE and other photo-electric polarimeters. We apply the unbinned technique to models of the luminous X-ray pulsar Hercules X-1, for which we produce simulated observations using IXPEObsSim package. We consider minimal knowledge about the actual physical process responsible for the polarized emission from the accreting pulsar and assume that the observed phase-dependent polarization angle can be described by the rotating vector model. Using the unbinned technique, the detector's modulation factor, and the polarization information alone, we found that both the rotating vector model and the underlying spectro-polarimetry model can reconstruct equally well the geometric configuration angles of the accreting pulsar. However, the measured polarization fraction becomes biased with respect to underlying model unless the energy redistribution and effective area of the detector are also taken into account. For the different analyses, we obtain posterior distributions from multiple IXPEObsSim realizations and show that the unbinned technique yields $\sim 10\%$ smaller error bars than the binned technique. We also discuss alternative sources, such as magnetars, in which the unbinned technique and the rotating vector model might be applied. |

|| <mark>J. Coronado-Blazquez</mark>, M. Sanchez-Conde, J. Perez-Romero, A. Aguirre-Santaella |
|*Comments*| *21 pages, 17 figures, 3 tables. Matches the PRD accepted version*|
|**Abstract**| Spatial extension has been hailed as a "smoking gun" in the gamma-ray search of dark galactic subhalos, which would appear as unidentified sources for gamma-ray telescopes. In this work, we study the sensitivity of the Fermi-LAT to extended subhalos using simulated data based on a realistic sky model. We simulate spatial templates for a set of representative subhalos, whose parameters were derived from our previous work with N-body cosmological simulation data. We find that detecting an extended subhalo and finding an unequivocal signal of angular extension requires, respectively, a flux 2 to 10 times larger than in the case of a point-like source. By studying a large grid of models, where parameters such as the WIMP mass, annihilation channel or subhalo model are varied significantly, we obtain the response of the LAT as a function of the product of annihilation cross section times the J-factor. Indeed, we show that spatial extension can be used as an additional filter to reject subhalos candidates among the pool of unidentified LAT sources, as well as a "smoking gun" for positive identification. For instance, typical angular extensions of a few tenths of degree are expected for the considered scenarios. Finally, we also study the impact of the obtained LAT sensitivity to such extended subhalos on the achievable dark matter constraints, which are a few times less constraining than comparable point-source limits. |

|| Evangelia Samara, et al. -- incl., <mark>Stephan G. Heinemann</mark> |
|*Comments*| *Accepted by the Astronomy & Astrophysics journal*|
|**Abstract**| It has long been known that the high-speed stream (HSS) peak velocity at Earth directly depends on the area of the coronal hole (CH) on the Sun. Different degrees of association between the two parameters have been shown by many authors. In this study, we revisit this association in greater detail for a sample of 45 nonpolar CHs during the minimum phase of solar cycle 24. The aim is to understand how CHs of different properties influence the HSS peak speeds observed at Earth and draw from this to improve solar wind modeling. The characteristics of the CHs of our sample were extracted based on the Collection of Analysis Tools for Coronal Holes (CATCH) which employs an intensity threshold technique applied to extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) filtergrams. We first examined all the correlations between the geometric characteristics of the CHs and the HSS peak speed and duration at Earth, for the entire sample. The CHs were then categorized in different groups based on morphological criteria, such as the aspect ratio, the orientation angle and the geometric complexity, a parameter which is often neglected when the formation of the fast solar wind at Earth is studied. Our results, confirmed also by the bootstrapping technique, show that all three aforementioned morphological criteria play a major role in determining the HSS peak speed at 1 AU. Therefore, they need to be taken into consideration for empirical models that aim to forecast the fast solar wind at Earth based on the observed CH solar sources. |

|| <mark>Javier Hernando-Ayuso</mark>, Claudio Bombardelli, Giulio Baù, Alicia Martínez-Cacho |
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**| The paper addresses the problem of minimizing the impact of non-linearities when dealing with uncertainty propagation in the perturbed two-body problem. The recently introduced generalized equinoctial orbital element set (GEqOE) is employed as a means to reduce non-linear effects stemming from J$_2$ and higher order gravity field harmonics. The uncertainty propagation performance of the proposed set of elements in different Earth orbit scenarios, including low-thrust orbit raising, is evaluated using a Cram\'er-von Mises test on the Mahalanobis distance of the uncertainty distribution. A considerable improvement compared to all sets of elements proposed so far is obtained. |

|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics. Figures have been converted to PNG and are of lower quality than in the version accepted. Three tables in the appendices will be published electronically; only table C1 is given here. 25 pages (including appendices),23 figures*|
|**Abstract**| (Abridged) We have used Gaia EDR3 data, together with spectra of a large sample of luminous stars in the field surrounding Westerlund 1, to explore the extent of the cluster. We carry out a non-parametric analysis of proper motions and membership determination. We investigate the reddening and proper motions of several dozen OB stars and red supergiants < 1 deg away from Wd 1. We identify a population of kinematic members of Wd 1 that largely includes the known spectroscopic members. From their EDR3 parallaxes, we derive a distance to the cluster of $4.23^{+0.23}_{-0.21}$kpc. Extinction in this direction increases by a large amount around 2.8 kpc, due to dark clouds associated to the Scutum-Crux arm. As a consequence, we hardly see any stars at distances comparable to that of the cluster. The proper motions of Wd 1, however, are very similar to those of stars in the field surrounding it, but distinct. We find a second, astrometrically well-defined population in the foreground ($d\approx2\:$kpc), likely connected to the possible open cluster BH197. Wd 1 is very elongated, an effect not driven by the very heavy extinction to the East and South. We find a low-density halo extending up to 10' from the cluster centre, mainly in the NW quadrant. A few OB stars at larger distances from the cluster, most notably the LBV MN48, share its proper motions, suggesting that Wd 1 has little or no peculiar motion with respect to the field population of the Norma arm. However, we are unable to find any red supergiant that could belong to an extended population related to the cluster, although we observe several dozen such objects in the foreground. We find a substantial population of luminous OB members obscured by several more magnitudes of extinction than most known members. These objects, mostly located in the central region of the cluster, increase the population of OB supergiants by about 25%. |

|| Jessi Cisewski-Kehe, et al. -- incl., <mark>Wojciech Hellwing</mark> |
|*Comments*| *17 pages, 11 figures*|
|**Abstract**| The spatial distribution of galaxies at sufficiently small scales will encode information about the identity of the dark matter. We develop a novel description of the halo distribution using persistent homology summaries, in which collections of points are decomposed into clusters, loops and voids. We apply these methods, together with a set of hypothesis tests, to dark matter haloes in MW-analog environment regions of the cold dark matter (CDM) and warm dark matter (WDM) Copernicus Complexio $N$-body cosmological simulations. The results of the hypothesis tests find statistically significant differences (p-values $\leq$ 0.001) between the CDM and WDM structures, and the functional summaries of persistence diagrams detect differences at scales that are distinct from the comparison spatial point process functional summaries considered (including the two-point correlation function). The differences between the models are driven most strongly at filtration scales $\sim100$~kpc, where CDM generates larger numbers of unconnected halo clusters while WDM instead generates loops. This study was conducted on dark matter haloes generally; future work will involve applying the same methods to realistic galaxy catalogues. |

|| Beomdu Lim, et al. -- incl., <mark>Jinhee Lee</mark>, <mark>Jeong-Eun Lee</mark> |
|*Comments*| *18 pages, 16 figures, accepted for publication in AJ*|
|**Abstract**| Stellar kinematics provides the key to understanding star formation process. In this respect, we present a kinematic study of the Monoceros OB1 (Mon OB1) and R1 (Mon R1) associations using the recent Gaia data and radial velocities of stars derived from high-resolution spectroscopy and the literature. A total of 728 members are selected using the criteria based on the intrinsic properties of young stars, parallaxes, and proper motions. The spatial distribution and kinematic properties of members show that these associations have distinct substructures. In Mon OB1, we find one northern group and two southern groups. Mon R1 is composed of three small stellar groups that are spatially and kinematically distinct. Some stars are found in a halo around these two associations. We detect patterns of expansion for most stellar groups in the associations. In addition, two stellar groups in Mon OB1 show the signature of rotation, which provides an important constraint on cluster formation. The star formation history of Mon OB1 is slightly revised. Star formation first occurred in the southern region and subsequently in the northern region. Recent star-forming events ignited deeper into the southern region, while some stars are escaping from Mon OB1, forming a halo. Mon R1 might have formed at the same epoch as the formation of the northern group in Mon OB1. Given that star formation is taking place on different scales along a large arc-like structure, Mon OB1 and Mon R1 may be the results of hierarchical star formation. |

|| Giulio Lucchetta, et al. -- incl., <mark>Hermann Kolanoski</mark>, <mark>Wolfgang Lange</mark> |
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**| We report spectral and imaging performance of a pixelated CdZnTe detector custom designed for the \emph{MeVCube} project: a small Compton telescope on a CubeSat platform. \emph{MeVCube} is expected to cover the energy range between $200\;\mathrm{keV}$ and $4\;\mathrm{MeV}$, with performance comparable to the last generation of larger satellites. In order to achieve this goal, an energy resolution of few percent in full width at half maximum (FWHM) and a $3$-D spatial resolution of few millimeters for the individual detectors are needed. The severe power constraints present in small satellites require very low power read-out electronics for the detector. Our read-out is based on the VATA450.3 ASIC developed by \emph{Ideas}, with a power consumption of only $0.25\;\mathrm{mW/channel}$, which exhibits good performance in terms of dynamic range, noise and linearity. A $2.0\;\mathrm{cm} \times 2.0\;\mathrm{cm} \times 1.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ CdZnTe detector, with a custom $8 \times 8$ pixel anode structure read-out by a VATA450.3 ASIC, has been tested. A preliminary read-out system for the cathode, based on a discrete \emph{Amptek} A250F charge sensitive pre-amplifier and a DRS4 ASIC, has been implemented. An energy resolution around $3\%$ FWHM has been measured at a gamma energy of $662\;\mathrm{keV}$; at $200\;\mathrm{keV}$ the average energy resolution is $6.5\%$, decreasing to $\lesssim 2\%$ at energies above $1\;\mathrm{MeV}$. A $3$-D spatial resolution of $\approx 2\,\mathrm{mm}$ is achieved. |

|| Jannis Necker, et al. -- incl., <mark>Thomas de Jaeger</mark>, <mark>Kyle Neumann</mark> |
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**| We report on the search for optical counterparts to IceCube neutrino alerts released between April 2016 and August 2021 with the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN). Despite the discovery of a diffuse astrophysical high-energy neutrino flux in 2013, the source of those neutrinos remains largely unknown. Since 2016, IceCube has published likely-astrophysical neutrinos as public realtime alerts. Through a combination of normal survey and triggered target-of-opportunity observations, ASAS-SN obtained images within 1 hour of the neutrino detection for 20% (11) of all observable IceCube alerts and within one day for another 57% (32). For all observable alerts, we obtained images within at least two weeks from the neutrino alert. ASAS-SN provides the only optical follow-up for about 17% of IceCube's neutrino alerts. We recover the two previously claimed counterparts to neutrino alerts, the flaring-blazar TXS 0506+056 and the tidal disruption event AT2019dsg. We investigate the light curves of previously-detected transients in the alert footprints, but do not identify any further candidate neutrino sources. We also analysed the optical light curves of Fermi 4FGL sources coincident with high-energy neutrino alerts, but do not identify any contemporaneous flaring activity. Finally, we derive constraints on the luminosity functions of neutrino sources for a range of assumed evolution models. |

|| <mark>Liang Zhang</mark>, Ruisheng Zheng, Huadong Chen, Yao Chen |
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**| Solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) waves are large-scale propagating disturbances in the corona. It is generally believed that the vital key for the formation of EUV waves is the rapid expansion of the loops that overlie erupting cores in solar eruptions, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar jets. However, the details of the interaction between the erupting cores and overlying loops are not clear, because that the overlying loops are always instantly opened after the energetic eruptions. Here, we present three typical jet-driven EUV waves without CME to study the interaction between the jets and the overlying loops that remained closed during the events. All three jets emanated from magnetic flux cancelation sites in source regions. Interestingly, after the interactions between jets and overlying loops, three EUV waves respectively formed ahead of the top, the near end (close to the jet source), and the far (another) end of the overlying loops. According to the magnetic field distribution of the loops extrapolated from Potential Field Source Surface method, it is confirmed that the birth places of three jet-driven EUV waves were around the weakest magnetic field strength part of the overlying loops. We suggest that the jet-driven EUV waves preferentially occur at the weakest part of the overlying loops, and the location can be subject to the magnetic field intensity around the ends of the loops. |

|**Abstract**| This is the sixth paper presenting the results of the MUse RAdio Loud Emission line Snapshot survey (MURALES). We observed 37 radio sources from the 3C sample with z<0.3 and declination <20 degrees with the MUSE optical integral field spectrograph at the VLT. We here focus on the properties of the extended emission line regions (EELRs) that can be studied with unprecedented detail thanks to the depth of these observations. Line emission in the 10 FRIs is, in most cases, confined to within <4 kpc, while large-scale (>4 kpc) ionized gas is seen in all but two of the 26 FRIIs. It usually takes the form of elongated or filamentary structures, typically extending between 10 and 30 kpc, but also reaching distances of ~80 kpc. We find that 1) the large-scale ionized gas structures show a tendency to be oriented at large angles from the radio axis, and 2) the gas on a scale of a few kpc from the nucleus often shows ordered rotation with a kinematical axis forming a median angle of 65 degrees with the radio axis. We also discuss the velocity field and ionization properties of the EELRs. The observed emission line structures appear to be associated with gaseous "superdisks" formed after a gas rich merger. The different properties of the EELR can be explained with a combination of the source evolutionary state and the orientation of the "superdisk" with respect to the radio axis. The general alignment between the superdisks and radio axis might be produced by stable and coherent accretion maintained over long timescales. |
