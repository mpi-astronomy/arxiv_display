|**Abstract**|            We report the discovery of NGTS-11 c, a transiting warm Neptune ($P \approx 12.8$ d; $M_{p} = 1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2} M_{\mathrm{Nep}}$; $R_{p} = 1.24 \pm 0.03 R_{\mathrm{Nep}}$), in an orbit interior to the previously reported transiting warm Saturn NGTS-11 b ($P \approx 35.5$ d). We also find evidence of a third outer companion orbiting the K-dwarf NGTS-11. We first detected transits of NGTS-11 c in TESS light curves and confirmed them with follow-up transits from NGTS and many other ground-based facilities. Radial-velocity monitoring with the HARPS and FEROS spectrographs revealed the mass of NGTS-11 c and provides evidence for a long-period companion ($P > 2300$ d; $M_{p} \sin i > 3.6 M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$). Taking into account the two additional bodies in our expanded datasets, we find that the mass of NGTS-11 b ($M_{p} = 0.63 \pm 0.09 M_{\mathrm{Sat}}$; $R_{p} = 0.97 \pm 0.02 R_{\mathrm{Sat}}$) is lower than previously reported ($M_{p} = 1.2 \pm 0.3 M_{\mathrm{Sat}}$). Given their near-circular and compact orbits, NGTS-11 c and b are unlikely to have reached their present locations via high-eccentricity migration. Instead, they probably either formed in situ or formed farther out and then underwent disk migration. A comparison of NGTS-11 with the eight other known systems hosting multiple well-characterized warm giants shows that it is most similar to Kepler-56. Finally, we find that the commonly used 10-day boundary between hot and warm Jupiters is empirically well supported.         |

|**Abstract**|            JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy enables dynamical mass measurements for typical star-forming galaxies only a billion years after the Big Bang. We model the H$\alpha$ morpho-kinematics of 163 galaxies at redshift $z\approx4$-6 from FRESCO and CONGRESS (with JADES imaging), using the $\texttt{geko}$ code, and infer rotational velocities and dispersions within $r_{\rm e}$. Our sample spans $\log M_{\star}\approx7$-10 and $\log M_{\rm dyn}\approx9$-11. Gas masses are estimated via scaling relations, yielding baryonic masses and dark-matter (DM) fractions $f_{\rm DM}(r<r_{\rm e})$ within the H$\alpha$ half-light radius. We find high median fractions of $\langle f_{\rm gas}\rangle=0.77$ and $\langle f_{\rm DM}\rangle=0.73$, where $f_{\rm gas}$ is measured with respect to the baryonic mass and $f_{\rm DM}$ with respect to the DM+baryonic mass. About two-thirds of systems are DM-dominated within $r_{\rm e}\sim0.5-1$ kpc. Both $f_{\rm gas}$ and $f_{\rm DM}$ decrease with stellar mass, consistent with simulations. The stellar Tully-Fisher relation shows a tentative offset to higher $v_{\rm circ}$ at fixed $M_{\star}$ and substantial intrinsic scatter, suggesting that the relation is only beginning to emerge at $z\sim5$. We measure a negative correlation between $f_{\rm DM}$ and baryonic surface density $\Sigma_{\rm bar}$, weaker but broadly consistent with trends at cosmic noon and at $z\sim0$. Qualitatively comparing with modified NFW profiles coupled to an empirical stellar-to-halo mass relation suggests that the lowest $f_{\rm DM}$ ($\lesssim0.4$) require cored inner DM profiles, while the highest fractions favour cuspier profiles, potentially reflecting adiabatic contraction. Overall, the elevated $f_{\rm gas}$ and $f_{\rm DM}$ at $z\gtrsim4$ are compatible with progenitors of baryon-dominated systems at $z\sim2$ and naturally anticipate overmassive black holes at fixed $M_{\star}$.         |

|| Y. Zhou, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-17*|

|**Abstract**|            We present the $z=0$ results for the cosmological simulation ASTRID. Hosting $2\times 5500^3\approx$ 0.33 trillion particles in a box of $370\, {\rm Mpc}$ per side, ASTRID is one of the largest cosmological hydrodynamic simulations evolved to $z=0$. ASTRID features a large population of massive black holes (MBHs), covering a wide mass range $4\times10^{4}\sim 2\times 10^{11}\ M_{\odot}$. The adopted dynamical friction model provides a relatively accurate description of MBH dynamics, making ASTRID a powerful tool to study MBH growth and mergers in a cosmological context. ASTRID successfully captures the co-evolution of MBHs and their host galaxies, producing $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\star}$ and $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ relations in good agreement with observations. Notably, ASTRID generates scatter in these relations that is more consistent with observations than previous simulations, indicating a more realistic MBH diversity. The galaxy stellar mass function at $z=0$ is generally consistent with observational constraints. When dust attenuation is applied, the galaxy luminosity function also agrees well with observations, and the bimodality in galaxy colors is reproduced as well. ASTRID hosts a large population of massive galaxy groups and clusters: 7 halos have $M_{\rm 200c}>10^{15}\ M_{\odot}$, and 9709 halos have $M_{\rm 200c}>10^{13}\ M_{\odot}$. We quantify the stellar mass content in these halos, and find that the correlations between the stellar and halo mass match well with observational constraints. Finally, we present the $z=0$ power spectra of MBH and galaxies, as well as their bias with respect to the matter power spectrum. We find that MBHs with $M_{\rm BH}\geq 10^{8}\ M_{\odot}$ and galaxies with $M_{\star}\geq 10^{10.5}\ M_{\odot}$ serve as good tracers of large-scale structure.         |

|**Abstract**|            Accreting supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies are the engine of active galactic nuclei (AGN). X-ray light curves of unabsorbed AGN show dramatic random variability on timescales ranging from seconds to years. The power spectrum of the fluctuations is usually well-modelled with a power law that decays as $1/f$ at low frequencies, and which bends to $1/f^{2-3}$ at high frequencies. The timescale associated with the bend correlates well with the mass of the black hole and may also correlate with bolometric luminosity in the `X-ray variability plane'. Because AGN light curves are usually irregularly sampled, the estimation of AGN power spectra is challenging. In a previous paper, we introduced a new method to estimate the parameters of bending power law power spectra from AGN light curves. We apply this method to a sample of 56 variable and unabsorbed AGN, observed with XMM-Newton and Swift in the $0.3-1.5$ keV band over the past two decades. We obtain estimates of the bends in 50 sources, which is the largest sample of X-ray bends in the soft band. We also find that the high-frequency power spectrum is often steeper than 2. We update the X-ray variability plane with new bend timescale measurements spanning from 7 min to 62 days. We report the detections of low-frequency bends in the power spectra of five AGN, three of which are previously unpublished: 1H 1934-063, Mkn 766 and Mkn 279.         |

|**Abstract**|            Infrared time-domain surveys remain significantly underdeveloped compared with their optical counterparts. We have developed the Antarctic Infrared Binocular Telescope (AIRBT) to study the dynamic infrared sky at Dome A, Antarctica, taking advantage of the superb infrared observational conditions at this site. AIRBT consists of two identical 15 cm f/3 optical tube assemblies and two cost-effective indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) cameras equipped with J and H filters, respectively. The cameras have 640 x 512 pixels with a size of 15 micrometers, providing a scale of 6.9 arcseconds per pixel and a field of view of 1.22 x 0.97 square degrees. We characterize the performance of the InGaAs cameras, including bias, readout noise, dark current, nonlinearity, and photon transfer curve. Our analysis highlights the distinct behaviors of InGaAs cameras compared with charge-coupled devices (CCDs). The bias and readout noise show temperature dependence, and the noise measured from the photon transfer curves has additional components that increase with exposure time. On-sky tests were conducted in October 2022 including system calibration, limiting depth, and photometric precision. For a single 3-second exposure, we achieved 5-sigma limiting magnitudes of 11.2 mag (Vega system) in J band and 9.7 mag in H band. The best photometric precision reached 20 millimagnitudes at the bright end, which could be further improved to sub-percent levels through image stacking. AIRBT was installed at Dome A in January 2023, and scientific observations began as soon as darkness set in.         |

|| <mark>M. Zhang</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-17*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted by MNRAS, 18 pages, 12 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            Dust plays a critical role in the study of the interstellar medium (ISM). Extinction maps derived from optical surveys often fail to capture regions with high column density due to the limited photometric depth in optical wavelengths. To address these limitations, we developed the XPNICER method based on near-infrared (NIR) photometric survey data. This method combines the previously established PNICER and Xpercentile techniques, enabling effective mitigation of foreground contamination and improved handling of complex dust structures in the Galactic plane, which thus can provide more accurate extinction estimates, particularly in highly obscured regions. By applying XPNICER to the Galactic Plane Survey from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey, we have generated a series of two-dimensional (2D) dust extinction maps that span roughly 1800 deg2 of the Galactic plane (0< l < 110deg and 140< l < 232deg, |b| < 5deg). These maps, with spatial resolutions between 30arcsec and 300arcsec, can trace extinction up to Av ~ 30-40 mag. This new approach offers higher spatial resolution and better detection of high-extinction regions compared to previous large-scale dust-based maps of the Galactic plane, providing an independent and complementary measure of dust column densities.         |
