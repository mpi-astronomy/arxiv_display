|**Abstract**|            Recent studies of gas kinematics at high redshift have reported disky systems which appear to challenge models of galaxy formation, but it is unclear whether they are representative of the underlying galaxy population. We present the first statistical sample of spatially resolved ionised gas kinematics at high redshift, comprised of $272$ H$\alpha$ emitters in GOODS-S and GOODS-N at redshifts $z\approx3.9-6.5$, observed with JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and imaging from JADES, FRESCO and CONGRESS. The sample probes two orders of magnitude in stellar mass ($\log (M_{\star}[\mathrm{M}_{\odot}])\approx8-10$) and star formation rate ($\text{SFR}\approx0.3-100\thinspace M_{\odot}/$yr), and is representative down to $\log(M_{\star}[\mathrm{M}_{\odot}])\approx 9$. Using a novel inference tool, $\texttt{geko}$, we model the grism data to measure morphological and kinematic properties of the ionised gas, as probed by H$\alpha$. Our results are consistent with a decrease of the rotational support $v/\sigma_0$\ and increase of the velocity dispersion $\sigma_0$ with redshift, with $\sigma_0\approx100$ km/s and $v/\sigma_0\approx1-2$ at $z\approx3.9-6.5$. We study the relations between $\sigma_0$, and $v/\sigma_0$, and different star formation tracers and find a large scatter and diversity, with the strongest correlations between $\sigma_0$ and SFR and SFR surface density. The fraction of rotationally supported systems ($v/\sigma_0>1$) slightly increases with cosmic time, from $(36\pm6)\%$ to $(41\pm6)\%$ from $z\sim 5.5$ to $z\sim 4.5$, for galaxies with masses $9<\log(M_{\star}[\mathrm{M}_{\odot}])<10$. Overall, disks do not dominate the turbulent high-redshift galaxy population in the mass range probed by this work. When placed in the context of studies up to cosmic noon, our results are consistent with a significant increase of disk-like systems with cosmic time.         |

|**Abstract**|            Early B-type stars ($M_i=8-15$ M$_\odot$) are frequently in multiple systems, as evidenced by spectroscopic campaigns in the Milky Way (MW) and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Previous studies have shown no strong metallicity dependence in the close-binary (a>10 au) fraction or orbital-period distributions between the MW's solar metallicity (Z$_\odot$) and that of the LMC (Z=0.5 Z$_\odot$). However, similar analyses in more metal-poor environments are still scarce. We focus on 309 early B-type stars (luminosity classes III-V) from the Binarity at LOw Metallicity campaign in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC, Z=0.2 Z$_\odot$) using VLT/FLAMES multi-epoch spectroscopy. By applying binary detection criteria consistent with previous works, we identify 153 stars (91 SB1, 59 SB2, 3 SB3) exhibiting significant radial-velocity (RV) variations, resulting in an observed multiplicity fraction of $f^{obs}_{mult}=50\pm3\%$. Using Monte Carlo simulations to account for observational biases, we infer an intrinsic close-binary fraction of $f_{mult}=80\pm8\%$. A Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of the peak-to-peak RV distribution ($\Delta{\rm RV}_{\rm max}$) confirms a high multiplicity fraction of $f_{mult}=78\pm5\%$. These findings suggest a possible anti-correlation between metallicity and the fraction of close B-type binaries, with the SMC multiplicity fraction significantly exceeding previous measurements in the LMC and MW. The enhanced fraction of close binaries at SMC's low metallicity may have broad implications for massive-star evolution in the early Universe. More frequent mass transfer and envelope stripping could boost the production of exotic transients, stripped supernovae, gravitational-wave progenitors, and sustained UV ionising flux, potentially affecting cosmic reionisation. Theoretical predictions of binary evolution under metal-poor conditions will provide a key test of our results.         |

|| M. Žerjal, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. Jahnke</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-03-31*|
|*Comments*| *17 pages, 14 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            We present a catalogue of more than 5000 new ultracool dwarf (UCD) candidates in the three Euclid Deep Fields in the Q1 data release. They range from late M to late T dwarfs, and include 1200 L and T dwarfs. More than 100 of them have been spectroscopically confirmed, with seven of them being T dwarfs. Our UCD selection criteria are based only on colour ($I_\mathrm{E}-Y_\mathrm{E}>2.5$). The combined requirement for optical detection and stringent signal-to-noise ratio threshold ensure a high purity of the sample, but at the expense of completeness, especially for T dwarfs. The detections range from magnitudes 19 and 24 in the near-infrared bands, and extend down to 26 in the optical band. The average surface density of detected UCDs on the sky is approximately 100 objects per $\mathrm{deg}^2$, including 20 L and T dwarfs per $\mathrm{deg}^2$. This leads to an expectation of at least 1.4 million ultracool dwarfs in the final data release of the Euclid Wide Survey, including at least 300,000 L dwarfs, and more than 2,600 T dwarfs, using the strict selection criteria from this work. We provide empirical Euclid colours as a function of spectral type, and a probability that an object with a given colour has a certain spectral type.         |

|**Abstract**|            Ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) encompass the lowest mass stars and brown dwarfs, defining the stellar substellar boundary. They have significant potential for advancing the understanding of substellar physics; however, these objects are challenging to detect due to their low luminosity. The wide coverage and deep sensitivity of the Euclid survey will increase the number of confirmed and well characterised UCDs by several orders of magnitude. In this study, we take advantage of the Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) and in particular we look in detail at the known and new UCDs in the Euclid Deep Field North (22.9 deg2 down to JE = 24.5 mag), to understand the advantages of using the slitless Euclid spectroscopy. We compile a comparison sample of known UCDs and use their spectra to demonstrate the capability of Euclid to derive spectral types using a template matching method. This method is then applied to the spectra of the newly identified candidates. We confirm that 33 of these candidates are new UCDs, with spectral types ranging from M7 to T1 and JE = 17 to 21 mag. We look at their locus in colour colour diagrams and compare them with the expected colours of QSOs. A machine readable catalogue is provided for further study, containing both the comparison sample and the newly identified UCDs, along with their spectral classifications where the Q1 spectra quality allows for confident determination         |

|| M. E. Steinrueck, et al. -- incl., <mark>L. Kreidberg</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-03-31*|
|*Comments*| *resubmitted to ApJ after addressing referee report*|
|**Abstract**|            Measuring the atmospheric composition of hazy sub-Neptunes like GJ~1214b through transmission spectroscopy is difficult because of the degeneracy between mean molecular weight and haziness. It has been proposed that phase curve observations can break this degeneracy because of the relationship between mean molecular weight (MMW) and phase curve amplitude. However, photochemical hazes can strongly affect phase curve amplitudes as well. We present a large set of GCM simulations of the sub-Neptune GJ~1214b that include photochemical hazes with varying atmospheric composition, haze opacity and haze optical properties. In our simulations, photochemical hazes cause temperature changes of up to 200~K, producing thermal inversions and cooling deeper regions. This results in increased phase curve amplitudes and adds a considerable scatter to the phase curve amplitude--metallicity relationship. However, we find that if the haze production rate is high enough to significantly alter the phase curve, the secondary eclipse spectrum will exhibit either emission features or strongly muted absorption features. Thus, the combination of a white-light phase curve and a secondary eclipse spectrum can successfully distinguish between a hazy, lower MMW and a clear, high MMW scenario.         |

|| M. Ban, et al. |

|*Comments*| *10 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables. Accepted by A&A*|
|**Abstract**|            We report the analysis of a planetary microlensing event AT2021uey. The event was observed outside the Galactic bulge and was alerted by both space- (Gaia) and ground-based (ZTF and ASAS-SN) surveys. From the observed data, we find that the lens system is located at a distance of 1 kpc and comprises an M-dwarf host star of about half a solar mass, orbited by a Jupiter-like planet beyond the snowline. The source star could be a metal-poor giant located in the halo according to the spectral analyses and modelling. Hence, AT2021uey is a unique example of the binary-lens event outside the bulge that is offered by a disc-halo lens-source combination.         |

|| Q. Xiong, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-03-31*|
|*Comments*| *18 pages, 9 figures in the main text, 2 figures in the appendix*|
|**Abstract**|            Long-period variables (LPVs) are high-luminosity red giants or supergiants with pulsation periods ranging from days to years. Many LPVs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Galactic Bulge (BLG) have been continuously observed over a time span of 26 years by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. Using OGLE-IV data, we applied Gaussian Processes with kernels tailored for solar-like oscillations to extract two global asteroseismic parameters: the frequency of maximum power (numax) and the large frequency separation (Dnu), for LPVs with primary mode periods (P1) between 10 and 100 days in the LMC and BLG. We found that the numax-Dnu relation for LPVs in this work aligns with that of lower-luminosity Kepler red giants, confirming that the pulsations of these LPVs are likely solar-like. We found that numax and Dnu can serve as luminosity indicators. Compared to P1, numax and Dnu exhibit significantly tighter correlations with the absolute magnitude in the 2MASS K_s band (M_{K}), with corresponding scatter of 0.27 mag and 0.21 mag, respectively. Using the calibrated numax-mk and Dnu-mk relations for LPVs in the LMC, we determined the M_{K} values for individual stars in the BLG. By accounting for extinction, we further calculated the distances to 4,948 BLG stars. The peak of the resulting distance distribution corresponds to an estimated distance to the Galactic center of approximately 9.1 kpc, which appears to be overestimated, suggesting that the seismic luminosity relation calibrated from the LMC may not be directly applicable to BLG stars.         |

|| <mark>J. Liu</mark>, Y. Zhao, K.-X. Lu, J.-M. Bai |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-03-31*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            In this paper we present a comprehensive study on the properties of the interstellar medium in NGC~1222, a star-forming early-type merging galaxy that forms a triple system, using optical and far-infrared (FIR) spectroscopic, and multiband photometric data. The fit to the spectral energy distribution reveals a high dust content in the galaxy, with a dust-to-stellar mass ratio of $M_\mathrm{dust}/M_\star\sim3.3\times10^{-3}$ that is 40$-$90 larger than the mean value of local S0 galaxies. By comparing the observed optical emission line ratios to shock models, we suggest that a merger-induced shock, which is further supported by the higher-than-average \OI- and \CII-to-PAH ratios, plays a role in heating the gas in NGC~1222. We also show evidence for gas inflow by analysing the kinematic properties of NGC~1222.         |
