|**Abstract**| We report the identification of 64 new candidates of compact galaxies, potentially hosting faint quasars with bolometric luminosities of $L_\mathrm{bol} = 10^{43}$--10$^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$, residing in the reionization epoch within the redshift range of $6 \lesssim z \lesssim 8$. These candidates were selected by harnessing the rich multiband datasets provided by the emerging JWST-driven extragalactic surveys, focusing on COSMOS-Web, as well as JADES, UNCOVER, CEERS, and PRIMER. Our search strategy includes two stages: applying stringent photometric cuts to catalog-level data and detailed spectral energy distribution fitting. These techniques effectively isolate the quasar candidates while mitigating contamination from low-redshift interlopers, such as brown dwarfs and nearby galaxies. The selected candidates indicate physical traits compatible with low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, likely hosting $\approx10^5$--$10^7~M_\odot$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs) living in galaxies with stellar masses of $\approx10^8$--$10^{10}~M_\odot$. The SMBHs selected in this study, on average, exhibit elevated mass compared to their hosts, with the mass ratio distribution slightly higher than those of galaxies in the local universe. As with other high-$z$ studies, this is at least in part due to the selection method for these quasars. An extensive Monte Carlo analysis provides compelling evidence that heavy black hole seeds from the direct collapse scenario appear to be the preferred pathway to mature this specific subset of SMBHs by $z\approx7$. This work underscores the significance of further spectroscopic observations, as the quasar candidates presented here offer exceptional opportunities to delve into the nature of the earliest galaxies and SMBHs formed during cosmic infancy. |

|**Abstract**| Based on all 2-minute cadence $TESS$ light curves from Sector 1 to 60, we provide a catalog of 8,651 solar-like oscillators, including frequency at maximum power ($\nu_{\rm max}$, with its median precision, $\sigma$=5.39\%), large frequency separation ($\Delta\nu$, $\sigma$=6.22\%), seismically derived masses, radii, and surface gravity. In this sample, we have detected 2,173 new oscillators and added 4,373 new $\Delta\nu$ measurements. Our seismic parameters are consistent with those from $Kepler$, $K2$, and previous $TESS$ data. The median fractional residual in $\nu_{\rm max}$ is $1.63\%$ with a scatter of $14.75\%$, and in $\Delta\nu$ it is $0.11\%$ with a scatter of $10.76\%$. We have detected 476 solar-like oscillators with $\nu_{\rm max}$ exceeding the $Nyquist$ frequency of $Kepler$ long-cadence data during the evolutionary phases of sub-giant and the base of the red-giant branch, which provide a valuable resource for understanding angular momentum transport. |

|| B. Huang, et al. -- incl., <mark>R. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-01-23*|
|*Comments*| *20 pages, 17 figures*|
|**Abstract**| By combining spectra from the CALSPEC and NGSL, as well as spectroscopic data from the LAMOST Data Release 7 (DR7), we have analyzed and corrected the systematic errors of the Gaia DR3 BP/RP (XP) spectra. The errors depend on the normalized spectral energy distribution (simplified by two independent ``colors'') and $G$ magnitude. Our corrections are applicable in the range of approximately $-0.5<BP-RP<2$, $3<G<17.5$ and $E(B-V)<0.8$. To validate our correction, we conduct independent tests by comparing with the MILES and LEMONY spectra. The results demonstrate that the systematic errors of $BP-RP$ and $G$ have been effectively corrected, especially in the near ultraviolet. The consistency between the corrected Gaia XP spectra and the MILES and LEMONY is better than 2 per cent in the wavelength range of $336-400$\,nm and 1 per cent in redder wavelengths. A global absolute calibration is also carried out by comparing the synthetic Gaia photometry from the corrected XP spectra with the corrected Gaia DR3 photometry. Our study opens up new possibilities for using XP spectra in many fields. A Python package is publicly available to do the corrections (https://doi.org/10.12149/101375 or https://github.com/HiromonGON/GaiaXPcorrection). |

|**Abstract**| We analyze the anomalies appearing in the light curves of the three microlensing events MOA-2022-BLG-563, KMT-2023-BLG-0469, and KMT-2023-BLG-0735. The anomalies exhibit common short-term dip features that appear near the peak. From the detailed analyses of the light curves, we find that the anomalies were produced by planets accompanied by the lenses of the events. For all three events, the estimated mass ratios between the planet and host are on the order of $10^{-4}$: $q\sim 8 \times 10^{-4}$ for MOA-2022-BLG-563L, $q\sim 2.5\times 10^{-4}$ for KMT-2023-BLG-0469L, and $q\sim 1.9\times 10^{-4}$ for KMT-2023-BLG-0735L. The interpretations of the anomalies are subject to a common inner-outer degeneracy, which causes ambiguity when estimating the projected planet-host separation. We estimated the planet mass, $M_{\rm p}$, host mass, $M_{\rm h}$, and distance, $D_{\rm L}$, to the planetary system by conducting Bayesian analyses using the observables of the events. The estimated physical parameters of the planetary systems are $(M_{\rm h}/M_\odot, M_{\rm p}/M_{\rm J}, D_{\rm L}/{\rm kpc}) = (0.48^{+0.36}_{-0.30}, 0.40^{+0.31}_{-0.25}, 6.53^{+1.12}_{-1.57})$ for MOA-2022-BLG-563L, $(0.47^{+0.35}_{-0.26}, 0.124^{+0.092}_{-0.067}, 7.07^{+1.03}_{-1.19})$ for KMT-2023-BLG-0469L, and $(0.62^{+0.34}_{-0.35}, 0.125^{+0.068}_{-0.070}, 6.26^{+1.27}_{-1.67})$ for KMT-2023-BLG-0735L. According to the estimated parameters, all planets are cold planets with projected separations that are greater than the snow lines of the planetary systems, they have masses that lie between the masses of Uranus and Jupiter of the Solar System, and the hosts of the planets are main-sequence stars that are less massive than the Sun. |
