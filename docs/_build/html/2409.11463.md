**Abstract:** $\noindent$ We present a new method to determine the star formation rate (SFR) density of the Universe at $z \gtrsim 5$ that includes the contribution of dust-obscured star formation. For this purpose, we use a [ CII ] (158 $\mu$ m) selected sample of galaxies serendipitously identified in the fields of known $z\gtrsim 4.5$ objects to characterize the fraction of obscured SFR. The advantage of a [ CII ] selection is that our sample is SFR-selected, in contrast to a UV-selection that would be biased towards unobscured star formation. We obtain a sample of 23 [ CII ] emitters near star-forming (SF) galaxies and QSOs -- three of which we identify for the first time -- using previous literature and archival ALMA data. 18 of these serendipitously identified galaxies have sufficiently deep rest-UV data and are used to characterize the obscured fraction of the star formation in galaxies with SFRs $\gtrsim 30 \text{M}_{\odot}   \text{yr}^{-1}$ . We find that [ CII ] emitters identified around SF galaxies have $\approx$ 63 \% of their SFR obscured, while [ CII ] emitters around QSOs have $\approx$ 93 \% of their SFR obscured. By forward modeling existing wide-area UV luminosity function (LF) determinations, we derive the intrinsic UV LF using our characterization of the obscured SFR. Integrating the intrinsic LF to $M_{UV}$ = $-$ 20 we find that the obscured SFRD contributes to $>3\%$ and $>10\%$ of the total SFRD at $z \sim 5$ and $z \sim 6$ based on our sample of companions galaxies near SFGs and QSOs, respectively. Our results suggest that dust obscuration is not negligible at $z\gtrsim 5$ , further underlining the importance of far-IR observations of the $z\gtrsim 5$ Universe.

**Figure 8. -** The unobscured fraction of the SFR as a function of the total SFR as measured from the [CII] emission from companions galaxies around SF galaxies (_left_) and companions galaxies around QSOs (_right_). The [CII]-selected galaxies are shown in red and orange for these samples, respectively, and the mean unobscured fraction by the black solid line. The width of the shaded grey region indicates the 16th and 84th percentiles of the mean fraction. Galaxies that are not detected in the far-IR are indicated by an upside down triangle. The blue diamonds show the relation derived for the stacked UV-selected ALPINE galaxies \citep{bethermin2020}, while the purple crosses show the relation based on the stacked REBELS sample \citep{algera23}. The dotted lines show the $z \sim 5$ and $z \sim 6$ relations from \citet{mauerhofer} from the DELPHI semi-analytic model calibrated with ALPINE and REBELS galaxies. Also shown are the IRX-$M_{*}$  relations from ASPECS \citep{Bouwens2020},  A$^3$COSMOS \citep{fudamoto20} and ALPINE/REBELS \citep{bowler23} assuming the main sequence relation from \citet{speagle14} for $z = 5$ and $z = 6$. The top axis shows the stellar masses assuming the same relation from \citet{speagle14} at $z = 5$ and $z = 6$. (*fig:obs*)

**Figure 11. -** Constraints on the SFR density as a function of redshift. _Top panel:_ The red and orange solid circles show the SFR density we estimate from our intrinsic UV luminosity functions based on dust obscuration from companions around SF galaxies and QSOs, respectively, integrated to $-17$ mag. We only infer the intrinsic LF and dust corrections over the SFR range directly sampled by our work and therefore the dust corrected SFRDs we derive are lower limits. The blue solid circles show the SFR density when we integrate the observed UV LF from \citet{Harikane2022} to $-17$ mag. The solid black line indicates the fiducial SFR density evolution from \citet{Madau2014}.  Meanwhile, the dashed/dotted lines correspond to the dust-rich and dust-poor models from \citet{casey2018brightest} and intrinsic and dust-attenuated models from \citet{mauerhofer}. Furthermore, we show the constraints on the rest-UV SFRD from \citet{bouwens2022}(_grey triangles_), the SFRD from radio-observations from \citet{Vlugt22}(_green triangles_) and SFRDs from the [CII]-LF from the ALPINE companions from \citet{Loiacona_alpine}(_aqua and purple crosses_).
    _Lower panel:_ The purple and green solid circles show the contribution of dust-obscured sources to the SFR density, based on the dust obscuration from SF galaxy and QSO companions, respectively. The empty purple and green circles show the dust-obscured SFRD when we assume a constant mean obscuration instead of using the distribution of obscured fractions. Other estimates of the contribution of obscured sources to the SFRD are shown, including those of \citet{Casey2021_MORA}(_light blue triangles_), \citet{Wang2019}(_orange pentagons_), \citet{Barrufet}(_gray thin diamond_), \citet{algera}(_yellow triangle_), \citet{fudamoto_nature}(_pink star_),  \citet{gruppioni2020}(_pink diamonds_),  \citet{Traina}(_aqua squares_), \citet{Khusanova_21}(_red cross and plus sign_), \citet{dud+20}(_green shaded region_) and \citet{vlugt23}(_orange shaded region_).

**Figure 1. -** The redshifts and [CII] luminosities of the 161 ALMA targets we use to search for a sample of [CII]-emitting companion galaxies.  The [CII] luminosity of the archival sources is derived based on the peak flux and the redshift is from the peak frequency of [CII]. The red circles correspond to the 27 quasars with [CII] detections where \citet{venemans_kilo} has already described a companion search, while the purple stars and blue diamonds correspond to the 25 [CII]-detected galaxies from REBELS \citep{rebels} and 75 [CII]-detected galaxies from ALPINE \citep{alpine}, where companion searches have been done (\citealt{fudamoto_nature,Loiacona_alpine}; see also Schouws et al. 2024, in prep.).
    Green squares indicate the 34 [CII]-detected ALMA targets where no searches for [CII]-emitting companion galaxies have thus far been reported in the literature, and we provide for the first time here.
    Filled markers indicate targeted galaxies with serendipitously detected companions, while open markers are targeted galaxies without detected companions. (*fig:parameter_space*)
