**Abstract:** About half of the mass of all heavy elements with mass number A $>$ 90 is formed through the slow neutron capture process (s-process), occurring in evolved asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with masses $\sim1-6$ $\msun$ . The s-process can be studied by modeling the accretion of material from AGB stars onto binary barium (Ba), CH, and carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP)-s stars. Comparing observationally derived surface parameters and 1D-LTE abundance patterns of s-process elements to theoretical binary accretion models, we aim to understand the formation of post-accretion systems. We explore the extent of dilution of the accreted material and describe the impact of convective mixing on the observed surface abundances. We compute a new grid of 2700 accretion models for low-mass post-accretion systems. A maximum-likelihood comparison determines the best fit models for observational samples of Ba, CH, and CEMP-s stars. We find consistent AGB donor masses in the mass range of $2 - 3$ $\msun$ $ $ across our sample of post-accretion binaries. We find the formation scenario for weak Ba stars is an AGB star transferring a moderate amount of mass ( $\leq 0.5$ $\msun$ ) resulting in a $\sim 2.0-2.5$ $\msun$ $ $ Ba star. The strong Ba stars are best fit with lower final masses $\sim1.0-2.0$ $\msun$ $ $ and significant accreted mass ( $\geq 0.5$ $\msun$ ). The CH and CEMP-s stars display lower final masses ( $\sim1.0$ $\msun$ ) and small amounts of transferred material ( $\sim 0.1$ $\msun$ ). We find that Ba stars generally accrete more material than CEMP-s and CH stars. We also find that strong Ba stars must accrete more than $0.50$ $\msun$ $ $ to explain their abundance patterns, and in this limit we are unable to reproduce the observed mass distribution of strong Ba stars. The mass distributions of the weak Ba stars, CEMP-s, and CH stars are well reproduced in our modeling.

**Figure 5. -** Left: Evolutionary tracks for a sample of stars with $m_{final} = 2.50$\msun$ $at [Fe/H] = -0.15 with different accretion masses and initial mass ratios, with accretion phases for each model highlighted in blue. Right: Relative surface abundance of the s-process element Ba. The abundance is elevated after the accretion phase, and only after the onset of first dredge-up and mixing is the surface abundance diluted. (*fig:acc_phase*)

Blue data points are strong Ba stars, cyan data points are weak Ba stars, orange data points are CH stars, and red data points are CEMP-s stars. Surface parameters and abundances are collected from \citet{Dimoff+2024}, \citet{DeCastro_etal2016}, \citet{Roriz2021}, \cite{Goswami_etal2006}, \citet{Karinkuzi_Goswami2014}, \citet{Karinkuzhi_Goswami2015}, \citet{Goswami_Aoki_Karinkuzhi2016}, \citet{Goswami+2021_CEMPs}.

**Figure 2. -** Example Kippenhahn diagram for a 2.00 $\msun$$ $star accreting 0.50 $\msun$$ $of material from a 2.50 $\msun$$ $AGB star at a metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.15. Green colors denote convective regions, and purple colors denote radiative regions, determined by the computed difference in the radiative and adiabatic transfer gradients. In the total mass on the y-axis, the accretion phase can be identified by the increase in mass. Note that the x-axis is model number, which is non-linear with respect to time. (*fig:Kippenhahn*)
