**Abstract:** Gaia18cjb is one of the Gaia-alerted eruptive young star candidates which has been experiencing a slow and strong brightening during the last 13 years, similar to some FU Orionis-type objects. The aim of this work is to derive the young stellar nature of Gaia18cjb, determine its physical and accretion properties to classify its variability. We conducted monitoring observations using multi-filter optical and near-infrared photometry, as well as near-infrared spectroscopy.We present the analysis of pre-outburst and outburst optical and infrared light curves, color-magnitude diagrams in different bands, the detection of near-IR spectral lines, and estimates of both stellar and accretion parameters during the burst. The optical light curve shows an unusually long (8 years) brightening event of 5 mag in the last 13 years, before reaching a plateau indicating that the burst is still on-going, suggesting a FUor-like nature.The same outburst is less strong in the infrared light curves.The near-infrared spectra, obtained during the outburst, exhibit emission lines typical of highly accreting low-intermediate mass young stars with typical EXor features.The spectral index of Gaia18cjb SED classifies it as a Class I in the pre-burst stage and a Flat Spectrum young stellar object (YSO) during the burst. Gaia18cjb is an eruptive YSO which shows FUor-like photometric features (in terms of brightening amplitude and length of the burst) and EXor-like spectroscopic features and accretion rate, as V350 Cep and V1647 Ori, classified as objects in between FUors and EXors.

**Figure 7. -** The visible (_ top_) and  infrared (_ bottom_) light curves of Gaia18cjb. The red circle highlights the Gaia Alert trigger. The error bars smaller than the symbol size are not presented. Grey dashed lines correspond to the epochs for which we collected NIR spectroscopy. (*fig:lightcurveVIS*)

**Figure 5. -** The background of the figure is the Planck 857 GHz map, 10 degrees in size, centred on Gaia18cjb, the red star symbol in the plot. Blue and orange dots are sources with H$\alpha$-excess from \citet{Fratta2021} whose distances are $0.95 {\rm pc} < d < 1.05 {\rm pc}$. The orange dots are sources whose proper motions are within 3 mas/yr from Gaia18cjb proper motions, see Figure \ref{fig:magnitudes}. The regions closes to Gaia18cjb are highlighted.
