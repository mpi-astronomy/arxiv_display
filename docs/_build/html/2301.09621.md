**Abstract:** We trace the evolution of the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 3501, making use of its stellar populations extracted from deep integral-field spectroscopy MUSE observations. We present stellar kinematic and population maps, as well as the star formation history, of the south-western half of the galaxy.The derived maps of the stellar line-of-sight velocity and velocity dispersion are quite regular, show disc-like rotation, and no other structural component of the galaxy.However, maps of the stellar populations exhibit structures in the mass-weighted and light-weighted age, total metallicity and [ Mg/Fe ] abundance.These maps indicate that NGC 3501 is a young galaxy, consisting mostly of stars with ages between 2 to 8 Gyr.Also, they show a thicker more extended structure that is metal-poor and $\alpha$ -rich, and another inner metal-rich and $\alpha$ -poor one with smaller radial extension.While previous studies revealed that NGC 3501 shows only one morphological disc component in its vertical structure, we divided the galaxy into two regions: an inner metal-rich midplane and a metal-poor thicker envelope.Comparing the star formation history of the inner thinner metal-rich disc and the thicker metal-poor disc,we see that the metal-rich component evolved more steadily, while the metal-poor one experienced several bursts of star formation.We propose this spiral galaxy is being observed in an early evolutionary phase, with a thicker disc already in place and an inner thin disc in an early formation stage. So we are probably witnessing the birth of a future massive thin disc, continuously growing embedded in a preexisting thicker disc. \

**Figure 8. -** Star formation history in terms of the mean mass fraction (normalized to the galaxy mass in the region covered by our data) in the metal-poor (bottom) and metal-rich (top) components as a function of age. Age bins are color-coded by metallicity [M/H](left), and by [Mg/Fe](right). Black dashed edges mark age bins with [Mg/Fe] abundances that we do not consider totally reliable, because of difficulties in retrieving the [$\alpha$/Fe] for young stars as discussed in Appendix \ref{appendix:system_unc}.
