**Abstract:** In this communication, we report on the results of the second phase of the $*Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge*$ started in 2019. This second phase focuses on the characterization of point sources (exoplanet signals) within multispectral high-contrast images from ground-based telescopes. We collected eight data sets from two high-contrast integral field spectrographs (namely Gemini-S/GPI and VLT/SPHERE-IFS) that we calibrated homogeneously and in which we injected a handful of synthetic planetary signals (ground truth) to be characterized by the data challenge participants.The tasks of the participants consist of (1) extracting the precise astrometry of each injected planetary signals, and (2) extracting the precise spectro-photometry of each injected planetary signal. Additionally, the participants may provide the 1-sigma uncertainties on their estimation for further analyses. When available, the participants can also provide the posterior distribution used to estimate the position/spectrum and uncertainties.The data are permanently available on a Zenodo repository and the participants can submit their results through the EvalAI platform.The EvalAI submission platform opened on April 2022 and closed on the 31st of May 2024.In total, we received $4$ valid submissions for the astrometry estimation and $4$ valid submissions for the spectrophotometry (each submission, corresponding to one pipeline, has been submitted by a unique participant).In this communication, we present an analysis and interpretation of the results.

**Figure 7. -** GPI estimated spectra for each injected planetary signal (in contrast to the star). The ground-truth is shown as a black solid line. The top panel shows the estimated spectra by each method, while the bottom panel highlights the difference between the ground-truth spectrum and the estimated spectra.
    For reference, the spectra extracted with the baseline method are shown with red solid lines (PCA-SADI with NEGFC). The spectra extracted with the three submissions are shown in gold (pyKLIP-FM), green (RSM), and blue (AMAT).
    From top to bottom: data set _gpi1_, _gpi2_, _gpi3_, and _gpi4_. The wavelength range of GPI is $[1.495-1.797]\mathrm{\mu m}$(around the H-band), shared in 37 spectral channels. (*fig:photom_gpi*)

**Figure 1. -** Astrometry: GPI data baseline results for each injection. On each image, the location of the injected synthetic planetary signals are shown with the orange, red and purple circles. From left to right: Temporal  median image at the shortest wavelength (left); residual map after applying a PCA-SADI post-processing, as implemented in the VIP package and using the first 10 principal components to build the reference image for subtraction (middle-left); corresponding SNR map, as implemented in the VIP package (middle-right); and astrometry estimations for each injections, using the baseline NEGFC technique (right). The latter highlights the relative astrometry errors (in pixels) for each injection (color coded) compared to the ground-truth shown as a black diamond in the center of the image. The shaded area correspond to the 1-sigma uncertainty on the astrometry estimation. From top to bottom: data set _gpi1_, _gpi2_, _gpi3_, and _gpi4_. (*fig:data_gpi*)
