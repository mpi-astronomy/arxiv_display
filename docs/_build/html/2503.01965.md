**Abstract:** The TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations, produce a diverse population of X-ray cavities in the intracluster medium (ICM) of simulated galaxy clusters. These arise from episodic, high velocity, kinetic energy injections from the central active supermassive black hole (AGN, SMBH). Here, we present the first comprehensive comparative analysis of X-ray cavities in TNG-Cluster with observational data. First, we select a volume-limited sample of 35 real clusters ( $z \leq 0.071$ , M $_\text{500c}$ = 10 $^{14-14.8}$ M $_\odot$ ) observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, identify 3 analogs for each in TNG-Cluster (total of 105) and generate mock Chandra images using same exposure times as their observed counterparts. We identify X-ray cavities and measure their properties in both datasets using identical techniques, ensuring a direct, apples-to-apples comparison. Our analysis reveals that both samples have a similar fraction of X-ray cavities (35-43 per cent). They exhibit comparable sizes and morphologies, although the sizes of simulated X-ray cavities still attached to the SMBH are somewhat larger in TNG-Cluster -- a scarcity at $< 10$ kpc. The area of TNG X-ray cavities increases as they rise in the ICM, consistent with the trend seen in the observational sample. The cavity powers, estimated using observational techniques, show good agreement between the two samples (10 $^{42-45}$ erg s $^{-1}$ ), suggesting that X-ray cavities in the simulation are an important heating mechanism in cluster cores. Overall, the rather simple AGN feedback model of TNG, with no model choices made to reproduce X-ray morphological features, and without cosmic rays, creates a quantitatively realistic population of X-ray cavities at cluster scales.

**Figure 13. -** X-ray cavity power (P$_\text{cav}$) vs. cooling luminosity (L$_\text{cool}$) for clusters with identified X-ray cavities in the TNG-Cluster sample (blue) and our observational sample (grey). Each point represents the power inferred for a single X-ray cavity; pairs are not summed up. The pink, black, and blue dashed lines represent equality between cooling and heating, assuming energy inputs of p$_\text{th}$V, 4p$_\text{th}$V, and 16p$_\text{th}$V per X-ray cavity, respectively.
    The side histograms display the distribution of P$_\text{cav}$ and L$_\text{cool}$, with 50th (dashed lines) and 16th-84th percentiles quoted in the legend. The light-grey triangles show the total X-ray cavity power in clusters of other observational studies with $z<0.2$ ([Rafferty, et. al 2006](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJ...652..216R), [Dursi and Pfrommer 2008](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...677..993D), [Hlavacek-Larrondo, et. al 2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.421.1360H), [Pandge, et. al 2013](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013Ap&SS.345..183P), [Sonkamble, et. al 2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015Ap&SS.359...61S), [Vagshette, et. al 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.466.2054V), [Kadam, et. al 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.484.4113K), [Pandge, et. al 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...870...62P), [Vagshette, Naik and Patil 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.485.1981V), [ and Liu 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.492.3156L), [ and Prasow-Ã‰mond 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160..103P), [Kyadampure, Vagshette and Patil 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021SerAJ.202...17K)) . The inset histogram shows the enthalpy distribution of the two X-ray cavity populations. In both samples, the power and enthalpy of X-ray cavities, and the cooling luminosity distributions are generally consistent (similar median and width). Importantly, TNG-Cluster and observed X-ray cavities exhibit well-consistent scaling relations, in terms of slope, normalization, and scatter. (*fig:Pcav_Lcool*)

**Figure 12. -** Comparison of X-ray cavity areas and distances from the central SMBH in the observed Prunier+2025 and TNG-Cluster matched samples. _ Main left panel:_ X-ray cavity areas vs. distance from the central SMBH (projected on the plane of the sky), with the Pearson coefficient quantifying the area-distance correlation for each sample. Blue and grey lines represent the best logarithmic fits. Red squared points denote the _attached_ X-ray cavities - i.e. for which size is equivalent to their distance from the central SMBH - in contrast to detached ones that are rising in the ICM. Histograms in the subpanels show the distribution of distances and areas, with 50th (dashed lines) and 16th-84th percentiles.
  _Right panels_, top and bottom histograms: distribution of X-ray cavity areas for attached and detached cavities, with 50th (dashed lines) and 16th-84th percentiles quoted in the legend.
  Both the observed and TNG-Cluster X-ray cavities show similar slopes and scatter in the area-distance relation, where X-ray cavities expand as they rise buoyantly from the central SMBH. We find a lack of small ($\lesssim$ 100 kpc$^2$) _ attached_ X-ray cavities in the TNG-Cluster sample compared to the observed one. (*fig:area_distance*)

Both samples have a comparable detection rate. Clusters from the observational sample show a majority of pairs, while TNG-Cluster systems most often host a single X-ray cavity. (*fig:demographics*)
