**Abstract:** The physical and chemical conditions within a protoplanetary disk play a crucial role in determining its chemical composition, which is subsequently inherited by any forming planets. To probe these conditions, high-resolution molecular line observations, coupled with modelling, are essential. In this study, we investigate the chemistry of the nearby, massive, and relatively line-rich protoplanetary disk around HD 163296 using high-resolution observations from ALMA across Bands 3, 4, 6, and 7. We constrain the disk-averaged and radial distributions of column density and excitation temperature for the detected molecules using the new retrieval code DRive . The disk chemistry is modelled using the astrochemical code PEGASIS , with variations in the initial elemental C/O ratio. Our modelling, informed by molecular observations of $\ce{HCO+}$ , $\ce{DCO+}$ , $\ce{HCN}$ , $\ce{DCN}$ , $\ce{CS}$ , $\ce{HC3N}$ , $\ce{H2CO}$ , $\ce{CH3OH}$ , $\ce{HNCO}$ , and $\ce{NH2CHO}$ , allows us to place strong constraints on the C/O ratio, with a best-fit value of 1.1 that is broadly consistent with previous estimates. We present the highest-resolution DCO $^+$ emission map of this disk to date, revealing triple-ringed chemical substructures that closely align with the dust continuum rings. Additionally, our results provide the first and most stringent upper limits on the column densities of $\ce{NH2CHO}$ and $\ce{HNCO}$ in this protoplanetary disk, measured at $< 7 \times 10^{11}$ cm $^{-2}$ and $< 1 \times 10^{11}$ cm $^{-2}$ , respectively. Our chemical models suggest that $\ce{NH2CHO}$ and $\ce{HNCO}$ predominantly form on grain surfaces within the disk. However, physico-chemical desorption mechanisms are inefficient at releasing these species into detectable gas-phase abundances, yet they remain promising targets for future ALMA observations.

**Figure 10. -** Azimuthally averaged radial profiles (first column) and radial distributions of column density (second column), excitation temperature (third column) and the corresponding optical depth, $\tau_0$(fourth column) derived from our LTE-Slab model. In the first column, the horizontal line at the upper right of each subplot indicates the beam’s major axis. Dashed vertical lines mark continuum emission peaks at 14 au, 67 au, 101 au, and 159 au, while dotted vertical lines denote continuum depressions at 49 au, 85 au, and 145 au \citep{Huang2018a}. In the second, third, and fourth columns, grey horizontal lines show the disk-averaged column density, excitation temperature, and the $\tau_0$ for the transition that has the largest central-optical depth, respectively; their widths indicate the radial range used to generate the integrated spectrum. In the first three columns, shaded regions of the same colour represent the associated uncertainties. Note that the 10 \% calibration error and spectral-autocorrelation errors are not shown in the radial integrated-intensity profile but are included in the error bars of the column density and excitation temperature (second and third columns). Optical depths in the fourth column are calculated using equation \eqref{eq:tau_0_final} at median values of column density and excitation temperatures. (*fig:radial*)

**Figure 13. -** Comparison between observationally constrained, disk-averaged column densities and model-predicted radial column density distributions for varying initial carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) abundance ratios. A chi-squared analysis identifies the best-fit model with a C/O ratio of 1.1. Two chemical evolution scenarios are presented for this case: (1) an inheritance model, in which molecular abundances are inherited from a 1 Myr-old molecular cloud, and (2) a reset model, where the disk starts with primarily elemental abundances. A 20\% uncertainty is assumed for the model column densities when comparing with observations, following the methodology of \citet{Kashyap2024}. In the figure, dot-dashed vertical lines indicate the locations of continuum gaps at 49, 85, and 145 au. Horizontal dotted black lines with downward arrows show the observationally constrained upper limits of undetected molecules, while horizontal black bars (with grey shaded uncertainty regions) indicate the disk-averaged column densities of detected molecules determined from the DRive spectral line analysis (see section \ref{sec:drive-diskavg}).
