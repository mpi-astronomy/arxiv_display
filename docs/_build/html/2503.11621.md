**Abstract:** With about 1.5 billion galaxies expected to be observed, the very large number of objects in the $\Euclid$ photometric survey will allow for precise studies of galaxy clustering from a single survey, over a large range of redshifts $0.2 < z < 2.5$ . In this work, we use photometric redshifts ( $\zph$ ) to extract the baryon acoustic oscillation signal (BAO) from the Flagship galaxy mock catalogue with a tomographic approach to constrain the evolution of the Universe and infer its cosmological parameters. We measure the two-point angular correlation function in 13 redshift bins. A template-fitting approach is applied to the measurement to extract the shift of the BAO peak through the transverse Alcock--Paczynski parameter $\alpha$ . A joint analysis of all redshift bins is performed to constrain $\alpha$ at the effective redshift $z_\mathrm{eff}=0.77$ with Markov Chain Monte-Carlo and profile likelihood techniques. We also extract one $\alpha_i$ parameter per redshift bin to quantify its evolution as a function of time. From these 13 $\alpha_i$ , which are directly proportional to the ratio $D_\mathrm{A}/ r_\mathrm{s, drag}$ , we constrain the reduced Hubble constant $h$ , the baryon density parameter $\Omb$ , and the cold dark matter density parameter $\Omcdm$ . From the joint analysis, we constrain $\alpha(z_\mathrm{eff}=0.77)=1.0011^{+0.0078}_{-0.0079}$ at the 68 \% confidence level, which represents a three-fold improvement over current constraints from the Dark Energy Survey (uncertainty of $\pm 0.023$ at $z_\mathrm{eff}=0.85$ with the same observable). As expected, the constraining power in the analysis of each redshift bin is lower, with an uncertainty ranging from $\pm 0.13$ to $\pm 0.024$ . From these results, we constrain $h$ at 0.45 \% , $\Omb$ at 0.91 \% , and $\Omcdm$ at 7.7 \% . We quantify the influence of analysis choices like the template, scale cuts, redshift bins, and systematic effects like redshift-space distortions over our constraints both at the level of the extracted $\alpha_i$ parameters and at the level of cosmological inference.

**Figure 6. -** Comparison of cosmological parameters obtained when one or several redshift bins are removed from the analysis. The fiducial values of the simulation are highlighted as a vertical dashed line. The baseline including all bins is shown at the top as a reference. The results in blue and orange are respectively obtained from the $\alpha_{i}$ extracted by template fitting of the $w(\theta)$ measured on Flagship and a noise-free synthetic $w(\theta)$.

**Figure 9. -** Two-point angular correlation function measured on the Flagship simulation in 13 redshift bins. The errors come from the analytical covariance presented in Sect. \ref{sc:covariance}. The orange curve is the correlation function computed using the template from Eq.\eqref{eq:template_BAO} evaluated with the parameters inferred from MCMC in each redshift bin. Scale cuts are shown as grey bands and are defined as $\thmin=\ang{0.6}$, $\thmax=\thbao+\ang{2.5}$ where $\thbao$ is the expected position of the BAO peak in the fiducial cosmology.
