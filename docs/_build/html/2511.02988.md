**Abstract:** Massive early-type galaxies (ETGs; $M > 10^{11} M_\odot$ ) are believed to form primarily throughmergers of less massive progenitors, leaving behind numerous traces of violentformation histories, such as stellar streams and shells. A particularly strikingsignature of these mergers is the formation of supermassive black hole (SMBH)binaries, which can create depleted stellar cores through interactions withstars on radial orbits -- a process known as core scouring.The secondary SMBH in such systems may still carry a dense stellar envelope andthereby remain observable for some time as a secondary nucleus, while it is sinkingtowards the shared gravitational potential of the merged galaxy.Direct observations ofsecondary nuclei on sub-kiloparsec scales remain rare, with only a few notablecases, such as NGC 5419. Investigating such features and building up statisticsrequires both high spatial resolution and wide-field coverage, a capabilityuniquely provided by $\Euclid$ .In this study, we leverage $\Euclid$ ’s Q1 Early Release data to systematicallysearch for secondary nuclei in ETGs. We present a preliminary sample of $\numcanddnuclei$ candidate systems distributed over $\numetwithdnuclei$ hosts(some of which contain multiple secondary nuclei). The vast majority of thesefall at separations of $\SI{3}{\kilo\parsec}$ to $\SI{15}{\kilo\parsec}$ , indicativeof normal mergers. $\numcandlttwokpc$ fall at projected separations of less than $\SI{2}{\kilo\parsec}$ .In the discussion, we argue that this mostinteresting subset of secondary nucleus candidates -- those at very close angularseparations -- are unlikely to be a consequence of chance alignments. We show thattheir stellar masses are mostly too large for them to be globular clusters andthat a significant subset are unresolved even at $\Euclid$ 's spatial resolution,rendering them too small to be dwarf galaxies. These may representthe highest-density nuclei of a previously merged galaxy, currently sinking intothe centre of the new, common gravitational potential and thus likely to host asecondary SMBH. We then demonstrate that convolutional neural networks offer aviable avenue to detect multiple nuclei in the thirty-times larger sky coverageof the future $\Euclid$ DR1.Finally, we argue that our methodcould detect the remnants of a recoil event from two merged SMBHs: Two of oursecondary nuclei candidates are unresolved atthe $\Euclid$ spatial resolution, occurat projected physical separations of less than 2 kpc, and occur in hostsof $M > 10^{11} M_\odot$ , which makes them viable candidates.

**Figure 2. -** Comparison of photometric redshift estimates by PHZ to
    spectroscopic measurements. We show all objects in our early-type subsample
    where spectroscopic data are available. The limited precision in the various
    space- and ground-based imaging channels still limits the accuracy of
    photometric redshifts in Q1. Any quantity that is derived from the
    photometric redshift thus needs to be taken with care.

**Figure 7. -** Distribution of angular separations.
    We estimate angular separations of the secondary light peak centre
    from the centre of the host as determined by the Sérsic model fit.
    The centres of the candidate nuclei are estimated using a simple
    centre-of-mass approach within a manually placed aperture on the
    residual image. (*fig:angular_separation*)
