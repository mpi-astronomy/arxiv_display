**Abstract:** The ESA $\Euclid$ mission will survey more than 14 000 deg $^2$ of the sky in visible and near-infrared wavelengths, mapping the extra-galactic sky to constrain our cosmological model of the Universe. Although the survey focusses on regions further than 15◦ from the ecliptic, it should allow for the detection of more than about $10^5$ Solar System objects (SSOs). After simulating the expected signal from SSOs in $\Euclid$ images acquired with the visible camera (VIS), we describe an automated pipeline developed to detect moving objects with an apparent velocity in the range of $0.1$ -- $10\arcsec{\rm h}^{-1}$ , typically corresponding to sources in the outer Solar System (from Centaurs to Kuiper-belt objects). In particular, the proposed detection scheme is based on $\sext$ software and on applying a new algorithm capable of associating moving objects amongst different catalogues. After applying a suite of filters to improve the detection quality, we study the expected purity and completeness of the SSO detections. We also show how a Kohonen self-organising neural network can be successfully trained (in an unsupervised fashion) to classify stars, galaxies, and SSOs. By implementing an early-stopping method in the training scheme, we show that the network can be used in a predictive way, allowing one to assign the probability of each detected object being a member of each considered class.

**Figure 1. -** SSO probability map (for a $20\times 20$ SOM) associated with the trained neural network (see text for details). The value of each pixel (according to the associated colour bar) gives the normalised probability that the data falling in that particular neuron belongs to the SSO class. The probability is normalised so that by summing up the probability per class, one gets exactly 100\%. (*result_4-a*)

**Figure 9. -** Performance of the SOM evaluated by calculating the average map error, $S(t)$(solid black line, _left_ panels), and number of movements, $N_{\rm move}(t)$, in a given epoch, $t$(_right_ panels). In the _left_ panels, we also give the average error of the SOM when applied to the validation input data (yellow line). The dashed vertical lines represent, for each panel, the epoch associated with the early-stopping method (see text for details).

**Figure 10. -** 20 $\times$ 20 U-matrix of the SOM trained to classify stars, galaxies, and SSOs. Using the training data, we superimposed a different symbol and colour in the middle of each node for each type of input vector (blue circles for stars, green squares for galaxies, and red diamonds for SSOs), confirming that the SOM correctly classified the data. The dots appearing in each pixel (with a different colour for each class) indicate the number of objects of the particular class classified by the SOM. The underlying grey-scale image represents the U-matrix associated with the trained SOM, {while numbers along the axes represent the neuron position in the map.} (*result_2*)
