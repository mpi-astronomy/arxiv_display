**Abstract:** Analysis of the gaseous component in protoplanetary disks can inform us about their thermal and physical structure, chemical composition, and kinematic properties, all of which are crucial for understanding various processes within the disks.By exploiting the asymmetry of the line emission, or via line profile analysis, we can locate the emitting surfaces.Here, we present the emission surfaces of the exoALMA sources in $^{12}$ CO $J=3-2$ , $^{13}$ CO $J=3-2$ , and CS $J=7-6$ . We find that $^{12}$ CO traces the upper disk atmosphere, with mean $\zr$ values of $\approx$ 0.28, while $^{13}$ CO and CS trace lower regions of the disk with mean $\zr$ values of $\approx$ 0.16 and $\approx$ 0.18, respectively.We find that $^{12}$ CO $\zr$ and the disk mass are positively correlated with each other; this relationship offers a straightforward way to infer the disk mass.We derive 2-D $r-z$ temperature distributions of the disks. Additionally, we search for substructure in the surfaces and radial intensity profiles; we find evidence of localized substructure in the emission surfaces and peak intensity profiles of nearly every disk, with this substructure often being co-incident between molecular tracers, intensity profiles, and kinematic perturbations. Four disks display evidence of potential photo-desorption, implying that this effect may be common even in low FUV star-forming regions. For most disks, we find that the physical and thermal structure is more complex than analytical models can account for, highlighting a need for more theoretical work and a better understanding of the role of projection effects on our observations.

**Figure 11. -** Non-parametric (data points) and parametric surfaces (solid and dashed curves) for $^{12}$CO $J=3-2$. The larger black points represent radially binned data. We exclude two disks $\maria${(HD 135344B and J1604)} whose surfaces could not be extracted due to a face-on geometry. Background gray lines show scale heights $(z/r)$ from 0.1 to 0.6 with 0.1 increments. The darker blue solid line shows the tapered power law surface fit from $\discminer$ , and the light blue and gray dashed line shows the tapered power law fit from $\disksurf$ , which uses the background data points. The gray cross markers for AA Tau and SY Cha show the diffuse outer surface points that we do not include in the parametric fits. (*fig:surfaces_12co*)

**Figure 14. -** Rolling surfaces made from the raw $r-z$\disksurf  emission surface points for $^{12}$CO $J=3-2$(blue), $^{13}$CO $J=3-2$(orange), and CS $J=7-6$(pink). Vertical dashed lines denote emission surface substructure, whose identification is discussed in Section \ref{sec:substucture}. We label dips in the emission surfaces with the nomenclature first used in [Law, Teague and Loomis (2021)](), where `Z' denotes a dip in the emission surface, followed by the radial location in au. We also plot the continuum rings (solid gray lines) and gaps (dashed gray lines) identified in [Curone, et. al (2025)]().
    Thin background gray lines show scale heights $(z/r)$ from 0.1 to 0.6 with 0.1 increments. The beamsize of $0$\farcs$15$ is shown in the upper right corner for each disk. AA Tau is zoomed in to better show structure. (*fig:rolling_surfaces*)

**Figure 12. -** The same as Figure \ref{fig:surfaces_12co}, but for $^{13}$CO $J=3-2$. The orange solid line shows the tapered power law surface fit from $\discminer$ , and the gray and peach dashed line shows the tapered power law fit from $\disksurf$ . (*fig:surfaces_13co*)
