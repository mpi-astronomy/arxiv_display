**Abstract:** Observations of protoplanetary disks within multiple systems in nearby star-forming regions (SFRs) have shown that the presence of a neighboring object influences the evolution of dust of disks. However, the sample size available and the separation range covered are insufficient to fully understand the dust evolution in binary systems. The goal of this work is to comprehensively characterize the impact of stellar multiplicity on Class II disks in the L1641 and L1647 regions of Orion A ( $\sim$ 1-3 Myr), part of the Survey of Orion Disks with ALMA (SODA). We characterize the protostellar multiplicity using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the ESO-VISTA, and Hubble Space telescopes. The resulting sample of 65 multiple systems represents the largest catalogue of wide binary systems to date (projected separation $\geq$ 1000 AU), allowing a more robust statistical characterization of the evolution and properties of protoplanetary disks. The disk population was observed in continuum with ALMA at 225 GHz, with a median rms of 1.5 M $_{\oplus}$ . Combining these data (resolution $\sim$ 1.1 $^{"}$ ) with the ESO-VISTA near-infrared survey of the Orion A cloud (resolution $\sim$ 0.7 $^{"}$ ), multiple systems are assembled and selected by an iterative inside-out search in projected separation ( $\geq$ 1000 AU). We identify 61 binary systems, 3 triple systems, and one quadruple system. The separation range is between 1000 and 10 $^4$ AU. The dust mass distributions inferred with the Kaplan-Meier estimator yield a median mass of 3.23 $^{+0.6}_{-0.4}$ M $_{\oplus}$ for primary disks and 3.88 $^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$ M $_{\oplus}$ for secondary disks. Combining our data with those available for Lupus and Taurus disks, we identify a threshold separation of about 130 AU, beyond which the previously observed positive correlation between millimeter flux (and hence dust mass) and projected separation is lost. Recent theoretical models confirm that pre- and post-threshold systems are the result of different star formation processes, such as the fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable circumstellar disks, the thermal fragmentation of infalling cores, or the turbulent fragmentation of molecular clouds. We can rule out the dependency on different SFRs: the cumulative mass distribution of multiples in SFRs of similar age are statistically indistinguishable. This result strengthens the hypothesis that there is a universal initial mass distribution for disks.

**Figure 30. -** Pair millimeter flux (re-scaled to a distance of $d=140 pc$) and dust mass of binary systems as a function of their projected separation, located in Orion A, Lupus  ([Zurlo, Cieza and Ansdell 2021](), [Ansdell, Williams and Trapman 2018]()) , and Taurus  ([Akeson, Jensen and Carpenter 2020](), [Manara, Tazzari and Long 2019](), [ and Akeson 2014](),  Harris_2012) . Crosses represent detections and triangles represent non-detections: according to [Akeson, Jensen and Carpenter (2020)](), we consider a binary pair to be detected only if both disk components were detected. In blue is the linear regression (slope $m=0.69^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$, intercept $q=-0.45^{+0.31}_{-0.33}$) from [Zagaria, Rosotti and Lodato (2021)](), and in purple is the linear regression (slope $m=0.15^{+0.11}_{-0.12}$, intercept $q=0.92^{+0.34}_{-0.32}$) we get considering also our binary sample.
