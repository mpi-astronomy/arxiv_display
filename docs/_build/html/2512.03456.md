**Abstract:** We present a comprehensive study of mid-infrared neutral hydrogen (H i ) emission lines in 79 nearby (d $<$ 200 $pc$ ) young stars using the _James Webb Space Telescope_ ( _JWST_ ) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). This work extends accretion diagnostics to mid-infrared H i transitions, which are less affected by extinction and outflow emission compared to optical and near-infrared H i lines. We aim to identify mid-infrared H i transitions that can serve as reliable accretion diagnostics in young stars, and evaluate their utility in deriving physical conditions of the accreting gas. We identify and measure 22 H i transitions in the MIRI wavelength regime (5–28 $\mu m$ ) and perform LTE slab modelling to remove the H \textsubscript{2} O contribution from selected H i transitions. We examine the spatial extent of MIR H i emission and assess contamination from molecular and jet-related emission. We find that mid-IR H i line emission is spatially compact, even for sources with spatially extended [ Ne ii ] and [ Fe ii ] jets, suggesting minimal contamination from extended jet. Although Pfund $\alpha$ (H i 6--5) and Humphreys $\alpha$ (H i 7--6) are the strongest lines in the mid-infrared, they are blended with $H_2$ O transitions. This blending necessitates additional processing to remove molecular contamination, thereby limiting their use as accretion diagnostics. Instead, we identify the H i (8--6) at 7.502 $\mu m$ and H i (10--7) at 8.760 $\mu m$ transitions as better alternatives, as they are largely unaffected by molecular contamination and offer a more reliable means of measuring accretion rates from MIRI spectra. We provide updated empirical relations for converting mid-IR H i line luminosities into accretion luminosity for 6 different H i lines in the MIRI wavelength range. Moreover, comparison of observed line ratios with theoretical models shows that MIR H i lines offer robust constraints on the hydrogen gas density in accretion columns, $n_\mathrm{H} = $ 10 $^{10.6}$ to 10 $^{11.2}$ cm $^{-3}$ in most stars, with some stars exhibiting lower densities ( $<10^{10}$ cm $^{-3}$ ), approaching the optically thin regime.

**Figure 6. -** New and updated H i empirical relations. Empirical correlations between accretion luminosity (log($L_{\rm acc}/L_{\odot}$)) and MIR H i line luminosities (log($L_{\rm line}/L_{\odot}$)) for six transitions analysed in this work. Each panel displays the linear regression best-fit (black dashed line) with 1$\sigma$ and 3$\sigma$ confidence intervals (shaded regions). The best-fit slope and intercept are shown in the bottom-right corner of each panel and listed in Table \ref{tab:2}. Blue open squares represent sources without correction for $H_2$O contamination, while green open circles correspond to sources where the H i line fluxes have been corrected using LTE $H_2$O models. The pink circles represent the newly measured log(L$_{acc}$) values for sources that lack literature values, while the red arrows denote 3$\sigma$ upper limits for non-detections. The dash-dotted lines in the middle panels indicate the empirical relations reported by [Tofflemire, et. al (2025)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...985..224T) for reference. (*fig:5*)

**Figure 5. -** Contribution of H\textsubscript{2}O to 3 H i lines. Left panels: Estimated percentage contribution of $H_2$O emission to the observed H i transitions—H i(12--7), H i(7--6), and H i(6--5)—across the Class II disk sample. Blue stars indicate the fractional $H_2$O contribution for each source. Green upward arrows denote sources where the entire flux is attributable to $H_2$O, while red downward arrows mark sources for which $H_2$O modelling was not applied due to either dominant H i flux or negligible $H_2$O emission. Right panels: Violin plots showing the distributions of best-fit physical parameters from LTE $H_2$O models for each wavelength region. The temperature and effective emitting radius exhibit an anti-correlation, consistent with compact hot inner disk emission dominating at shorter wavelengths. The $H_2$O column densities remain relatively constant across the different spectral regions.

**Figure 7. -** {Comparison of different H i empirical relations. (Left) Estimated empirical slopes of optical/NIR H i lines from the literature  ([Alcal\'a, et. al 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A&A...600A..20A), [Rogers, de Marchi and Brandl 2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A&A...684L...8R), [Salyk, et. al 2013](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...769...21S))  and mid-infrared H i lines from this work. The colour bar and marker colours indicate the wavelength of each H i transition. The median slope of the distribution is $\sim$1.1, shown with a dashed line.} The slope of the Pa$\alpha$ empirical relation  ([Rogers, de Marchi and Brandl 2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A&A...684L...8R))  is slightly offset from other H i lines, as it was calibrated using _JWST_ spectra of young stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which has sub-solar metallicity. This lower metallicity likely affects the slope. {(Right) Comparison of empirical relations between accretion luminosity ($\log L_{\mathrm{acc}}$) and line luminosity ($\log L_{\mathrm{line}}$) for representative H i transitions from optical to mid-infrared wavelengths. The slopes are consistent across this wide wavelength range.} (*fig:6*)
