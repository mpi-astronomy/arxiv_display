**Abstract:** In the hierarchical view of star formation, giant molecular gas clouds (GMCs) undergo fragmentation to form small-scale structures made up of stars and star clusters. Here we study the connection between young star clusters and cold gas across a range of extragalactic environments by combining the high resolution (1$\arcsec$) PHANGS--ALMA catalogue of GMCs with the star cluster catalogues from PHANGS--HST. The star clusters are spatially matched with the GMCs across a sample of$11$nearby star-forming galaxies with a range of galactic environments (centres, bars, spiral arms, etc.).  We find that after$4{-}6$Myr the star clusters are no longer associated with any gas clouds. Additionally, we measure the autocorrelation of the star clusters and GMCs as well as their cross-correlation to quantify the fractal nature of hierarchical star formation. Young (${\leq}10$Myr) star clusters are more strongly autocorrelated on kpc and smaller spatial scales than the$>10$Myr stellar populations, indicating that the hierarchical structure dissolves over time.

**Figure 10. -** Two-point (auto) correlation functions for all star clusters (black), clusters ${\leq}10$ Myr (blue), clusters ${>}10$ Myr (red), and GMCs (orange). The line at $1 + \omega(\theta) = 1$ marks where a uniform, random distribution. Twice the median radius of the GMCs in each galaxy is shown as the vertical grey line. Uncertainties are bootstrap estimates. The thick grey line marks the distance range over which the power-laws are fit; the best-fitting power-law slopes are given in Table \ref{tab:tpcf_plaw}. Correlation functions which exhibit anti-correlation ($1 + \omega(\theta) < 1$) are most likely artifacts of the random sampling i.e., there are more random points than data points for that angular bin. In which case, correlation at these bins can be considered consistent with a random distribution. (*fig:tpcf_grid*)

**Figure 2. -** Histograms of the star cluster ages sorted according to association with GMCs in NGC 1566: all star clusters (grey), within one GMC radius (blue), between 1 and 2 GMC radii (green), between 2 and 3 GMC radii (orange), and beyond 3 GMC radii which is considered unassociated (fuchsia). Vertical dashed lines mark the median cluster age for each distribution. A $10$ km s$^{-1}$ velocity cutoff is applied to minimize counting clusters which have random alignment with the GMCs.

**Figure 7. -** Histograms of the separations between star clusters and the centre of the nearest neighbour GMC for each of the 11 galaxies and an ensemble of all the galaxies. The distribution for the full sample of star clusters is shown in grey, for clusters ${\leq}10$ Myr is blue, and for clusters ${>}10$ Myr is red. Median separations for each distribution are marked with dashed lines.  Theoretical estimates for the nearest neighbor separations for NGC 0628, NGC 3351, NGC 3627, NGC 4535, and the ensemble are provided by green dotted lines (see text).  The histograms are normalized by the total number of counts and the bin width for each histogram. (*fig:1nn_grid*)
