**Abstract:** We present an overview and first results from the Spectroscopic Ultradeep Survey Probing Extragalactic Near-infrared Stellar Emission (SUSPENSE), executed with NIRSpec on JWST. The primary goal of the SUSPENSE program is to characterize the stellar, chemical, and kinematic properties of massive quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon. In a single deep NIRSpec/MSA configuration, we target 20 distant quiescent galaxy candidates ( $z=1-3$ , $H_{AB}<23$ ), as well as 53 star-forming galaxies at $z=1-4$ . With 16 hr of integration and the G140M-F100LP dispersion-filter combination, we observe numerous Balmer and metal absorption lines for all quiescent candidates. We derive stellar masses (log $M_*/M_{\odot}\sim10.3-11.5$ ) and detailed star-formation histories (SFHs) and show that all 20 candidate quiescent galaxies indeed have quenched stellar populations. These galaxies show a variety of mass-weighted ages ( $0.8-3.0$ Gyr) and star formation timescales ( $\sim0.5-4$ Gyr), and four out of 20 galaxies were already quiescent by $z=3$ . On average, the $z>1.75$ $[z<1.75]$ galaxies formed 50 \% of their stellar mass before $z=4$ $[z=3]$ . Furthermore, the typical SFHs of galaxies in these two redshift bins ( $z_{\text{mean}}=2.2$ and $z_{\text{mean}}=1.3$ ) indicate that galaxies at higher redshift formed earlier and over shorter star-formation timescales compared to lower redshifts. Although this evolution is naturally explained by the growth of the quiescent galaxy population over cosmic time, we cannot rule out that mergers and late-time star formation also contribute to the evolution. In future work, we will further unravel the early formation, quenching, and late-time evolution of these galaxies by extending this work with studies on their chemical abundances, resolved stellar populations and kinematics.

**Figure 6. -** Top panel: Distribution of the observed redshifts, separated in two redshift bins. The dashed lines indicate the mean redshift of each bin. Middle panel: the average SFH of all quiescent targets, separated into two redshift bins. Here the SFH corresponds to the total mass fraction formed as a function of age of the universe. Bottom panel: the summed SFR of all quiescent galaxies as a function of age of the universe, separated into two redshift bins. Before summing the SFRs of the galaxies we first normalize them by their total stellar mass. The shaded regions around the mean SFHs indicate the error on the mean. In the middle and bottom panels, the dotted vertical lines indicate the average $t_{\text{form}}$ of each redshift bin, with the vertical bands corresponding to the standard deviation of $t_{\text{form}}$.

**Figure 11. -** Overview of UltraVISTA photometric SEDs (bottom-left), NIRSpec spectra (right), and HST image (top-left) of two example quiescent galaxies in our survey. The 2D spectra for the two observed dithers and the combined 1D spectrum are shown in the top-right and bottom-right rows, respectively. Flux densities ($F_{\lambda}$) are in $10^{-19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ Ã…$^{-1}$. The coverage of the NIRSpec spectra are indicated in the SED panels by the gray rectangles. The best-fit \texttt{Prospector} models to the photometry and spectra are shown in red (see Section \ref{sec:prosp}). The images in the top-left panels show the HST-F160W imaging, with an overlay of the NIRSpec MSA slit orientation for one nod position. In Appendix \ref{ap:all_spec} we show this figure for all targeted quiescent galaxies. (*fig:example_q_spec*)
