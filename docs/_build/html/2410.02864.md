**Abstract:** The structure and chemistry of the dusty interstellar medium (ISM) are shaped by complex processes that depend on the local radiation field, gas composition, and dust grain properties. Of particular importance are Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), which emit strong vibrational bands in the mid-infrared, and play a key role in the ISM energy balance. We recently identified global correlations between PAH band and optical line ratios across three nearby galaxies, suggesting a connection between PAH heating and gas ionization throughout the ISM. In this work, we perform a census of the PAH heating -- gas ionization connection using $\sim$ 700,000 independent pixels that probe scales of 40--150 pc in nineteen nearby star-forming galaxies from the PHANGS survey. We find a universal relation between $\log$ PAH(11.3 $\mic$ /7.7 $\mic$ ) and $\log$ ( [ SII ] /H $\alpha$ ) with a slope of $\sim$ 0.2 and a scatter of $\sim$ 0.025 dex. The only exception is a group of anomalous pixels that show unusually high (11.3 $\mic$ /7.7 $\mic$ ) PAH ratios in regions with old stellar populations and high starlight-to-dust emission ratios. Their mid-infrared spectra resemble those of elliptical galaxies. AGN hosts show modestly steeper slopes, with a $\sim$ 10 \% increase in PAH(11.3 $\mic$ /7.7 $\mic$ ) in the diffuse gas on kpc scales. This universal relation implies an emerging simplicity in the complex ISM, with a sequence that is driven by a single varying property: the spectral shape of the interstellar radiation field. This suggests that other properties, such as gas-phase abundances, gas ionization parameter, and grain charge distribution, are relatively uniform in all but specific cases.

**Figure 6. -** **The $\mathrm{\log**$PAH(11.3/7.7) versus $\sii$halpha relations across individual PHANGS galaxies on scales of 40--120 pc.} Each panel shows the 2D distribution of the $\log$PAH(11.3/7.7) band ratio versus the $\sii$halpha optical line ratio across a single PHANGS galaxy. The gray color-coding represent the number of pixels with the corresponding PAH and optical line ratios, where the total number of pixels ranges from 9 000 to 80 000, with most galaxies having around 20 000 spatially independent pixels. The black contours encompass the regions within which the counts are 5, 20, and 50. The relations are obtained using the maps at the $C_{\mathrm{opt}}$ resolution, and each panel notes the spatial scale in parsec probed for the galaxy. The red error bars represent 6 bins in $\sii$halpha and their medians and median absolute deviations of the $\log$PAH(11.3/7.7) ratio in the bin. The red solid lines represent the best-fitting linear relations of the bins. The galaxies are ordered by their best-fitting slope, from the shallowest (NGC 1087) to the steepest (NGC 1365). Galaxies with pixels belonging to the anomalous group identified in Section \ref{sec:results:PCA} and studied separately in Section \ref{sec:results:anomalous_PAHs} are marked with orange edges. These pixels are filtered out and excluded from 2D histograms, contours, and best fits. Galaxies with known Seyfert nuclei are marked with blue edges. (*f:correlations_sep_ordered_by_slope*)

**Figure 5. -** **Two-dimensional visualization by {\sc pca** of the optical-infrared feature space spanned by $\sim$100 000 150 pc-scale pixels from the 19 PHANGS galaxies.}
The top left panel shows the result of the {\sc pca} decomposition applied to 108 403 spatially independent pixels that trace different optical and infrared features measured over a 150 pc scale. The bars represent the fraction of explained variance by each of the principal components, with the first component accounting for 41\% of the full variance, and the second for 17\%. Together, they account for 58\% of the total variance in the data. The inset in the top left panel shows the location of the pixels in the two-dimensional plane spanned by these first two orthogonal principal components. In the rest of the panels, the distribution of the pixels in this 2D plane is color-coded by different features of interest, where it can be seen that the first principal component (x-axis) aligns roughly with the $\log$PAH(11.3/7.7) versus optical line sequence, and the second component (y-axis) aligns roughly with the PAH-to-total dust mass fraction, $R_{\mathrm{PAH}}$. In the bottom row, we mark a group of pixels that show anomalously high $\log$PAH(11.3/7.7) ratios of $\sim$0.7 dex (typical $\log$PAH(11.3/7.7) ratios show a maximum of $\sim$0.4 dex, see Section \ref{sec:results:correlations}). The same group of pixels originates from regions dominated by old stellar populations, very high stellar-to-mid infrared emission ratio (suggesting old and bright populations), and relatively low PAH-to-hot dust ratio. We study this anomalous group in Section \ref{sec:results:anomalous_PAHs}. (*f:feature_display*)

**Figure 14. -** **Emerging picture of PAH band--optical line ratios correlations across nearby star-forming galaxies.****The left panel** depicts a typical nearby star-forming galaxy, where there is a tight correlation between $\log$PAH(11.3/7.7) and $\sii$halpha ratios on 40--150 pc scales. Similarly tight correlations are observed with other optical line ratios: $\oiii$hbeta, $\nii$halpha, and $\oi$halpha. The bottom left part of the relation is dominated by star-forming regions, where young massive stars ionize the gas. The top right part of the relation corresponds to diffuse regions on kpc scales, where a combination of radiation leaking from HII regions and from hot and evolved stars ionizes the gas, giving rise to LINER/LIER-like optical line ratios. The slope of the relation is $\beta \sim 0.2$, roughly matching the expected relation for a varying radiation field that heats the PAHs and ionizes the gas (see \citetalias{baron24}). The small scatter in the relation, $\sim$ 0.025 dex, suggests uniform PAH ionization fraction across different environments and galaxies. **The middle panel** represents a small group of pixels observed in a handful of galaxies, showing anomalously-high $\log$PAH(11.3/7.7) ratios for a constant $\sii$halpha ratio. Such PAH ratios are observed in regions with old stellar populations and unusually high starlight-to-dust emission ratio, $\log$F200W/F770W$>$ 0.4 dex. The anomalous ratios are consistent with PAH populations with larger grain sizes, which can be either the result of processes that change the typical ISM grain population as it streams into the center (destruction via shocks or under-production in grain-grain collisions), or the result of a varying mixing between two grain populations: those of the typical dusty ISM and those produced in AGB star atmospheres. **The right panel** shows a star-forming galaxy with a low luminosity AGN in its center. The AGN contributes to the total radiation field affecting the PAHs and ionized gas on kpc scales, resulting in a small enhancement of $\log$PAH(11.3/7.7)$\sim$0.05 dex$\sim$10\%. The AGN has little impact on the $\sii$halpha ratio, but a stronger impact on the $\oiii$hbeta ratio, with the two optical line ratios consistent with Seyfert-like ionization in standard line diagnostic diagrams.
