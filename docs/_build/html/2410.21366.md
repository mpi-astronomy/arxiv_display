**Abstract:** Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxy clusters plays a key role in determining the properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) and in regulating star formation, often manifesting through prominent X-ray cavities embedded in the cluster's hot atmosphere. Here we show that X-ray cavities arise naturally due to AGN feedback in TNG-Cluster. This is a new suite of magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution, and hence of galaxy clusters, whereby cold dark matter, baryon dynamics, galactic astrophysics, and magnetic fields are evolved together consistently. We construct mock Chandra X-ray observations of the central region of the 352 galaxy clusters in the simulation at $z=0$ and inspect them for X-ray cavities as typically done in observations. We show that X-ray cavities are common in TNG-Cluster, with $\sim$ 39 per cent of the simulated clusters featuring one or more X-ray cavities. Identified X-ray cavities come in a variety of configurations, including single, pairs, and multiples. Some are still attached to SMBHs, while others have buoyantly risen to larger distances. Their size ranges from a few to several tens of kpc. In terms of gas physical properties, TNG-Cluster X-ray cavities are underdense compared to the surrounding halo and filled with hot gas ( $\sim$ 10 $^8$ K); 25 per cent of them are surrounded by an X-ray bright and compressed rim associated with a weak shock (Mach number $\sim 1.5$ ). Clusters exhibiting X-ray cavities are preferentially strong or weak cool-cores, are dynamically relaxed, and host SMBHs accreting at low Eddington rates. We show that TNG-Cluster X-ray cavities originate from episodic, wind-like energy injections from central AGN. Our results illustrate the existence and diversity of X-ray cavities simulated in state-of-the-art models within realistic cosmological environments and show that these can form without necessarily invoking bipolar, collimated, or relativistic jets.

**Figure 4. -** Maps of the thermodynamic and kinematic properties of the gas within an example TNG-Cluster system (Halo 16921354; maps side length: 200 kpc, depth: 20 kpc). Two X-ray cavities are visible: the first is attached to the central SMBH and exhibits a bright rim, while the second is detached and rising in the ICM. These X-ray cavities appear as under-dense and under-X-ray luminous regions filled with hot gas. Additionally, the attached X-ray cavity has an over-pressurized edge and a weak shock front with a Mach number of $\sim$ 1.3 (mass-weighted average Mach number along the line of sight, according to the shock finder: here the averages are obtained by only considering gas cells with shock Mach number larger than 0.9), while the detached X-ray cavity does not display such a feature. This panel illustrates the varying thermodynamic states of the gas within and surrounding the X-ray cavities. It highlights the typical properties of the X-ray cavity population identified in the TNG-Cluster simulation. (*fig:panel_cav_phys_pro*)

**Figure 5. -** Demographics of clusters with and without identified X-ray cavities in the TNG-Cluster simulation at $z=0$. _Top left:_ Percentage of clusters with identified X-ray cavities. _Top right:_ Among clusters with identified X-ray cavities, percentage of clusters having one, two, three, or four X-ray cavities.     _Bottom Left:_ Percentage distribution of cool-core (CC), weak cool-core (WCC), and non-cool-core (NCC) clusters for each category of clusters with or without identified X-ray cavities. The plot shows, for clusters with two X-ray cavities (x-label "2"), that 54 per cent of the TNG-Cluster halos hosting two X-ray cavities are SCCs and 46 per cent WCCs. _ Bottom middle:_ Central cooling time vs. X-ray luminosity within $r_{500\text{c}}$ for each halo, color-coded by the number of identified X-ray cavities. _Bottom Right:_ Central cooling time vs. the distance between the SMBH and the X-ray luminosity peak, i.e. a measure of un/relaxedness, color-coded by the number of identified X-ray cavities. In TNG-Cluster, $\sim$ 39 per cent of clusters exhibit at least one X-ray cavity. Clusters with identified X-ray cavities tend to have shorter central cooling times and higher X-ray luminosities, and to be more relaxed (smaller X-ray peak offset). (*fig:panel*)

**Figure 6. -** Time evolution of selected quantities from the TNG300 most massive cluster, for which high temporal cadence output is available. The top two rows show six X-ray emission maps of the central region of the cluster, across 55 Myr, featuring two X-ray cavity events occurring in the second and last frame: mock Chandra surface brightness maps and the same maps processed with an unsharp mask filter to highlight X-ray-depleted regions, respectively. From top to bottom, the lower three panels quantify the time evolution of: _i)_ energy injected in kinetic mode by the SMBH between two successive snapshots, i.e. across time spans of about 10 Myrs; _ii)_ maximum radial outflow velocities (95th percentile) of the gas at different distances from the SMBH; and _iii)_ SMBH accretion rate. In all panels, the two dotted vertical lines indicate the frames just before the first and second X-ray cavities appear. The two events are characterized by a 10$^{42-43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ kinetic energy release and high-velocity gas outflows, as well as concomitant decreases in the SMBH accretion rate. See continuation in Figure \ref{fig:subboxe_1gyr}. (*fig:subboxe_panel*)
