**Abstract:** The largest reservoir of carbon in protoplanetary discs is stored in refractory organics, which thermally decompose into the gas-phase at the organics line, well interior to the water iceline. Because this region is so close to the host star, it is often assumed that the released gaseous material is rapidly accreted and plays little role in the evolution of the disc composition. However, laboratory experiments show that the thermal decomposition process is irreversible, breaking macromolecular refractory organics into simpler, volatile carbon-bearing compounds. As a result, unlike the iceline of other volatiles, which traps vapor inwards due to recondensation, the organics line remains permeable, allowing gaseous carbon to diffuse outward without returning to the solid phase. In this paper, we investigate how this process affects the disc composition, particularly the gas-phase C/H and C/O ratios, by incorporating it into a 1D evolution model for gas and solids, and assuming refractory organics dominantly decompose into $C_2$ $H_2$ . Our results show that this process allows this carbon-rich gas to survive well beyond the organics line (out to $7 \mathrm{ au}$ around a solar-mass star) and for much longer timescales, such that its abundance is increased by an order of magnitude. This has several implications in planet formation, notably by altering how the composition of solids and gas relate, and the fraction of heavy elements available to giant planets. In the framework of our model, refractory organics significantly influence the evolution of the gas-phase C/O ratio, which may help $\edited{interpreting}$ measurements made $\edited{with}$ Spitzer and JWST.

**Figure 10. -** Gas-phase (left panel) and solid-phase (right panel) C/O ratios as functions of distance from a solar-mass star for a disc characterised by $\alpha = 10^{-3}$. Blue lines represent a standard model that excludes the thermal decomposition of refractory organics \citep[e.g.,][]{mah2023close}, while red lines show the results from our model, including that effect. The horizontal dashed grey line represents the initial C/O ratio. The sublimation lines of the main species contributing to the C/O ratio are indicated with vertical lines. From this plot, we see that the thermal decomposition of refractory organics significantly influences the gas-phase and solid-phase C/O ratio in the disc. The gas-phase C/O ratio is generally much higher when the thermal decomposition of refractory organics is included. (*fig:CO_vs_radius_tr_vs_notr*)

**Figure 2. -** Gas-phase C/H ratio (normalised by the ratio at $t_0$) as a function of distance from a solar-mass star for a disc characterised by $\alpha = 10^{-3}$. Blue lines represent a standard model that excludes the thermal decomposition of refractory organics \citep[e.g.,][]{mah2023close}, while red lines show the results from our model, including that effect. The sublimation lines of the main species contributing to the C/O ratio are indicated with vertical lines. From this plot, we see that the thermal decomposition of refractory organics re-distributes gaseous carbon-bearing species through the disc, hence significantly influences the gas-phase C/H ratio.

**Figure 9. -** Gas surface density (top) and solid surface density (bottom) of the main chemical species that contribute to the C/O ratio at $0.1$, $1$, and $5 \mathrm{ Myr}$. We ran this simulation with $M_{*} = 1 \mathrm{ M_\odot}$ and $\alpha = 10^{-3}$. The total (dust or gas) surface density is represented as a dark solid line in each row. Vertical dashed lines indicate the sublimation lines of the displayed species in their respective color, using $T_\mathrm{sub, CO} = 20 \mathrm{ K}$, $T_\mathrm{sub, CH_4} = 30 \mathrm{ K}$, $T_\mathrm{sub, CO_2} = 70 \mathrm{ K}$, $T_\mathrm{sub, C_2H_2} = 70 \mathrm{ K}$, $T_\mathrm{sub, H_2O} = 150 \mathrm{ K}$, and $T_\mathrm{sub, refractory} = 350 \mathrm{ K}$(see Table \ref{tab:partition_abundances}).
