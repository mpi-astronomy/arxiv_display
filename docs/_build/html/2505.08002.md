**Abstract:** The embedded phase of star formation is a crucial period in the    development of a young star as the system still accretes matter,    emerges from its natal cloud assisted by powerful jets and    outflows, and forms a disk setting the stage for the birth of a    planetary system. Mid-infrared spectral line observations, now    possible with unprecedented sensitivity, spectral resolution and    sharpness with the $_ James Webb Space Telescope_$ (JWST), are    key for probing many of the physical and chemical processes on    sub-arcsecond scales that occur in highly extincted regions,    providing unique diagnostics and complementing millimeter    observations. The JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS) program aims to    address a wide variety of questions, ranging from protostellar    accretion and the nature of primeval jets, winds and outflows, to    the chemistry of gas and ice in hot cores and cold dense    protostellar environments, and the characteristics of the embedded    disks. We introduce the program and show representative JOYS    results. JWST Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer    (MRS) Integral Field Unit (IFU) 5--28 $\mu$ m maps of 17 low-mass    targets (23 if binary components counted individually) and 6    high-mass protostellar sources are taken with resolving powers $R=\lambda/\Delta \lambda=1500-4000$ . Small mosaics ranging from $1\times 1$ to $3\times 3$ MRS tiles cover $\sim 4"$ to $20"$ fields of view, providing spectral imaging on spatial scales down    to $\sim$ 30 au (low mass) and $\sim$ 600 au (high mass). For HH    211, the complete $\sim 1'$ blue outflow lobe has been mapped with    the MRS.  Atomic lines are interpreted with published shock    models, whereas molecular lines are analyzed with simple rotation    diagrams and LTE slab models. The importance of taking infrared    pumping into account is stressed. Inferred abundance ratios are    compared with detailed hot core chemical models including    X-rays. Ice spectra are fitted through comparison with laboratory    spectra. The JWST MIRI-MRS spectra show a wide variety of features, with    their spatial distribution providing insight into their physical    origin. Atomic line maps differ among refractory (e.g., Fe),      semi-refractory (e.g., S) and volatile elements (e.g., Ne), and      are linked to their different levels of depletion and local      (shock) conditions. Jets are prominently seen in lines of [ Fe    II ] and other refractory elements whereas the pure rotational    $H_2$ lines probe hot ( $\sim 1000$ K) and warm (few $\times 10^2$ K) gas inside the cavity, associated with jets, outflows and    cavity walls, for both low- and high-mass sources.  Wide-angle    winds are found in low- $J$ $H_2$ lines. Nested, stratified jet    structures consisting of an inner ionized core with an outer    molecular layer are commonly seen in the youngest sources. [ S      I ] follows the jet as seen in [ Fe II ] in the youngest      protostars, but is different in more evolved sources where it is      concentrated on source.  Noble gas lines such as [ Ne II ] 12.8 $\mu$ m reveal a mix of jet shock and photoionized emission.  H I    recombination lines serve as a measure of protostellar accretion    rates, but are also associated with more extended jets. Gaseous    molecular emission ($CO_2$ , $C_2$ $H_2$ , HCN, $H_2$ O, $CH_4$ ,    $SO_2$ , SiO) is seen toward several sources, but is cool compared    with what is found in more evolved disks, with excitation    temperatures of only 100--250 K, and likely associated with the    warm inner envelopes ("hot cores") . $CO_2$ is often extended    along the outflow, in contrast with $C_2$ $H_2$ which is usually    centered on source. Water emission is commonly detected on source    even if relatively weak; off source it is seen only in the highest    density shocks such as associated with NGC 1333 IRAS4B. Some    sources show gaseous molecular lines in absorption, including    $NH_3$ in one case. Deep ice features are seen toward the    protostars, revealing not just the major ice components but also    ions (as part of salts) and complex organic molecules, with    comparable abundances from low- to high-mass sources. Relative    abundances of some gas and ice species are similar, consistent    with ice sublimation in hot cores. A second detection of HDO ice    in a solar-mass source is presented, with an HDO/$H_2$ O ice ratio    of $\sim$ 0.4 \% , providing a link with HDO/$H_2$ O in disks and    comets. A deep search for solid $O_2$ suggests that it is not a    significant oxygen reservoir. Only few embedded Class I disks show    the same forest of water lines as Class II disks do, possibly    caused by significant dust extinction of the upper layers due    to limited growth and settling of dust to the midplane in young    disks as well as radial drift bringing in small dust. This paper illustrates the many different science questions that a    single MIRI-MRS IFU data set can address, with significant    similarities between low- and high-mass sources. Large source    samples across evolutionary stages and luminosities are needed to    further develop these diagnostics of the physics and chemistry of    protostellar systems.

**Figure 29. -** JWST MIRI-MRS spectrum of the low-mass Class 0 protostars
  B1-c (top) and Serpens SMM3 (bottom) illustrating the different
  molecular gas (red) and ice (blue) features that can be observed and
  analyzed, tracing different components of the protostellar
  system. The inserts in the B1-c spectrum aim to highlight the
  gas-phase molecular lines in this source. Atomic emission lines are
  present but not very strong in this source. In
  contrast, both $H_2$ and atomic emission lines are very prominent
  for Serpens SMM3 (bottom). At the bottom of the silicate feature at
  10 $\mu$m, close to the noise limit, the spectra have been binned by
  a factor of 4 to enhance the $S/N$. See Fig. B.3 and B.11 of
  \citet{vanGelder24overview} for individual MIRI-MRS sub-bands. (*fig:B1c-overview*)

  protostar Serpens SMM3. The white contours in the top left panel
  indicate the dust disk seen in millimeter continuum. The red and
  blue circles on the S(4) image indicate the positions where the
  $H_2$ spectra and rotational diagrams have been extracted. Note that
  the S(3) image at 9.66 $\mu$m is strongly affected by silicate
  extinction, and the S(5) line at 6.9 $\mu$m by ice extinction, hence
  their maps are more noisy. Beam sizes are indicated in the lower
  left corner of each panel. Each panel is scaled to the maximum
  emission of that species. The maximum and minimum colors are (in Jy
  km s$^{-1}$), from top left to bottom right: S(8) (0.008, 0.003);
  S(7) (0.033, 0.007); S(6) (0.013, 0.003); S(5) (0.026, 0.003); S(4)
