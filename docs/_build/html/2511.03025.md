**Abstract:** This study explores a rare population of sources in a currently uncharted region of spectroscopic redshift space in the Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1), and is intended potentially to support upcoming spectroscopic studies.Our goal is to identify and investigate a population of sources characterised by highly ionised emission lines in their spectra, which are indicative of active galactic nucleus activity, extreme shock phenomena, or Wolf--Rayet stars.A comprehensive visual inspection of spectra is conducted to ensure the reliability of the sample, focusing on the simultaneous detection of both $\NeV$ and $\OII$ emission-line measurements, a condition that restricts the $\Euclid$ spectroscopic redshift range to $z=2.48$ --3.88.To characterise this population, we analysed the morpho-spectrophotometric properties of their host galaxies. This allowed for a direct comparison with control sources that exhibit similar $\OII$ properties and spectroscopic redshifts, but not $\NeV$ lines.We identify sources solely based on spectroscopic criteria in the redshift range beyond the $\halpha$ regime.Encompassing 65 potential $\NeV$ candidates, the resulting sample delivers the first systematic probe of these $\NeV$ candidate emitters at high redshift.We found a good agreement, within 1 $\sigma$ , between the spectral measurements calculated using both direct integration and Gaussian fitting methodologies. The $\NeV$ candidates exhibit colours similar to bright QSOs,with only a few in the tail of very red quasars.We observed a higher stellar mass content, a lower continuum around the 4000 Å break, and a similar Sérsic index distribution compared to the control sample.This unique sample paves the way for a wide range of scientific investigations, which will be pursued in the forthcoming data releases.

**Figure 1. -** Comparison of the fluxes measured via the Gaussian fit (GF, $x$-axis) and the direct integration (DI, $y$-axis) for the \NeV and \OII emission lines used in this analysis (squares and circles, respectively). QSO- and galaxy-classified \NeV emitters are plotted with red and blue symbols, respectively. The dashed line represents the $x=y$ relation. The bands represent the $\pm$1 $\sigma$ distributions of each category. (*fig:gfdi*)

**Figure 2. -** Distributions of the median stellar mass and the Sérsic index for the objects in the target sample (red) and control sample (grey). The dashed lines indicate the median value, while the vertical dotted lines and shaded bands represent the interquartile ranges(IQRs) of the distributions.
        The error bars represent the maximum dispersion in the parameters estimated via the bootstrap resampling and the IQR. The hatched bars represent the sources excluded from the analysis. (*fig:enia*)

We overplot the region proposed in \citetalias{Q1-SP027} that identifies the QSO candidates (black-solid line), with the stellar locus found below this boundary at approximately \JE$-$\HE$< 0.1$ represented by purple contours in their Fig. 6. The grey points are the compact \Euclid sources in \citetalias{Q1-SP027}. _  Bottom_: $(\YE - \HE)$ versus $(\JE - \HE)$ diagram with the region proposed in \citetalias{Q1-SP023}  that identifies the red QSO (black-dashed line). Symbols are as in the upper panel. (*fig:jhiy*)
