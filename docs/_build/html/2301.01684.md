**Abstract:** Transition disks are protoplanetary disks with inner cavities possibly cleared by massive companions. Observing them at high resolution is ideal for mapping their velocity structure and probing companion--disk interactions. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 dust and gas observations of the transition disk around RXJ1604.3–2130 A, known to feature nearly symmetric shadows in scattered light, and aim to search for non-Keplerian features. We studied the $^{12}$ CO line channel maps and moment maps of the line-of-sight velocity and peak intensity. We fitted a Keplerian model of the channel-by-channel emission to study line profile differences and produced deprojected radial profiles for all velocity components. The $^{12}$ CO emission is detected out to $R\sim$ 1.8 \arcsec (265 au). It shows a cavity inward of 0.39 \arcsec (56 au) and within the  dust continuum ring (at $\sim$ 0.56 \arcsec , i.e., 81 au).   Azimuthal brightness variations in the $^{12}$ CO line and dust continuum are broadly aligned with the shadows detected in scattered-light observations. We find a strong localized non-Keplerian feature toward the west within the continuum ring (at ${R=41\pm10}$ au and ${PA=280\pm2^\circ}$ ). It accounts for $\Delta v_\phi/v_\mathrm{kep}\sim0.4$ or $\Delta v_z/v_\mathrm{kep}\sim0.04$ , depending on if the perturbation is in the rotational or vertical direction.   A tightly wound spiral is also detected and extends over $300^\circ$ in azimuth, possibly connected to the localized non-Keplerian  feature. Finally, a bending of the iso-velocity contours within the gas cavity indicates a highly perturbed inner region, possibly related to the presence of a misaligned inner disk. While broadly aligned with the scattered-light shadows, the localized non-Keplerian feature cannot be solely due to changes in temperature. Instead, we interpret the kinematical feature as tracing a massive companion located at the edge of the dust continuum ring. We speculate that the spiral is caused by buoyancy resonances driven by planet--disk interactions.   However, this potential planet at $\sim$ 41 au cannot explain the gas-depleted cavity, the low accretion rate, and the misaligned inner disk, which suggests the presence of another companion closer in.

**Figure 10. -** ALMA observations of J1604. Panel **(a)**: 231 GHz dust continuum. The solid black contours are drawn at [5, 15, 25, 35, 45]$\sigma$, and the image is plotted with a power-law scaling of $\gamma=0.6$. Panel **(b)**: $^{12}$CO peak brightness temperature map computed from $I_\mathrm{0}$ using the Planck law with black solid contours drawn at [5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 65, 70]$\sigma$. Pixels below $5\sigma$ are masked. Panel **(c)**: Peak intensity residuals after subtracting an azimuthally averaged radial profile from the data. We have adjusted the color scale such that residuals smaller than $1\sigma$ are white. The beam sizes are shown in the lower-left corner, and the position of the star is marked by a green cross. In panels **(b)** and **(c)**, we have overlaid the continuum contours in white and black, respectively. (*fig:intensities*)

**Figure 11. -** Line-of-sight velocity maps for $v_\mathrm{0}$ data **(a)** and the \texttt{discminer} model, $v_\mathrm{mod}$**(b)**. Panel **(c)**: Velocity residual map after subtracting $v_\mathrm{mod}$ from $v_\mathrm{0}$. The dust continuum is overlaid in solid contours with equal levels, as in Fig. \ref{fig:intensities}. The innermost region was masked during the fit by one beam size in radius, shown as the gray shaded ellipse. The insets in panels **(a)** and **(c)** zoom into the innermost region of the disk to highlight the non-Keplerian velocities. Contours are drawn at v$_\mathrm{sys}=(4.62 $± 0.60) \kmsec in steps of 0.1 \kmsec and from -60 to 60 \msec in steps of 10 \msec, respectively. All maps show the synthesized beam for CO (black) and the continuum (white) in the lower-left corner.  The beams are masked where the CO peak intensity falls below the 5$\sigma$ level for panel **(a) **and where $R>R_\mathrm{out}$ for the rest. (*fig:centroid*)

**Figure 8. -** Location of the folded peak velocity residuals. The detected points are shown in azimuth (left) and radius (middle) and were obtained using the peak variance method. Colors indicate the seven different radial clusters specified, where blue peak residual points are within a detected significant radial cluster. The black crosses are the velocity variances of the clusters plotted at the ($R,\phi$) location of each cluster center. The centers of the accepted clusters (those with peak velocity residuals larger than three times the variance in other clusters) in radius and azimuth are marked with vertical black lines in both panels. The right-hand plot shows the normal distribution of the peak residual points in a histogram. Note that outliers of the distribution are related to the localized perturbation. The maximum value of all peak folded centroid residuals is at 0.39$\arcsec$(57 au), its mean value is 39 m/s, and $1\sigma_v=20$ m/s (not to be mistaken with the cluster variances).
