$Quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signals are discovered in some fast radio bursts (FRBs) such as FRB 20191221A, as well as in the X-ray burst associated with the galactic FRB from SGR 1935+2154.$
$We revisit the intermediate-field FRB model where the radio waves are generated as fast-magnetosonic waves through magnetic reconnection near the light cylinder.$
$The current sheet in the magnetar wind is compressed by a low frequency pulse emitted from the inner magnetosphere to trigger magnetic reconnection.$
$By incorporating the wave dynamics of the magnetosphere, we demonstrate how the FRB frequency, the single pulse width, and luminosity are determined by the period, magnetic field, QPO frequency and quake energetics of the magnetar.$
$We find that this model can naturally and self-consistently interpret the X-ray/radio event from SGR 1935+2154 and the QPO in FRB 20191221A.$
$It can also explain the observed wide energy range of repeating FRBs in a narrow bandwidth.$

$\section{Introduction}$
$In recent years, the study of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been greatly advanced by the progress in the observations.$
$New detections of the galactic events \citep{CHIME2020Naturmagnetar,Bochenek2020Natur}, burst polarisation \citep[e.g.][]{Michilli2018,Luo2020Natur}, burst morphology \citep[e.g.][]{Pleunis2021ApJ}, source periodicity \citep[e.g.][]{Chime2020NaturPeriod,Pastor-Marazuela2021Natur,CHIME2022Natur}, source activity \citep[e.g.][]{Li2021Natur} and host galaxies \citep[e.g.][]{Bassa2017ApJL,Bhandari2022AJ}, have led to constraints on both progenitor models and radiation mechanisms.$
$However, a complete theoretical understanding of fast radio bursts is still not available and requires more effort \citep[see][for recent reviews]{Zhang2020Natur,Xiao2021SCPMA}.$
$Highly magnetised compact objects are usually involved as the central engine of FRBs, such as magnetars, pulsars, and accreting black holes. Among them, the magnetar scenario has been confirmed by the detection of the galactic event \citep{CHIME2020Naturmagnetar,Bochenek2020Natur,Li2021NatAs,Mereghetti2020ApJL,Ridnaia2021NatAs,Tavani2021NatAs}.$
$Theoretically, the energy resource can come from the internal magnetic energy of magnetars \citep[e.g.][]{Popov2013,Katz2016,Beloborodov2017,Margalit2020ApJL} or the gravitational potential energy when a companion star is involved \citep[e.g.][]{Wang2016,Dai2016,Wang2018,Zhang2020ApJL,Dai2020ApJL,Most2022MNRAS}.$
$Currently, the mainstream FRB radiation mechanisms can be divided into two categories: the near-field (or close-in) and the far-field (or far-away) model.$
$The near-field model, mainly based on the coherent curvature radiation model near the magnetar surface \citep[e.g.][]{Kumar2017,Yang2018,Lu2020MNRAS,WangFY2020ApJ,Yang2020ApJL,WangWY2020ApJ}, can explain the complex temporal behavior of FRBs, while the bunching mechanism for the coherent curvature radiation is unclear.$
$The far-field model incorporates the synchrotron maser emission at the shock front far from the magnetosphere as the coherent radio emission mechanism  \citep[e.g.][]{Lyubarsky2014,Beloborodov2017,Margalit2018,Waxman2017,Metzger2019MNRAS,Beloborodov2020ApJ,Plotnikov2019,Margalit2020ApJL,Wu2020ApJL,Xiao2020ApJL}.$
$This mechanism has been demonstrated using kinetic plasma simulations \citep[e.g.][]{Plotnikov2019,Sironi2021PhRvL}.$
$However, it is difficult to explain the sub-second scale quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) from FRBs \citep{CHIME2022Natur,Pastor-Marazuela2022arXiv}.$
$It is also found that neither model can fully explain the X-ray/radio event from SGR 1935+2154 \citep{Wang2020ApJ}.$
$Recently, a new type of FRB model is proposed where an FRB is radiated as fast-magnetosonic (FMS) waves generated from violent magnetic reconnection triggered by a low-frequency pulse (LFP) compressing the current sheet \citep{Lyubarsky2020ApJ}.$
$As the coherent radio emission is produced near the light cylinder, we refer to it as the "intermediate-field" model.$
$Kinetic plasma simulations \citep{Philippov2019,Mahlmann2022ApJL} have successfully demonstrated the emission of coherent FMS waves through this mechanism.$
$It is also found that the high linear polarisation \citep{Lyubarsky2020ApJ} and the downward frequency drifting \citep{Mahlmann2022ApJL} can be well explained.$
$However, the predicted frequency is significantly lower than the observation of the SGR 1935+2154 event \citep{Wang2020ApJ}.$
$In this paper, we revisit the intermediate-field model and propose that the LFP is produced through nonlinear conversion of Alfv\'en waves, which further leads to the generation of QPOs.$
$In section \ref{sec:radiation_injection}, we briefly review the coherent radiation mechanism from magnetic reconnection.$
$In section \ref{sec:FRB_QPO}, we study the injection of energy through Alfv\'en waves, the wave dynamics in the magnetosphere, and the generation of FRBs and QPOs.$
$In section \ref{sec:explainQPO}, we apply our model to observations.$
$The conclusion and discussion are presented in section \ref{sec:conclusion}.$
$Throughout this paper we adopt the shorthand X=X_n\times 10^n to describe the normalization of quantity X in cgs units.$

$\section{Reconnection Driven Coherent Radio Emission}\label{sec:radiation_injection}$
$Magnetic reconnection is a process of changing the magnetic topology when two oppositely directed magnetic field lines approach each other forming a current sheet at the centre.$
$The onset of magnetic reconnection is triggered when the current sheet becomes tearing or kink unstable and breaks into a self-similar chain of plasmoids extending down to the kinetic scale \citep{Uzdensky2010PhRvL}.$
$Fast magnetic reconnection proceeds when the plasmoids collide and merge into larger islands.$
$During the coalescence of plasmoids, magnetic energy is dissipated and FMS waves are produced.$
$In highly magnetized systems with magnetization parameter \sigma\equiv B^2/4\pi \rho c^2 \gg1, FMS waves have similar dispersion relation as vacuum electromagnetic waves \citep{Thompson1998,Li2019} and can convert to coherent radio waves \citep[e.g.][]{Lyubarsky2019,Philippov2019,Lyubarsky2020ApJ}.$
$\cite{Lyubarsky2020ApJ} proposed that the coherent emission of FRBs are GHz FMS waves generated by the plasmoid collision during magnetic reconnection.$
$In their picture, the current sheets in the magnetar wind are compressed by an external outgoing LFP and become tearing unstable under the perturbation, and magnetic reconnection is  initiated.$
$Coherent FMS waves are produced in the reconnection and can escape as fast radio bursts.$
$Kinetic simulations by \citet{Mahlmann2022ApJL} have confirmed this process and found that FMS waves takes only a small fraction of the reconnection energy.$
$The characteristic frequency of the coherent FMS waves is determined by the size of the plasmoid \lambda'_c. Note we use the primed symbols to mark parameters measured in the co-moving frame of the plasma throughout the paper.$
$In the plasma comoving frame, \omega'_c \approx c/ \lambda'_c.$
$The typical plasmoid size is found to be proportional to the width of the current sheet \lambda'_c=\varsigma a' with \varsigma\sim10-100 \citep{Philippov2019,Lyubarsky2020ApJ}, and the width depends on the Larmor radius a'=\varpi r_{\rm L} with \varpi being a few.$
$\cite{Lyubarsky2020ApJ} gave the expression of the plasmoid size by balancing the pressure and energy,$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$    \lambda'_c=\sqrt{\frac{8\pi\beta_{\rm rec}\varpi}{e\sigma_T}}\frac{m_ec^2}{B'^{3/2}},$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$where \sigma_T is the Thomson scattering cross section, \beta_{\rm rec}\sim0.1 is the reconnection rate, B'=B/\Gamma is the magnetic field in the comoving frame and \Gamma is the bulk Lorentz factor.$
$Therefore, the characteristic frequency in the observer's frame is,$
$\beq$
$\nu_{\rm c}\equiv\Gamma\omega'_c/2\pi\approx 2.1 \eta_1^{-1} \Gamma^{-1/2} B_{8}^{3/2}~{\rm GHz},\label{Eq:nuc}$
$\eeq$
$where \eta\equiv\varsigma \varpi^{1/2}\beta_{\rm rec}^{1/2}.$
$This expression is confirmed numerically by \cite{Mahlmann2022ApJL} but with a slightly different expression of \eta.$

$\section{Intermediate-field FRB models and QPOs}\label{sec:FRB_QPO}$
$\subsection{Energy injection via Alfv\'en waves}$
$For a magnetar with a surface dipole magnetic field B_d and radius R_*\approx10^6 cm, the total magnetic energy is E_{B}=B_d^2R_{*}^3/6\approx1.7\times10^{47}\Bc^2 erg.$
$The internal magnetic field B_* can be higher and we parameterize it by B_*= \zeta B_d with \zeta>1.$
$The internal magnetic energy can be released by a sudden starquake and crustal motion which are accompanied by the crustal shear oscillations \citep[e.g.][]{Thompson1995MNRAS,Thompson2001,Duncan1998ApJL}.$
$Such oscillations are proposed to explain the QPOs observed in magnetar X-ray flares \citep[e.g.][]{Israel2005,Strohmayer2005,Strohmayer2006ApJ}.$
$As the shear wave propagates in the crust, it shakes the anchored magnetic field lines, and launches Alfv\'en waves into the magnetosphere \citep{Thompson2001,Li2016,Thompson2017,Bransgrove2020}.$
$The Alfv\'en waves carry energy into the magnetosphere and propagate along the field lines,$
$as sketched in Fig.~\ref{fig:magnetar_model}.$
$The field-line equation is r=R\sin^2{\theta}, where R is the maximum distance of the field line to the magnetar center and \theta is the angle to the magnetic axis.$
$For field lines with R\gg R_*, the field-line length is l\simeq\pi R/2.$
$The generated Alfv\'en waves of frequency \fa in the magnetosphere can propagate along field lines with l\geq l_0=\pi R_0/2=c/\fa=1.9\times10^{10}\fa^{-1}~{\rm cm} as a perturbation.$
$Note that Alfv\'en waves travelling on field lines with l<l_0 may suffer strong nonlinear interaction and the dissipation mechanism is unclear. Thus we only consider magnetar quakes occurred near the magnetic polar region, so that magnetar oscillations can launch Alfv\'en waves into the magnetosphere before damping \citep[e.g.][]{Levin2007MNRAS,Hoven2012}.$
$We consider a sudden release of internal magnetic energy of E_q=h S B_*^2/8\pi in the crust with a crust thickness h\approx10^5 cm and an area S_q.$
$The magnetar quake can simultaneously launch a number of waves with different frequencies, that are of different damping time-scales \citep[e.g.][]{Levin2007MNRAS,Hoven2012,Gabler2016MNRAS}.$
$We assume that the Alfv\'en wave of frequency f_A is the dominated one, and a number (n_A) of waves at this frequency has been excited.$
$The energy carried by each wave is parameterized as \epsilon E_q\approx L_A/f_A with a power L_A and \epsilon<1/n_A.$
$The wave is launched from the magnetar surface within the same area,$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$    S_q=2.5\times10^8\lac\fac^{-1}\Bc^{-2}\epsilon^{-1}\zeta^{-2} {\rm cm}^2.$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$The corresponding wave amplitude in the magnetosphere is {\delta B}=\sqrt{8\pi L_A/S_qc}.$
$Its relative amplitude to the background field near the magnetar surface is$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$    \frac{\delta B}{B_d}\approx 0.02\fac^{1/2}\epsilon^{1/2}\zeta,$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$As the Alfv\'en wave propagates in the magnetosphere, its amplitude grows as {\delta B}/{B_d}\propto r^{3/2} \citep[e.g.][]{Kumar2020,Yuan2020}.$
$When the relative amplitude grows to {\delta B}/{ B}\approx1 \citep{Yuan2020,Yuan2022ApJ} at a distance of$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$   R_{\rm m}\approx 1.4\times 10^7\fac^{-1/3}\epsilon^{-1/3}\zeta^{-2/3}~\rm{cm},$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$the Alfv\'en waves will become nonlinear and shear the magnetosphere.$
$The background magnetic field here can be estimated from a dipole B_{\rm m}=B_*R_*^3R_{\rm m}^{-3}.$
$Under the strong shear, the magnetosphere becomes unstable.$
$A large part of the Alfv\'en waves will be converted to FMS waves that propagates outwards radially in the form of a LFP \citep{Yuan2021} due to the interaction with the curved magnetic field line.$
$The remaining Alfv\'en waves will dissipate inside the magnetosphere by nonlinear instabilities \citep{Yuan2020} or absorbed by the magnetar \citep{Li2015}.$
$Self interactions among multiple Alfv\'en waves can enhance the wave dissipation through turbulence cascade, increasing fast wave conversion rate \citep{Li2019} or leading to fast dissipation \citep{Li2021}.$
$\vspace{-5pt}$
$\subsection{Generation of FRBs}$
$An illustration for the generation of FRBs is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:magnetar_model}.$
$During the propagation of the LFP at r>R_{\rm m}, its toroidal field follows rB_{\rm LFP } = B_{\rm LFP, m}R_{\rm m} with B_{\rm LFP, m}\approx B_{\rm m} \citep{Yuan2020,Yuan2022ApJ}.$
$As the energy contained in the LFP is higher than that of background field, the magnetosphere is distorted.$
$The poloidal field follows r^2 B_p= B_{\rm m}R_{\rm m}^{2} from the conservation of magnetic flux.$
$Thus the magnetosphere at R>R_{\rm m} can be treated as a split monopole \citep{Parfrey2013,Yuan2020,Yuan2022ApJ}.$
$When the LFP propagates beyond the light cylinder at R_L=c P/2\pi, where P is the magnetar rotation period, it enters the magnetar wind zone.$
$The toroidal field of the LFP and the poloidal field of the magnetosphere at the light cylinder are$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$    B_{\rm LFP, L}=3.4\times10^8\Bc\fac^{2/3}\epsilon^{2/3}\zeta^{4/3}\left(\frac{P}{3 {\rm s}}\right)^{-1} \rm{G}\label{eq:bphi_LC};\B_{p,m}(R_{\rm L})=3.4\times10^5\Bc\fac^{1/3}\epsilon^{1/3}\zeta^{2/3}\left(\frac{P}{3 {\rm s}}\right)^{-2} \rm{G}.\label{eq:bpol_LC}$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$The LFP compresses the striped wind and accelerates the plasma to a bulk Lorentz factor of \Gamma\approx0.5\sqrt{B_{\rm LFP, L}/B_{\rm w}(R_{\rm L}) }, where the wind field is described as a monopole with B_{\rm w}(r)=B_{p}(R_L)R_L/r and B_{p}(R_L) is the poloidal field of the magnetosphere at the light cylinder.$
$The pulse front propagates into the magnetar wind launched by the unperturbed magnetosphere with B_{p}(R_L)=B_*R_*^3R_{\rm L}^{-3}.$
$However, the energy carried by the LFP amplifies the magnetic field at the light cylinder to B_{p,m}(R_{\rm L}) \citep{Yuan2020,Yuan2022ApJ}, which further enhances the toroidal magnetic field in the striped wind to B_{\rm w}(R_{\rm L})\sim B_{p,m}(R_{\rm L}).$
$Therefore, the rear part of LFP will interact with the current sheets in the striped wind launched by the perturbed magnetosphere (see. Fig. \ref{fig:magnetar_model}).$
$In reality, the amplification of the wind toroidal field is highly dynamic, we therefore expect the wind field to be in the range B_{\rm w}(R_{\rm L})\in[B_*R_*^3R_{\rm L}^{-3},\; B_{p,m}(R_{\rm L})].$
$The corresponding maximum and minimum Lorentz factors of the accelerated LFPs are then$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$    &&\Gamma^{\rm max}=496 \epsilon^{1/3}\zeta^{2/3}\fac^{1/3}\left(\frac{P}{3 {\rm s}}\right);\\\nonumber$
$    &&\Gamma^{\rm min}=16 \epsilon^{1/6}\zeta^{1/3}\fac^{1/6}\left(\frac{P}{3 {\rm s}}\right)^{1/2}.\label{eq.Gamma}$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$In the following we parameterize \Gamma=100\Gc which lies between \Gamma^{\rm min} and \Gamma^{\rm max}.$
$And we expect \Gamma\rightarrow\Gamma^{\rm min} for LFPs consisting of multiple waves (e.g. n_A\gtrsim3), such as in the SGR 1935+2154 event and FRB 20191221A (see Sec. \ref{sec:explainQPO} for more details).$
$The LFP compresses the current sheet in the striped wind, which triggers magnetic reconnection and leads to the generation of high-frequency FMS waves \citep{Lyubarsky2020ApJ,Mahlmann2022ApJL}.$
$Substituting B_{\rm LFP,L} and \Gamma into Eq.~(\ref{Eq:nuc}), we obtain the frequency of the FMS waves,$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$    \nuc=1.3\fac\Bc^{3/2}\epsilon\zeta^2\left(\frac{P}{3 {\rm s}}\right)^{-3/2}\eta_1^{-1}\Gc^{-1/2} \rm{GHz},\label{eq:nu_final}$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$which lies in the radio band.$
$The produced FMS waves suffers from nonlinear interactions in the magnetosphere that may prevent it from escaping.$
$We can estimate the optical depth of the nonlinear interactions for the FMS waves following \citet{Lyubarsky2020ApJ},$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$    \tau_{\rm NL}\sim \frac{\kappa 2\pi\nu R_{\rm L}}{2\Gamma^2c}=0.5\kappa_{-5.5}\ncc\left(\frac{P}{3 {\rm s}}\right)\Gc^{-2},$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$where \kappa=\Bfms^2/B_{\rm LFP, L}^2 is the energy ratio of the high-frequency FMS waves to the LFP. In 2D simulations, it is found that a fraction \kappa\sim10^{-4} of energy from the LFP is converted to the FMS, interpreted as an upper limit of the efficiency \citep{Mahlmann2022ApJL}.$
$The ratio of radio to X-ray energy of FRB200428 is found to be 10^{-6}-10^{-5} \citep{Ridnaia2021NatAs}.$
$Here we take \kappa\sim10^{-5.5} to be the fiducial value.$
$Therefore, the FMS waves generated at the light cylinder can escape the magnetosphere without significant dissipation and be observed as FRBs.$
$There are also current sheets behind the LFP inside the magnetosphere, which has been suggested to produce an FRB \citep{Wang2020ApJ,Yuan2020,Yuan2022ApJ}.$
$However, we would argue below that the FMS waves produced behind the LFP cannot be the primary source of FRB.$
$On one hand, FMS waves emitted deep inside the magnetosphere suffers from strong dissipation due to the nonlinear interactions.$
$The optical depth inside the magnetosphere is \tau_{\rm NL}\approx({\Bfms}/{B_p})^2\omega R/c \citep[see Eq. A3 in][]{Lyubarsky2020ApJ} with the FMS wave magnetic field {\Bfms}=\sqrt{2L_{\rm FMS}/ r^2} and B_p being treated as a monopole.$
$Setting \tau_{\rm NL}\sim10, we obtain a mean-free-path$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$\ell\sim6.1\times10^7\Bc^{1/2}\fac^{1/6}\epsilon^{1/6}\zeta^{1/3}\ncc^{-1/4}L_{\rm FMS,42}^{-1/4} {\rm cm},$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$which is much smaller than R_L for a typical magnetar with period 0.1-10~s.$
$On the other hand, the reconnection of the current sheet behind the LFP is supported by the reversed poloidal magnetic field \citep{Yuan2022ApJ}.$
$Near the light cylinder where the produced FMS can escape, we can estimate$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$    \frac{B_{p,m}^2(R_{\rm L})}{B_{\rm LFP, L}^2}=1.0\times10^{-6}\fac^{-2/3}\epsilon^{-2/3}\zeta^{-4/3}\left(\frac{P}{3 {\rm s}}\right)^{-2}.$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$The magnetic energy here is much smaller than the energy of the LFP, therefore the escaping FMS wave must be dominated by those generated in the striped wind.$
$\vspace{-5pt}$
$\subsection{QPOs in FRBs}$
$The LFP is made up of low-frequency FMS waves converted from the propagating Alfv\'en waves.$
$This process can be viewed as the nonlinear interaction between Alfv\'en waves and the curved background magnetic field.$
$The leading order wave interaction is the three-wave interaction with the frequency of FMS wave given by f_{\rm LFP}=f_A+f_{\rm bg}.$
$As the background magnetic field can be viewed as a large scale perturbation, i.e. f_{\rm bg}\approx 0, the resulting LFP wave will have the same frequency as the Alfv\'en wave f_{\rm LFP}\approx \fa.$
$The LFP propagates outward radially with its thickness conserved as found by numerical simulations \citep{Yuan2022ApJ}. Therefore the LFP frequency remains constant.$
$The energy dissipation of the magnetic reconnection at the light cylinder will be mediated by this LFP wave frequency, so that we expect$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$    \ffrb\sim f_{\rm LFP}\approx\fa.$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$Note in this expression, we assume \fa>1/P, which will in general be satisfied for magnetars with P\gtrsim0.1 s. Otherwise the FRB profile will also be modulated by the spin period.$
$The LFP accelerates during the propagation to the light cylinder.$
$Therefore the observed width of one single pulse and peak luminosity is$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$    W_{\rm p}\approx1/(\Gamma\fa),\label{eq:tpulse}\L_{\rm FMS}\approx\kappa L_A \Gamma\label{eq:lfrb}.$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$The frequency of Alfv\'en waves depends on the magnetar properties.$
$\cite{Duncan1998ApJL} studied the shear wave in the magnetar crust and found that the frequency of toroidal modes with the lowest radial node (symbolized by _lt_0) follows \fa(_lt_0)\approx12.2l^{1/2}(l+1)^{1/2} \rm{Hz} with l\geq2 being an integer \citep{Duncan1998ApJL}.$
$Later it is found that the crustal shear modes would couple with the MHD modes of the magnetar core, and the frequency and duration of the oscillation will be modified \citep[e.g.][]{Levin2007MNRAS,Hoven2012,Gabler2016MNRAS}.$
$Such theories indicate that the fundamental frequency of magnetar QPOs can be as low as a few Hz, and it can be much higher for high order overtones, even up to a few kHz \citep[e.g.][]{Hoven2012}.$
$The observed QPO signals in FRBs will be dominated by one or several major frequencies which carries most of the energy, and the FRB light curve is made by their superposition.$
$\vspace{-5pt}$
$\section{Application to the observed QPOs and the SGR 1935+2154 event}\label{sec:explainQPO}$
$Observations show that the FRB from the galactic magnetar, SGR 1935+2154 \citep{CHIME2020Naturmagnetar,Bochenek2020Natur}, is associated with a hard X-ray burst by several X-ray instruments\citep{Li2021NatAs,Mereghetti2020ApJL,Ridnaia2021NatAs,Tavani2021NatAs}.$
$This magnetar is of spin period and surface magnetic field P=3.2 s and B_*=2.2\times10^{14} G respectively \citep{Olausen2014,Israel2016}.$
$Two radio pulses separated by 30 ms are found in this FRB, while more pulses are detected in X-ray bands.$
$Especially, a QPO of \fa\approx40 Hz and n_A\gtrsim8 is detected in the X-ray light curve by the Insight-HXMT \citep{Li2022ApJ}.$
$The observed pulse width is 0.3-0.6 ms ms by CHIME and STARE2 in 0.6-1.3 GHz \citep{CHIME2020Naturmagnetar,Bochenek2020Natur}.$
$Substituting \epsilon<1/n_A\sim1/8, W_{\rm p}\sim0.5 ms, and  \nuc\sim1 GHz as well as the observed radio peak luminosity L_{\rm FMS}\approx10^{38} erg/s \citep{Bochenek2020Natur,Zhou2020ApJ} into Eqs. (\ref{eq:nu_final}, \ref{eq:tpulse} and \ref{eq:lfrb}), we obtain \Gamma\sim50, \zeta\gtrsim11\eta_1^{1/2} and L_A\approx 6\times10^{41} \kappa_{-5.5}^{-1} erg/s.$
$The required \Gamma is in the allowed range [22\eta_1^{1/6}, 977\eta_1^{1/3}] from Eq. (\ref{eq.Gamma}).$
$And the required L_A is higher than the observed X-ray luminosity, 1.1\times10^{41}~erg/s \citep{Ridnaia2021NatAs}.$
$Therefore, our model can explain this event self-consistently.$
$QPO signals are also observed in individual FRB events, such as the 4.6 Hz QPO in FRB 20191221A, 357.1 Hz in FRB 20210206A, 93.4 Hz in FRB 20210213A detected by CHIME \citep{CHIME2022Natur}, and the 2.4 kHz QPO in FRB 20201020A detected by Apertif \citep{Pastor-Marazuela2022arXiv}.$
$The observed QPOs with frequencies larger than 93.4 Hz mentioned above can be explained by the overtones in a wide parameter range. While the 4.6 Hz QPO in FRB 20191221A may relate to the fundamental mode. We here focus on this source, which has the highest significance \citep{CHIME2022Natur}.$
$The observed radio frequency, single pulse width, and QPO frequency of FRB 20191221A are \nuc\approx0.7 GHz, W_{\rm p}\approx4 ms, and f_A\approx4.6 Hz with n_A\approx9, respectively.$
$The total duration of this event is \sim3 s and we would expect P>3 s so that the QPO signal is not contaminated by the magnetar rotation.$
$Substituting them into Eqs. (\ref{eq:nu_final} and \ref{eq:tpulse}), we obtain \Gamma=54 and \zeta\gtrsim9\eta_1^{1/2}(P/3 {\rm s})^{3/4}\Bc^{-3/4}.$
$The required \Gamma is in the allowed range [14\eta_1^{1/6}(P/3 {\rm s})^{3/4}\Bc^{-1/4},367\eta_1^{1/3}(P/3 {\rm s})^{3/2}\Bc^{-1/2}].$
$Thus the QPO in FRB 20191221A can also be explained by our model.$

$\section{Conclusion and Discussion}\label{sec:conclusion}$
$In this paper we revisited the intermediate-field FRB model and studied the QPOs.$
$The launch of Alfv\'en waves into the magnetosphere generates an LFP, which is made up of FMS waves at approximately the same frequencies of Alfv\'en waves (\fa).$
$This further generates FRBs when the LFP dissipates its energy at the current sheet near the light cylinder.$
$The FRB light curve is thus modulated by the frequency of the LFP, exhibiting QPOs at a frequency \sim\fa.$
$The major difference of our calculations from \cite{Lyubarsky2020ApJ} is the treatment of magnetic field configurations of the LFP and the magnetar wind, as we considered the wave dynamics in the magnetosphere.$
$The FRB frequency (Eq. \ref{eq:nu_final}), the single pulse width (Eq. \ref{eq:tpulse}), and luminosity (Eq. \ref{eq:lfrb}) depend mainly on the magnetar's period and magnetic field and the quake energetics and QPO frequency.$
$For the dynamics in the magnetosphere and the compressed striped wind, numerical simulations \citep{Yu2020,Yuan2022ApJ,Mahlmann2022ApJL} have improved the understanding of the related parameters.$
$Therefore, the major uncertainties mainly come from two quake energetic parameters (\epsilon and \zeta), which requires further studies for a better understanding.$
$With physically reasonable values for these two parameters, we find that this model can naturally and self-consistently interpret the observed frequency, pulse width, luminosity and QPO signal of the radio/X-ray event from SGR 1935+2154 and FRB 20191221A.$
$Our model can also naturally explain the observed wide energy span detected in a relative narrow frequency band, such as the broad energy range (4\times10^{36}-8\times10^{39} erg) observed in FRB 121102 at 1.25 GHz \citep{Li2021Natur}, as the frequency does not depend on the flare energy apparently.$
$And in certain parameter space for young magnetars, the frequency is in the optical band, indicating the possibility of producing fast optical transients.$
$In general, QPOs will modulate the FRB light curve. Direct identification of QPOs may require at least around ten individual pulses (n_A\gtrsim10) in one event \citep[e.g.][]{CHIME2022Natur}.$
$For the high-frequency QPOs (\fa\gtrsim1 kHz), the corresponding FRB pulses may overlap with each other, making it difficult to identify from the data.$
$While for the low-frequency QPOs (\fa\sim10 Hz), one may only expect to detect them from magnetars with P\gtrsim10/\fa\sim1 s so that the QPO signal is not contaminated by the magnetar spin.$
$For repeating FRBs, QPOs would affect the waiting time distribution even if only several pulses are presented in the observed individual events.$
$The peak at 3.4 ms in the waiting time distribution of FRB 121102 may be such a case \citep{Li2021Natur}.$
$As only a small portion of energy is dissipated to power FRBs, the majority of the energy will be dissipated into X-rays or carried by the ejecta.$
$The ejecta would further power an afterglow or a nebula \citep[e.g.][]{Waxman2017,Beloborodov2017,Margalit2018,WangLai2020}.$
$As magnetar flares may eject a large fraction of mass \citep[e.g.][]{Granot2006ApJ}, high-energy cosmic rays can also be produced in such afterglows/nebulae.$
$Besides, such a magnetic reconnection process could also take place in neutron star mergers \citep[e.g.][]{Wang2018,Most2022MNRAS} and accreting black holes \citep[e.g.][]{Beloborodov2017ApJ,Sridhar2021MNRAS}, thus we might also expect such reconnection driven transients from neutron star mergers, X-ray binaries, or active galactic nuclei.$

$Quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signals are discovered in some fast radio bursts (FRBs) such as FRB 20191221A, as well as in the X-ray burst associated with the galactic FRB from SGR 1935+2154.$
$We revisit the intermediate-field FRB model where the radio waves are generated as fast-magnetosonic waves through magnetic reconnection near the light cylinder.$
$The current sheet in the magnetar wind is compressed by a low frequency pulse emitted from the inner magnetosphere to trigger magnetic reconnection.$
$By incorporating the wave dynamics of the magnetosphere, we demonstrate how the FRB frequency, the single pulse width, and luminosity are determined by the period, magnetic field, QPO frequency and quake energetics of the magnetar.$
$We find that this model can naturally and self-consistently interpret the X-ray/radio event from SGR 1935+2154 and the QPO in FRB 20191221A.$
$It can also explain the observed wide energy range of repeating FRBs in a narrow bandwidth.$

$\section{Introduction}$
$In recent years, the study of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been greatly advanced by the progress in the observations.$
$New detections of the galactic events \citep{CHIME2020Naturmagnetar,Bochenek2020Natur}, burst polarisation \citep[e.g.][]{Michilli2018,Luo2020Natur}, burst morphology \citep[e.g.][]{Pleunis2021ApJ}, source periodicity \citep[e.g.][]{Chime2020NaturPeriod,Pastor-Marazuela2021Natur,CHIME2022Natur}, source activity \citep[e.g.][]{Li2021Natur} and host galaxies \citep[e.g.][]{Bassa2017ApJL,Bhandari2022AJ}, have led to constraints on both progenitor models and radiation mechanisms.$
$However, a complete theoretical understanding of fast radio bursts is still not available and requires more effort \citep[see][for recent reviews]{Zhang2020Natur,Xiao2021SCPMA}.$
$Highly magnetised compact objects are usually involved as the central engine of FRBs, such as magnetars, pulsars, and accreting black holes. Among them, the magnetar scenario has been confirmed by the detection of the galactic event \citep{CHIME2020Naturmagnetar,Bochenek2020Natur,Li2021NatAs,Mereghetti2020ApJL,Ridnaia2021NatAs,Tavani2021NatAs}.$
$Theoretically, the energy resource can come from the internal magnetic energy of magnetars \citep[e.g.][]{Popov2013,Katz2016,Beloborodov2017,Margalit2020ApJL} or the gravitational potential energy when a companion star is involved \citep[e.g.][]{Wang2016,Dai2016,Wang2018,Zhang2020ApJL,Dai2020ApJL,Most2022MNRAS}.$
$Currently, the mainstream FRB radiation mechanisms can be divided into two categories: the near-field (or close-in) and the far-field (or far-away) model.$
$The near-field model, mainly based on the coherent curvature radiation model near the magnetar surface \citep[e.g.][]{Kumar2017,Yang2018,Lu2020MNRAS,WangFY2020ApJ,Yang2020ApJL,WangWY2020ApJ}, can explain the complex temporal behavior of FRBs, while the bunching mechanism for the coherent curvature radiation is unclear.$
$The far-field model incorporates the synchrotron maser emission at the shock front far from the magnetosphere as the coherent radio emission mechanism  \citep[e.g.][]{Lyubarsky2014,Beloborodov2017,Margalit2018,Waxman2017,Metzger2019MNRAS,Beloborodov2020ApJ,Plotnikov2019,Margalit2020ApJL,Wu2020ApJL,Xiao2020ApJL}.$
$This mechanism has been demonstrated using kinetic plasma simulations \citep[e.g.][]{Plotnikov2019,Sironi2021PhRvL}.$
$However, it is difficult to explain the sub-second scale quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) from FRBs \citep{CHIME2022Natur,Pastor-Marazuela2022arXiv}.$
$It is also found that neither model can fully explain the X-ray/radio event from SGR 1935+2154 \citep{Wang2020ApJ}.$
$Recently, a new type of FRB model is proposed where an FRB is radiated as fast-magnetosonic (FMS) waves generated from violent magnetic reconnection triggered by a low-frequency pulse (LFP) compressing the current sheet \citep{Lyubarsky2020ApJ}.$
$As the coherent radio emission is produced near the light cylinder, we refer to it as the "intermediate-field" model.$
$Kinetic plasma simulations \citep{Philippov2019,Mahlmann2022ApJL} have successfully demonstrated the emission of coherent FMS waves through this mechanism.$
$It is also found that the high linear polarisation \citep{Lyubarsky2020ApJ} and the downward frequency drifting \citep{Mahlmann2022ApJL} can be well explained.$
$However, the predicted frequency is significantly lower than the observation of the SGR 1935+2154 event \citep{Wang2020ApJ}.$
$In this paper, we revisit the intermediate-field model and propose that the LFP is produced through nonlinear conversion of Alfv\'en waves, which further leads to the generation of QPOs.$
$In section \ref{sec:radiation_injection}, we briefly review the coherent radiation mechanism from magnetic reconnection.$
$In section \ref{sec:FRB_QPO}, we study the injection of energy through Alfv\'en waves, the wave dynamics in the magnetosphere, and the generation of FRBs and QPOs.$
$In section \ref{sec:explainQPO}, we apply our model to observations.$
$The conclusion and discussion are presented in section \ref{sec:conclusion}.$
$Throughout this paper we adopt the shorthand X=X_n\times 10^n to describe the normalization of quantity X in cgs units.$

$\section{Reconnection Driven Coherent Radio Emission}\label{sec:radiation_injection}$
$Magnetic reconnection is a process of changing the magnetic topology when two oppositely directed magnetic field lines approach each other forming a current sheet at the centre.$
$The onset of magnetic reconnection is triggered when the current sheet becomes tearing or kink unstable and breaks into a self-similar chain of plasmoids extending down to the kinetic scale \citep{Uzdensky2010PhRvL}.$
$Fast magnetic reconnection proceeds when the plasmoids collide and merge into larger islands.$
$During the coalescence of plasmoids, magnetic energy is dissipated and FMS waves are produced.$
$In highly magnetized systems with magnetization parameter \sigma\equiv B^2/4\pi \rho c^2 \gg1, FMS waves have similar dispersion relation as vacuum electromagnetic waves \citep{Thompson1998,Li2019} and can convert to coherent radio waves \citep[e.g.][]{Lyubarsky2019,Philippov2019,Lyubarsky2020ApJ}.$
$\cite{Lyubarsky2020ApJ} proposed that the coherent emission of FRBs are GHz FMS waves generated by the plasmoid collision during magnetic reconnection.$
$In their picture, the current sheets in the magnetar wind are compressed by an external outgoing LFP and become tearing unstable under the perturbation, and magnetic reconnection is  initiated.$
$Coherent FMS waves are produced in the reconnection and can escape as fast radio bursts.$
$Kinetic simulations by \citet{Mahlmann2022ApJL} have confirmed this process and found that FMS waves takes only a small fraction of the reconnection energy.$
$The characteristic frequency of the coherent FMS waves is determined by the size of the plasmoid \lambda'_c. Note we use the primed symbols to mark parameters measured in the co-moving frame of the plasma throughout the paper.$
$In the plasma comoving frame, \omega'_c \approx c/ \lambda'_c.$
$The typical plasmoid size is found to be proportional to the width of the current sheet \lambda'_c=\varsigma a' with \varsigma\sim10-100 \citep{Philippov2019,Lyubarsky2020ApJ}, and the width depends on the Larmor radius a'=\varpi r_{\rm L} with \varpi being a few.$
$\cite{Lyubarsky2020ApJ} gave the expression of the plasmoid size by balancing the pressure and energy,$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$    \lambda'_c=\sqrt{\frac{8\pi\beta_{\rm rec}\varpi}{e\sigma_T}}\frac{m_ec^2}{B'^{3/2}},$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$where \sigma_T is the Thomson scattering cross section, \beta_{\rm rec}\sim0.1 is the reconnection rate, B'=B/\Gamma is the magnetic field in the comoving frame and \Gamma is the bulk Lorentz factor.$
$Therefore, the characteristic frequency in the observer's frame is,$
$\beq$
$\nu_{\rm c}\equiv\Gamma\omega'_c/2\pi\approx 2.1 \eta_1^{-1} \Gamma^{-1/2} B_{8}^{3/2}~{\rm GHz},\label{Eq:nuc}$
$\eeq$
$where \eta\equiv\varsigma \varpi^{1/2}\beta_{\rm rec}^{1/2}.$
$This expression is confirmed numerically by \cite{Mahlmann2022ApJL} but with a slightly different expression of \eta.$

$\section{Intermediate-field FRB models and QPOs}\label{sec:FRB_QPO}$
$\subsection{Energy injection via Alfv\'en waves}$
$For a magnetar with a surface dipole magnetic field B_d and radius R_*\approx10^6 cm, the total magnetic energy is E_{B}=B_d^2R_{*}^3/6\approx1.7\times10^{47}$\Bc$^2 erg.$
$The internal magnetic field B_* can be higher and we parameterize it by B_*= \zeta B_d with \zeta>1.$
$The internal magnetic energy can be released by a sudden starquake and crustal motion which are accompanied by the crustal shear oscillations \citep[e.g.][]{Thompson1995MNRAS,Thompson2001,Duncan1998ApJL}.$
$Such oscillations are proposed to explain the QPOs observed in magnetar X-ray flares \citep[e.g.][]{Israel2005,Strohmayer2005,Strohmayer2006ApJ}.$
$As the shear wave propagates in the crust, it shakes the anchored magnetic field lines, and launches Alfv\'en waves into the magnetosphere \citep{Thompson2001,Li2016,Thompson2017,Bransgrove2020}.$
$The Alfv\'en waves carry energy into the magnetosphere and propagate along the field lines,$
$as sketched in Fig.~\ref{fig:magnetar_model}.$
$The field-line equation is r=R\sin^2{\theta}, where R is the maximum distance of the field line to the magnetar center and \theta is the angle to the magnetic axis.$
$For field lines with R\gg R_*, the field-line length is l\simeq\pi R/2.$
$The generated Alfv\'en waves of frequency $\fa$ in the magnetosphere can propagate along field lines with l\geq l_0=\pi R_0/2=c/$\fa$=1.9\times10^{10}$\fa$^{-1}~{\rm cm} as a perturbation.$
$Note that Alfv\'en waves travelling on field lines with l<l_0 may suffer strong nonlinear interaction and the dissipation mechanism is unclear. Thus we only consider magnetar quakes occurred near the magnetic polar region, so that magnetar oscillations can launch Alfv\'en waves into the magnetosphere before damping \citep[e.g.][]{Levin2007MNRAS,Hoven2012}.$
$We consider a sudden release of internal magnetic energy of E_q=h S B_*^2/8\pi in the crust with a crust thickness h\approx10^5 cm and an area S_q.$
$The magnetar quake can simultaneously launch a number of waves with different frequencies, that are of different damping time-scales \citep[e.g.][]{Levin2007MNRAS,Hoven2012,Gabler2016MNRAS}.$
$We assume that the Alfv\'en wave of frequency f_A is the dominated one, and a number (n_A) of waves at this frequency has been excited.$
$The energy carried by each wave is parameterized as \epsilon E_q\approx L_A/f_A with a power L_A and \epsilon<1/n_A.$
$The wave is launched from the magnetar surface within the same area,$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$    S_q=2.5\times10^8$\lac$$\fa$c^{-1}$\Bc$^{-2}\epsilon^{-1}\zeta^{-2} {\rm cm}^2.$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$The corresponding wave amplitude in the magnetosphere is {\delta B}=\sqrt{8\pi L_A/S_qc}.$
$Its relative amplitude to the background field near the magnetar surface is$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$    \frac{\delta B}{B_d}\approx 0.02$\fa$c^{1/2}\epsilon^{1/2}\zeta,$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$As the Alfv\'en wave propagates in the magnetosphere, its amplitude grows as {\delta B}/{B_d}\propto r^{3/2} \citep[e.g.][]{Kumar2020,Yuan2020}.$
$When the relative amplitude grows to {\delta B}/{ B}\approx1 \citep{Yuan2020,Yuan2022ApJ} at a distance of$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$   R_{\rm m}\approx 1.4\times 10^7$\fa$c^{-1/3}\epsilon^{-1/3}\zeta^{-2/3}~\rm{cm},$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$the Alfv\'en waves will become nonlinear and shear the magnetosphere.$
$The background magnetic field here can be estimated from a dipole B_{\rm m}=B_*R_*^3R_{\rm m}^{-3}.$
$Under the strong shear, the magnetosphere becomes unstable.$
$A large part of the Alfv\'en waves will be converted to FMS waves that propagates outwards radially in the form of a LFP \citep{Yuan2021} due to the interaction with the curved magnetic field line.$
$The remaining Alfv\'en waves will dissipate inside the magnetosphere by nonlinear instabilities \citep{Yuan2020} or absorbed by the magnetar \citep{Li2015}.$
$Self interactions among multiple Alfv\'en waves can enhance the wave dissipation through turbulence cascade, increasing fast wave conversion rate \citep{Li2019} or leading to fast dissipation \citep{Li2021}.$
$\vspace{-5pt}$
$\subsection{Generation of FRBs}$
$An illustration for the generation of FRBs is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:magnetar_model}.$
$During the propagation of the LFP at r>R_{\rm m}, its toroidal field follows rB_{\rm LFP } = B_{\rm LFP, m}R_{\rm m} with B_{\rm LFP, m}\approx B_{\rm m} \citep{Yuan2020,Yuan2022ApJ}.$
$As the energy contained in the LFP is higher than that of background field, the magnetosphere is distorted.$
$The poloidal field follows r^2 B_p= B_{\rm m}R_{\rm m}^{2} from the conservation of magnetic flux.$
$Thus the magnetosphere at R>R_{\rm m} can be treated as a split monopole \citep{Parfrey2013,Yuan2020,Yuan2022ApJ}.$
$When the LFP propagates beyond the light cylinder at R_L=c P/2\pi, where P is the magnetar rotation period, it enters the magnetar wind zone.$
$The toroidal field of the LFP and the poloidal field of the magnetosphere at the light cylinder are$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$    B_{\rm LFP, L}=3.4\times10^8$\Bc$$\fa$c^{2/3}\epsilon^{2/3}\zeta^{4/3}\left(\frac{P}{3 {\rm s}}\right)^{-1} \rm{G}\label{eq:bphi_LC};\B_{p,m}(R_{\rm L})=3.4\times10^5$\Bc$$\fa$c^{1/3}\epsilon^{1/3}\zeta^{2/3}\left(\frac{P}{3 {\rm s}}\right)^{-2} \rm{G}.\label{eq:bpol_LC}$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$The LFP compresses the striped wind and accelerates the plasma to a bulk Lorentz factor of \Gamma\approx0.5\sqrt{B_{\rm LFP, L}/B_{\rm w}(R_{\rm L}) }, where the wind field is described as a monopole with B_{\rm w}(r)=B_{p}(R_L)R_L/r and B_{p}(R_L) is the poloidal field of the magnetosphere at the light cylinder.$
$The pulse front propagates into the magnetar wind launched by the unperturbed magnetosphere with B_{p}(R_L)=B_*R_*^3R_{\rm L}^{-3}.$
$However, the energy carried by the LFP amplifies the magnetic field at the light cylinder to B_{p,m}(R_{\rm L}) \citep{Yuan2020,Yuan2022ApJ}, which further enhances the toroidal magnetic field in the striped wind to B_{\rm w}(R_{\rm L})\sim B_{p,m}(R_{\rm L}).$
$Therefore, the rear part of LFP will interact with the current sheets in the striped wind launched by the perturbed magnetosphere (see. Fig. \ref{fig:magnetar_model}).$
$In reality, the amplification of the wind toroidal field is highly dynamic, we therefore expect the wind field to be in the range B_{\rm w}(R_{\rm L})\in[B_*R_*^3R_{\rm L}^{-3},\; B_{p,m}(R_{\rm L})].$
$The corresponding maximum and minimum Lorentz factors of the accelerated LFPs are then$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$    &&\Gamma^{\rm max}=496 \epsilon^{1/3}\zeta^{2/3}$\fa$c^{1/3}\left(\frac{P}{3 {\rm s}}\right);\\\nonumber$
$    &&\Gamma^{\rm min}=16 \epsilon^{1/6}\zeta^{1/3}$\fa$c^{1/6}\left(\frac{P}{3 {\rm s}}\right)^{1/2}.\label{eq.Gamma}$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$In the following we parameterize \Gamma=100$\Gc$ which lies between \Gamma^{\rm min} and \Gamma^{\rm max}.$
$And we expect \Gamma\rightarrow\Gamma^{\rm min} for LFPs consisting of multiple waves (e.g. n_A\gtrsim3), such as in the SGR 1935+2154 event and FRB 20191221A (see Sec. \ref{sec:explainQPO} for more details).$
$The LFP compresses the current sheet in the striped wind, which triggers magnetic reconnection and leads to the generation of high-frequency FMS waves \citep{Lyubarsky2020ApJ,Mahlmann2022ApJL}.$
$Substituting B_{\rm LFP,L} and \Gamma into Eq.~(\ref{Eq:nuc}), we obtain the frequency of the FMS waves,$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$    $\nuc$=1.3$\fa$c$\Bc$^{3/2}\epsilon\zeta^2\left(\frac{P}{3 {\rm s}}\right)^{-3/2}\eta_1^{-1}$\Gc$^{-1/2} \rm{GHz},\label{eq:nu_final}$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$which lies in the radio band.$
$The produced FMS waves suffers from nonlinear interactions in the magnetosphere that may prevent it from escaping.$
$We can estimate the optical depth of the nonlinear interactions for the FMS waves following \citet{Lyubarsky2020ApJ},$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$    \tau_{\rm NL}\sim \frac{\kappa 2\pi\nu R_{\rm L}}{2\Gamma^2c}=0.5\kappa_{-5.5}$\ncc$\left(\frac{P}{3 {\rm s}}\right)$\Gc$^{-2},$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$where \kappa=$\Bfms$^2/B_{\rm LFP, L}^2 is the energy ratio of the high-frequency FMS waves to the LFP. In 2D simulations, it is found that a fraction \kappa\sim10^{-4} of energy from the LFP is converted to the FMS, interpreted as an upper limit of the efficiency \citep{Mahlmann2022ApJL}.$
$The ratio of radio to X-ray energy of FRB200428 is found to be 10^{-6}-10^{-5} \citep{Ridnaia2021NatAs}.$
$Here we take \kappa\sim10^{-5.5} to be the fiducial value.$
$Therefore, the FMS waves generated at the light cylinder can escape the magnetosphere without significant dissipation and be observed as FRBs.$
$There are also current sheets behind the LFP inside the magnetosphere, which has been suggested to produce an FRB \citep{Wang2020ApJ,Yuan2020,Yuan2022ApJ}.$
$However, we would argue below that the FMS waves produced behind the LFP cannot be the primary source of FRB.$
$On one hand, FMS waves emitted deep inside the magnetosphere suffers from strong dissipation due to the nonlinear interactions.$
$The optical depth inside the magnetosphere is \tau_{\rm NL}\approx({$\Bfms$}/{B_p})^2\omega R/c \citep[see Eq. A3 in][]{Lyubarsky2020ApJ} with the FMS wave magnetic field {$\Bfms$}=\sqrt{2L_{\rm FMS}/ r^2} and B_p being treated as a monopole.$
$Setting \tau_{\rm NL}\sim10, we obtain a mean-free-path$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$\ell\sim6.1\times10^7$\Bc$^{1/2}$\fa$c^{1/6}\epsilon^{1/6}\zeta^{1/3}$\ncc$^{-1/4}L_{\rm FMS,42}^{-1/4} {\rm cm},$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$which is much smaller than R_L for a typical magnetar with period 0.1-10~s.$
$On the other hand, the reconnection of the current sheet behind the LFP is supported by the reversed poloidal magnetic field \citep{Yuan2022ApJ}.$
$Near the light cylinder where the produced FMS can escape, we can estimate$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$    \frac{B_{p,m}^2(R_{\rm L})}{B_{\rm LFP, L}^2}=1.0\times10^{-6}$\fa$c^{-2/3}\epsilon^{-2/3}\zeta^{-4/3}\left(\frac{P}{3 {\rm s}}\right)^{-2}.$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$The magnetic energy here is much smaller than the energy of the LFP, therefore the escaping FMS wave must be dominated by those generated in the striped wind.$
$\vspace{-5pt}$
$\subsection{QPOs in FRBs}$
$The LFP is made up of low-frequency FMS waves converted from the propagating Alfv\'en waves.$
$This process can be viewed as the nonlinear interaction between Alfv\'en waves and the curved background magnetic field.$
$The leading order wave interaction is the three-wave interaction with the frequency of FMS wave given by f_{\rm LFP}=f_A+f_{\rm bg}.$
$As the background magnetic field can be viewed as a large scale perturbation, i.e. f_{\rm bg}\approx 0, the resulting LFP wave will have the same frequency as the Alfv\'en wave f_{\rm LFP}\approx $\fa$.$
$The LFP propagates outward radially with its thickness conserved as found by numerical simulations \citep{Yuan2022ApJ}. Therefore the LFP frequency remains constant.$
$The energy dissipation of the magnetic reconnection at the light cylinder will be mediated by this LFP wave frequency, so that we expect$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$    $\ffrb$\sim f_{\rm LFP}\approx$\fa$.$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$Note in this expression, we assume $\fa$>1/P, which will in general be satisfied for magnetars with P\gtrsim0.1 s. Otherwise the FRB profile will also be modulated by the spin period.$
$The LFP accelerates during the propagation to the light cylinder.$
$Therefore the observed width of one single pulse and peak luminosity is$
$\begin{eqnarray}$
$    W_{\rm p}\approx1/(\Gamma$\fa$),\label{eq:tpulse}\L_{\rm FMS}\approx\kappa L_A \Gamma\label{eq:lfrb}.$
$\end{eqnarray}$
$The frequency of Alfv\'en waves depends on the magnetar properties.$
$\cite{Duncan1998ApJL} studied the shear wave in the magnetar crust and found that the frequency of toroidal modes with the lowest radial node (symbolized by _lt_0) follows $\fa$(_lt_0)\approx12.2l^{1/2}(l+1)^{1/2} \rm{Hz} with l\geq2 being an integer \citep{Duncan1998ApJL}.$
$Later it is found that the crustal shear modes would couple with the MHD modes of the magnetar core, and the frequency and duration of the oscillation will be modified \citep[e.g.][]{Levin2007MNRAS,Hoven2012,Gabler2016MNRAS}.$
$Such theories indicate that the fundamental frequency of magnetar QPOs can be as low as a few Hz, and it can be much higher for high order overtones, even up to a few kHz \citep[e.g.][]{Hoven2012}.$
$The observed QPO signals in FRBs will be dominated by one or several major frequencies which carries most of the energy, and the FRB light curve is made by their superposition.$
$\vspace{-5pt}$
$\section{Application to the observed QPOs and the SGR 1935+2154 event}\label{sec:explainQPO}$
$Observations show that the FRB from the galactic magnetar, SGR 1935+2154 \citep{CHIME2020Naturmagnetar,Bochenek2020Natur}, is associated with a hard X-ray burst by several X-ray instruments\citep{Li2021NatAs,Mereghetti2020ApJL,Ridnaia2021NatAs,Tavani2021NatAs}.$
$This magnetar is of spin period and surface magnetic field P=3.2 s and B_*=2.2\times10^{14} G respectively \citep{Olausen2014,Israel2016}.$
$Two radio pulses separated by 30 ms are found in this FRB, while more pulses are detected in X-ray bands.$
$Especially, a QPO of $\fa$\approx40 Hz and n_A\gtrsim8 is detected in the X-ray light curve by the Insight-HXMT \citep{Li2022ApJ}.$
$The observed pulse width is 0.3-0.6 ms ms by CHIME and STARE2 in 0.6-1.3 GHz \citep{CHIME2020Naturmagnetar,Bochenek2020Natur}.$
$Substituting \epsilon<1/n_A\sim1/8, W_{\rm p}\sim0.5 ms, and  $\nuc$\sim1 GHz as well as the observed radio peak luminosity L_{\rm FMS}\approx10^{38} erg/s \citep{Bochenek2020Natur,Zhou2020ApJ} into Eqs. (\ref{eq:nu_final}, \ref{eq:tpulse} and \ref{eq:lfrb}), we obtain \Gamma\sim50, \zeta\gtrsim11\eta_1^{1/2} and L_A\approx 6\times10^{41} \kappa_{-5.5}^{-1} erg/s.$
$The required \Gamma is in the allowed range [22\eta_1^{1/6}, 977\eta_1^{1/3}] from Eq. (\ref{eq.Gamma}).$
$And the required L_A is higher than the observed X-ray luminosity, 1.1\times10^{41}~erg/s \citep{Ridnaia2021NatAs}.$
$Therefore, our model can explain this event self-consistently.$
$QPO signals are also observed in individual FRB events, such as the 4.6 Hz QPO in FRB 20191221A, 357.1 Hz in FRB 20210206A, 93.4 Hz in FRB 20210213A detected by CHIME \citep{CHIME2022Natur}, and the 2.4 kHz QPO in FRB 20201020A detected by Apertif \citep{Pastor-Marazuela2022arXiv}.$
$The observed QPOs with frequencies larger than 93.4 Hz mentioned above can be explained by the overtones in a wide parameter range. While the 4.6 Hz QPO in FRB 20191221A may relate to the fundamental mode. We here focus on this source, which has the highest significance \citep{CHIME2022Natur}.$
$The observed radio frequency, single pulse width, and QPO frequency of FRB 20191221A are $\nuc$\approx0.7 GHz, W_{\rm p}\approx4 ms, and f_A\approx4.6 Hz with n_A\approx9, respectively.$
$The total duration of this event is \sim3 s and we would expect P>3 s so that the QPO signal is not contaminated by the magnetar rotation.$
$Substituting them into Eqs. (\ref{eq:nu_final} and \ref{eq:tpulse}), we obtain \Gamma=54 and \zeta\gtrsim9\eta_1^{1/2}(P/3 {\rm s})^{3/4}$\Bc$^{-3/4}.$
$The required \Gamma is in the allowed range [14\eta_1^{1/6}(P/3 {\rm s})^{3/4}$\Bc$^{-1/4},367\eta_1^{1/3}(P/3 {\rm s})^{3/2}$\Bc$^{-1/2}].$
$Thus the QPO in FRB 20191221A can also be explained by our model.$
$\vspace{-5pt}$
$\section{Conclusion and Discussion}\label{sec:conclusion}$
$In this paper we revisited the intermediate-field FRB model and studied the QPOs.$
$The launch of Alfv\'en waves into the magnetosphere generates an LFP, which is made up of FMS waves at approximately the same frequencies of Alfv\'en waves ($\fa$).$
$This further generates FRBs when the LFP dissipates its energy at the current sheet near the light cylinder.$
$The FRB light curve is thus modulated by the frequency of the LFP, exhibiting QPOs at a frequency \sim$\fa$.$
$The major difference of our calculations from \cite{Lyubarsky2020ApJ} is the treatment of magnetic field configurations of the LFP and the magnetar wind, as we considered the wave dynamics in the magnetosphere.$
$The FRB frequency (Eq. \ref{eq:nu_final}), the single pulse width (Eq. \ref{eq:tpulse}), and luminosity (Eq. \ref{eq:lfrb}) depend mainly on the magnetar's period and magnetic field and the quake energetics and QPO frequency.$
$For the dynamics in the magnetosphere and the compressed striped wind, numerical simulations \citep{Yu2020,Yuan2022ApJ,Mahlmann2022ApJL} have improved the understanding of the related parameters.$
$Therefore, the major uncertainties mainly come from two quake energetic parameters (\epsilon and \zeta), which requires further studies for a better understanding.$
$With physically reasonable values for these two parameters, we find that this model can naturally and self-consistently interpret the observed frequency, pulse width, luminosity and QPO signal of the radio/X-ray event from SGR 1935+2154 and FRB 20191221A.$
$Our model can also naturally explain the observed wide energy span detected in a relative narrow frequency band, such as the broad energy range (4\times10^{36}-8\times10^{39} erg) observed in FRB 121102 at 1.25 GHz \citep{Li2021Natur}, as the frequency does not depend on the flare energy apparently.$
$And in certain parameter space for young magnetars, the frequency is in the optical band, indicating the possibility of producing fast optical transients.$
$In general, QPOs will modulate the FRB light curve. Direct identification of QPOs may require at least around ten individual pulses (n_A\gtrsim10) in one event \citep[e.g.][]{CHIME2022Natur}.$
$For the high-frequency QPOs ($\fa$\gtrsim1 kHz), the corresponding FRB pulses may overlap with each other, making it difficult to identify from the data.$
$While for the low-frequency QPOs ($\fa$\sim10 Hz), one may only expect to detect them from magnetars with P\gtrsim10/$\fa$\sim1 s so that the QPO signal is not contaminated by the magnetar spin.$
$For repeating FRBs, QPOs would affect the waiting time distribution even if only several pulses are presented in the observed individual events.$
$The peak at 3.4 ms in the waiting time distribution of FRB 121102 may be such a case \citep{Li2021Natur}.$
$As only a small portion of energy is dissipated to power FRBs, the majority of the energy will be dissipated into X-rays or carried by the ejecta.$
$The ejecta would further power an afterglow or a nebula \citep[e.g.][]{Waxman2017,Beloborodov2017,Margalit2018,WangLai2020}.$
$As magnetar flares may eject a large fraction of mass \citep[e.g.][]{Granot2006ApJ}, high-energy cosmic rays can also be produced in such afterglows/nebulae.$
$Besides, such a magnetic reconnection process could also take place in neutron star mergers \citep[e.g.][]{Wang2018,Most2022MNRAS} and accreting black holes \citep[e.g.][]{Beloborodov2017ApJ,Sridhar2021MNRAS}, thus we might also expect such reconnection driven transients from neutron star mergers, X-ray binaries, or active galactic nuclei.$

**Abstract:** Quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signals are discovered in some fast radio bursts (FRBs) such as FRB 20191221A, as well as in the X-ray burst associated with the galactic FRB from SGR 1935+2154.We revisit the intermediate-field FRB model where the radio waves are generated as fast-magnetosonic waves through magnetic reconnection near the light cylinder.The current sheet in the magnetar wind is compressed by a low frequency pulse emitted from the inner magnetosphere to trigger magnetic reconnection.By incorporating the wave dynamics of the magnetosphere, we demonstrate how the FRB frequency, the single pulse width, and luminosity are determined by the period, magnetic field, QPO frequency and quake energetics of the magnetar.We find that this model can naturally and self-consistently interpret the X-ray/radio event from SGR 1935+2154 and the QPO in FRB 20191221A.It can also explain the observed wide energy range of repeating FRBs in a narrow bandwidth.

**Figure 1. -** The schematic picture of the intermediate-field FRB model (not to scale):
    Alfv\'en waves propagate along field lines of $R\gtrsim R_0$, and become non-linear at $R_{\rm m}$, which leads to the conversion to an LFP.
    (The Alfv\'en waves and LFP are drawn with different styles and unrealistic wavelengths to make their presence clear.)
    The LFP compress the current sheet in the striped magnetar wind near the light cylinder.
    High-frequency FMS waves are generated by merging islands during the violent magnetic reconnection, which can escape as an FRB. (*fig:magnetar_model*)
