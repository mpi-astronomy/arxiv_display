**Abstract:** $\Euclid$ will collect an enormous amount of data during the mission's lifetime, observing billions of galaxies in the extragalactic sky. Along with traditional template-fitting methods, numerous Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been presented for computing their photometric redshifts and physical parameters (PP), requiring significantly less computing effort while producing equivalent performance measures. However, their performance is limited by the quality and amount of input information entering the model (the $_ features_$ ), to a level where the recovery of some well-established physical relationships between parameters might not be guaranteed (e.g., the star-forming main sequence, SFMS).   To forecast the reliability of $\Euclid$ photo- $z$ s and PPs calculations, we produced two mock catalogs simulating the photometry with the UNIONS $ugriz$ and $\Euclid$ filters. We simulated the Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) and Euclid Deep Fields (EDF), alongside two auxiliary fields. We tested the performance of a template-fitting algorithm ( $\phosphoros$ ) and four ML methods in recovering photo- $z$ s, PPs (stellar masses and star-formation rates), and the SFMS on the simulated $\Euclid$ fields. To mimic the $\Euclid$ processing as closely as possible, the models were trained with $\phosphoros$ -recovered labels and tested on the simulated ground truth. For the EWS, we found that the best results are achieved with a Mixed Labels approach, training the models with Wide survey features and labels from the $\phosphoros$ results on deeper photometry, i.e., with the best possible set of labels for a given photometry. This imposes a prior to the input features, helping the models to better discern cases in degenerate regions of feature space, i.e., when galaxies have similar magnitudes and colors but different redshifts and PPs, with performance metrics even better than those found with $\phosphoros$ . We found no more than 3 \% performance degradation using a COSMOS-like reference sample or removing $u$ band data, which will not be available until after data release DR1. The best results are obtained for the EDF, with appropriate recovery of photo- $z$ , PPs, and the SFMS.

**Figure 7. -** Results for the \gls{EWS} with the _ Mixed Labels_ approach. The true values on the $x$-axis are plotted against the predicted values on $y$. The black line is the 1:1 relation; the shaded area is the region beyond which a prediction is an outlier. Contours are the area containing $98\%$, $86\%$, $39\%$(corresponding to the $3\sigma$, $2\sigma$ and $1\sigma$ levels for a 2D histogram) and $20\%$ of the sample. Each column represents the results for the methods described in Sect. \ref{sec:Methodology}. In the first four rows, the training labels are the recovered ones, coming from $\phosphoros$ results to the mock photometry at the same depth of the field reported in the leftmost plot legend and tested on the \gls{EWS}(see Sect. \ref{sec:Mocks} for further details). The T.lab Wide-Wide case is exactly the same as the Wide-Wide case in Table \ref{tab:WideRec}. In the fifth row, we show the results of the \gls{EWS} training the models with their true labels as the best-case scenario for that particular field. The reported metrics are NMAD (purple), the outlier fraction $f_{\rm out}$(blue) and the bias (green) for the photometric redshifts and physical parameters, as well as the slope $m$, scatter $\sigma$ and fraction of passive galaxies $f_{\rm p}$ for the \gls{ms}, all defined in Sect. \ref{sec:metrics}).
