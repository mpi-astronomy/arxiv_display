**Abstract:** Intracluster light (ICL) provides a record of the dynamical interactions undergone by clusters, giving clues on cluster formation and evolution. Here, we analyse the properties of ICL in the massive cluster Abell 2390 at redshift $z= 0.228$ .Our analysis is based on the deep images obtained by the $\Euclid$ mission as part of the Early Release Observations in the near-infrared ( $\YE$ , $\JE$ , $\HE$ bands), using the NISP instrument in a 0.75 deg $^2$ field. We subtracted a point--spread function (PSF) model and removed the Galactic cirrus contribution in each band after modelling it with the \texttt{DAWIS} software. We then applied three methods to detect, characterise, and model the ICL and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG): the \texttt{CICLE} 2D multi-galaxy fitting; the \texttt{DAWIS} wavelet-based multiscale software; and a mask-based 1D profile fitting.We detect ICL out to 600 kpc. The ICL fractions derived by our three methods range between 18 \% and 36 \% (average of 24 \% ), while the BCG+ICL fractions are between 21 \% and 41 \% (average of 29 \% ), depending on the band and method. A galaxy density map based on 219 selected cluster members shows a strong cluster substructure to the south-east and a smaller feature to the north-west.Ellipticals dominate the cluster's central region, with a centroid offset from the BCG by about 70 kpc and distribution following that of the ICL, while spirals do not trace the entire ICL but rather substructures. The comparison of the BCG+ICL, mass from gravitational lensing, and X-ray maps show that the BCG+ICL is the best tracer of substructures in the cluster.Based on colours, the ICL (out to about 400 kpc) seems to be built by the accretion of small systems ( $M \sim 10^{9.5}\si{\solarmass}$ ), or from stars coming from the outskirts of Milky Way-type galaxies ( $M \sim 10^{10}\si{\solarmass}$ ). Though Abell 2390 does not seem to be undergoing a merger, it is not yet fully relaxed, since it has accreted two groups that have not fully merged with the cluster core. We estimate that the contributions to the inner 300 kpc of the ICL of the north-west and south-east subgroups are 21 \% and 9 \% respectively.

The figure shows a region of $\ang{;;700}\times\ang{;;700}$($2.5 {\rm Mpc}\times2.5 {\rm Mpc}$) centred on the BCG. (*fig:morph_contours*)

**Figure 18. -** RGB images of the BCG+ICL in the core of A 2390 ($700 $\arcsec$\times 700 $\arcsec$$). The left panel shows the \texttt{CICLE} RGB map and the right panel the \texttt{DAWIS} RGB map. The numbers in both maps mark the position of the galaxies in the groups identified by DS+ (see Sect. \ref{sec:substructures}), listed in Table \ref{table:DS+}. Both colour images were generated with Trilogy  ([Coe, Umetsu and Zitrin 2012]()) . (*fig:rgb_groups*)

**Figure 10. -** Density map of the 219 galaxies selected as belonging to the cluster A 2390 (see main text). The green contour levels correspond to 3$\sigma$, 10$\sigma$, and 20$\sigma$ above the background.  North is up and east is to the left. The image size is  $\ang{0.4;;} \times \ang{0.4;;}$(5.24 Mpc $\times$ 5.24 Mpc) and is centred on the BCG.  (*fig:densmap*)
