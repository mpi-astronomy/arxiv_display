**Abstract:** The central engines of Little Red Dots (LRDs) may be "black hole stars" (BH*s), early stages of black hole growth characterized by dense gas envelopes. So far, the most direct evidence for BH*s comes from a handful of sources where the host galaxy is completely outshone as suggested by their remarkably steep Balmer breaks. Here we present a novel scheme to disentangle BH*s from their host galaxies assuming that the [ $\ion{O}{3}$ ] 5008Å line arises exclusively from the host. Using a sample of 98 LRDs ( $z\approx2-9$ ) with high quality NIRSpec/PRISM spectra, we demonstrate that the host-subtracted median stack displays a Balmer break $>2\times$ stronger than massive quiescent galaxies, with the rest-optical continuum resembling a blackbody-like SED ( $T_{\rm{eff}}\approx4050$ K, $\log(L_{\rm{bol}})\approx43.9$ erg s $^{-1}$ , $R_{\rm{eff}}\approx1300$ au). We measure a steep Balmer decrement (H $\alpha$ /H $\beta>10$ ) and numerous density-sensitive features (e.g., $\ion{Fe}{2}$ , $\ion{He}{1}$ , $\ion{O}{1}$ ). These are hallmark signatures of dense gas envelopes, providing population-level evidence that BH*s indeed power LRDs. In the median LRD, BH*s account for $\sim20\%$ of the UV emission, $\sim50\%$ at the Balmer break, and $\sim90\%$ at wavelengths longer than H $\alpha$ with the remainder arising from the host. BH*s preferentially reside in low-mass galaxies ( $M_{\rm{\star}}\approx 10^{8} {\rm M}_{\rm{\odot}}$ ) undergoing recent starbursts, as evidenced by extreme emission line EWs (e.g., [ $\ion{O}{3}$ ] 5008Å $\approx1100$ Å, $\ion{C}{3}$ ] $\approx12$ Å), thereby favoring BH* origins linked to star-formation. We show V-shaped LRD selections are biased to high BH*/host fractions ( $\gtrsim60\%$ at 5500Å) -- less dominant BH*s may be powering JWST's blue broad-line AGN. We find BH*s are so commonplace and transient (duty cycle $\sim1\%$ , lifetime $\sim10$ Myrs) that every massive black hole may have once shone as a BH*.

**Figure 6. -** **Stacks of $\text{LRD** - \text{Host}$  difference spectra (top) and host galaxies (bottom-right) constructed by applying our decomposition procedure to each of the 98 LRDs in our sample (stacked in the bottom-left).}**Top:** The central engine of the _median_ LRD shows a steep Balmer break ($f^{\nu}(4050\rm{Å})$/$f^{\nu}(3670\rm{Å})\approx7$), extremely strong H$\alpha$ emission ($\approx850$Å), a steep Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta\approx11$), and strong $\ion${O}{1} and Fe emission. These are hallmark signatures of radiative transfer in a dense gas envelope, strongly supporting the picture that the central engine of the typical LRD is indeed a BH*. Note that the [$\ion${O}{3}] line by construction has zero luminosity, but appears over/under-subtracted because the kinematic width of the line is never exactly the same across the LRDs and the candidate hosts. **Bottom-Left:** In LRDs, these hallmark BH* features are mixed with galaxy light and are challenging to discern (e.g., there is only a weak Balmer break), underscoring the need for our procedure. **Bottom-Right:** The median host galaxy is highly star-forming, as evidenced by strong rest-optical emission lines (EW($\ion${O}{3}+H$\beta$)$\approx1700$Å) that are $\approx2-3\times$ stronger than the typical galaxy at these redshifts \citep[e.g.,][]{Endsley24}. The detection of strong $\ion${C}{3}]($\approx12$Å, $>2\times$ the typical EW at $z\approx5$) points to the hosts having undergone a recent burst \citep[e.g.,][]{Roberts-Borsani25}.

**Figure 12. -** **Wavelength-dependent BH*/LRD fractions of the BH* stack (left) and three substacks divided by $L_{5500**$ (right).} The faint substack has $38.5 < \log\left(L_{\rm{5500}} / \text{erg} \text{s}^{-1}\right) < 39.5$; the intermediate substack has $39.5 < \log\left(L_{\rm{5500}} / \text{erg} \text{s}^{-1}\right) < 40.5$; the bright substack has $40.5 < \log\left(L_{\rm{5500}} / \text{erg} \text{s}^{-1}\right) < 41.5$. Generally, the BH* provides relatively modest contributions in the rest-UV, but there is a sharp increase around $\approx3600-4000$Å (not necessarily at the Balmer limit, but redwards for the faintest). At redder wavelengths the BH* begins to dominate, accounting for almost all the light around $\approx1\mu$m. There is a strong luminosity dependence to the BH* contribution -- the brightest BH*s (green curve) are also luminous in the UV, contributing $\approx50\%$ around the region where the Fe UV forest is observed (corresponding to the prominent peaks in the UV). On the other hand, fainter BH*s (blue) make their presence known only in the rest-optical and are effectively invisible at bluer wavelengths. The sharp, almost vertical transition in BH* fraction redwards of the Balmer limit is luminosity dependent, and occurs only in the most luminous sources, whereas in fainter BH*s we witness a more gradual transition. Emission lines show expected trends -- forbidden lines such as [$\ion${O}{3}](by construction) and the [$\ion${S}{3}] doublet are prominent in hosts relative to the BH*.

**Figure 7. -** **The $\text{LRD**-\text{Host}$ difference stack has unusual properties relative to typical AGN and galaxies.}**Left:** We compare the exceptional H$\alpha$ EW and Balmer decrement of the $\text{LRD}-\text{Host}$ stack against a compilation of $z\approx0-0.6$ SDSS quasars \citep[][]{Wu22SDSS}. Our stack has few peers among these local quasars, hinting that the mechanisms powering the Balmer lines in LRDs are distinct. Indeed, the ubiquity of Balmer absorption \citep[e.g.,][]{Lin24} points to resonant scattering \citep[e.g.,][]{Chang25} and collisional excitation \citep[e.g,][]{Torralba25IFU} as opposed to e.g., photo-ionization and dust attenuation that set H$\alpha$ and H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ among classical AGN. **Right:** The Balmer break strength of our stack is among the largest observed with JWST, comparable only to The Cliff \citep[][]{degraaff25} and MoM-BH* \citep[][]{Naidu25BHstar} that are the archetypal BH*s. We highlight that the break strength of the stack lies well above the maximum expected from a standard stellar population assuming a dust-free \citet[][]{Chabrier03} IMF (gray dashed line;  ([Wang and Leja 2024](), [Rix and Naidu 2025]()) ), LRDs with Balmer breaks (red; e.g.,  ([Labbe, Greene and Matthee 2024](), [Wang and Leja 2024](), [Furtak, Labbé and Zitrin 2024](), [Kokorev, Chisholm and Endsley 2024](), [Taylor, Kokorev and Kocevski 2025]()) ), quiescent and mini-quenched galaxies (orange; e.g.,  ([Strait, Brammer and Muzzin 2023](), [Setton and Brammer 2024](), [Weibel and Setton 2024](), [Looser and Maiolino 2024]()) ), and star-forming galaxies (gray points; compiled in  ([Roberts-Borsani, Treu and Shapley 2024]()) ).
