**Abstract:** We report the discovery of a remarkable Ly $\alpha$ emitting galaxy at $z=7.278$ , JADES-GS+53.16746-27.7720 (shortened to JADES-GS-z7-LA), with EW $_0$ (Ly $\alpha$ ) $\approx400 \pm 90$ Ã… and UV magnitude $-16.7$ . The spectroscopic redshift is confirmed via rest-frame optical lines [ O ii ] , H $\beta$ and [ O iii ] in its JWST/NIRSpec Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) spectrum. The Ly $\alpha$ line is detected in both lower resolution ( $R\sim100$ ) PRISM as well as medium resolution ( $R\sim1000$ ) G140M grating spectra. The Ly $\alpha$ FWHM in the grating is $\approx360$ km s $^{-1}$ and the line peaks with [ O ii ] in $120$ km s $^{-1}$ of the systemic redshift, indicative of very little neutral gas or dust within the galaxy. We estimate the Ly $\alpha$ escape fraction to be $\sim100\%$ . JADES-GS-z7-LA has a [ O iii ] / [ O ii ] ratio (O32) of $8.8 \pm 1.1$ and ( [ O iii ] + [ O ii ] )/H $\beta$ ratio (R23) of $9.6\pm2.2$ , consistent with low metallicity and high ionization parameters. Deep NIRCam imaging also revealed a close companion source (separated by $0.23"$ ), which exhibits similar photometry to that of JADES-GS-z7-LA, with a photometric excess in the F410M NIRCam image consistent with [ O iii ] +H $\beta$ emission at the same redshift. The spectral energy distribution of JADES-GS-z7-LA indicates a `bursty' star-formation history, with a low stellar mass of $10^{7.15}$ M $_\odot$ . The only explanation of the high EW Ly $\alpha$ emission seen in JADES-GS-z7-LA is if it resides in an ionized bubble with radius $\gtrsim 3$ pMpc. Owing to the faint nature of JADES-GS-z7-LA, we show that it is incapable of single-handedly ionizing a bubble large enough. Therefore, we suggest that JADES-GS-z7-LA (and possibly the companion source) may be a part of a larger overdensity, presenting direct evidence of overlapping ionized bubbles at $z>7$ , allowing us to study the process of reionization across both small and large scales.

**Figure 1. -** Velocity shift of the $\lya$ emission line in the G140M NIRSpec spectrum with a resolution of $R\sim1000$ compared to the systemic redshift ($\Delta v=0$\kms) traced by the $\oiii$ and $\hb$ lines. The emission line appears to be symmetric, centred very close to the systemic redshift with an offset of $120\pm80$\kms, with flux bluewards of the peak. The observed line profile is indicative of significant $\lya$ photon escape thanks to virtually no neutral gas along the line-of-sight in the galaxy. (*fig:R1000_spec*)

**Figure 2. -** Distribution of $\lya$ EW and its velocity offset from the systemic redshift for JADES-GS-z7-LA (star), compared with GN-z11 \citep{bun23}(diamond), $z>7$ LAEs identified from CEERS by \citet{tan23}(circles) and other known $z>7$ LAEs from the \citet{end22c} compilation (squares), which include sources from the ALMA REBELS survey amongst others such as B14-65666 at $z=7.15$\citep{fur16, has19}, EGS-zs8-1 at $z=7.72$\citep{oes15, sta17}, COS-zs7-1 at $z=7.15$\citep{pen16, lap17, sta17} and BDF-3299 at $z=7.11$\citep{van11, mai15, car17}. We also include the $z=7.68$ galaxy Y002 \citep{val22}. JADES-GS-z7-LA lines up well with the observed strong anti-correlation between the strength of the $\lya$ emission line and its velocity offset compared to systemic redshift, and its faint UV magnitude and high $\lya$ EW compared to other $z>7$ LAEs stand out.

**Figure 3. -** Best-fitting SEDs of JADES-GS-z7-LA and its companion source, fixing the redshift to be at $z=7.278$ for both objects. We find that a good fit is obtained for the companion source at the same redshift as JADES-GS-z7-LA, which in particular can explain the photometric excess observed in the F410M band (dashed oval). Overall, JADES-GS-z7-LA has a `bluer' SED, which is reflected in the preference for a bursty star-formation history when compared to the companion source. (*fig:SED*)
