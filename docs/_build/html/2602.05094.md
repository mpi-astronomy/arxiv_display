**Abstract:** We present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151 using the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI).We took open-loop Fizeau images with 66--104 mas (5.8--9.1 pc) resolution in the N-band (at $8.7$ and $10.5$  $\micron$ ), using the full resolution of the LBTI -- equivalent to that of a 28.8 m telescope. These images were complemented by AO imaging in the LM-bands ( $3.7$ and $4.8$  $\micron$ ), with 50--62 mas (4.4--5.4 pc) resolution.These images bridge the scales between previous Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI)/MIDI and VLT/VISIR data, delivering ELT-like imaging resolution in the N-band.We resolve a dusty torus, (diameter 32 pc, PA $=125^{\circ}$ ), and detect dusty clouds within the narrow line region.Matching the resolution across four bands, we measured spatially-resolved SEDs of the central $\sim 100$ pc.Modified blackbody fitting revealed dust temperature and extinction profiles, indicating both heating from the accretion disk and additional shock heating due to the radio jet.The spatial coincidence of ionized emission (e.g., $\feii$ and $\oiii$ ), extended MIR structures, and radio features further supports the interpretation of shock heating.Comparison with NGC 1068 tests the Unified Model of Active Galactic Nuclei (Unified Model of AGN): Structures are similar, despite differences in orientation and Eddington ratio. NGC 4151’s torus is smaller than NGC 1068’s following a $r\propto L^{0.5}$ scaling.These ELT-like observations of NGC 4151 and NGC 1068 highlight the need to revise MIR radiative transfer models of AGN to account for jet-related heating.

**Figure 5. -** Comparison of MIR and visible/NIR structures.
    The $\oiii$ image is from \citet{hutchings1999} and the other visible/NIR images are from \cite{may2020}. In the _top row_ we show $[\rm{O}{III}] \lambda501$ nm, H$\alpha \lambda656$ nm, $[\rm{Fe}{II}] \lambda1644$ nm, and $H_2 \lambda1748$ nm, from left to right. In the _bottom row_ we show contours of the same, with the LBTI 10.5 \micron contours overplotted (same levels as Fig. \ref{fig:deconv}). In the $[\rm{Fe}{II}] \lambda1644$ panel, we also show the radio 5 GHz emission from \cite{williams2020}. Many of the MIR features are coincident with visible/NIR emission features. The MIR arc in particular exhibits similarities to the $[\rm{O}III]$ and H$\alpha$ emission. The molecular hydrogen emission is nearly anti-coincident with the visible/MIR features. (*fig:nir*)

**Figure 1. -** LBTI/NOMIC Fizeau images of NGC 4151 and PSF calibrator HD105140. The left two panels (in blue) show the 8.7 \micron images of the sources after frame selection, corotation, and stacking. The right two panels (in red) show the same at 10.5 \micron. The PSF calibrator has been artificially rotated to match the observed position angles of the target. Inset in each panel is the median Fizeau PSF without corotation; it shows the characteristic fringe pattern and the quality of the frame selection. Extended emission is immediately visible in the NGC 4151 images; the images are much more filled in with extended flux than the calibrators. (*fig:psfs_fizeau*)

**Figure 2. -** LBTI/LMIRCam AO images of NGC 4151 and PSF calibrator NGP 39 74. The left two panels (in viridis) show the 3.7 \micron images of the sources after frame selection, corotation, and stacking. The right two panels (in magma) show the same at 4.8 \micron. The PSF calibrator has been artificially rotated to match the observed position angles of the target. Extended emission is visible near the cores of the NGC 4151 images relative to the calibrator.
