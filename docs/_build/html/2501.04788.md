**Abstract:** We present a study of the size growth of the red sequence between $0.5<z<3,$ tracing the evolution of quiescent galaxies in both effective half-light and half-mass radii using multi-wavelength JWST/NIRCam imaging provided by the PRIMER survey.Half-light radii are measured from imaging in 6 different filters for 455 quiescent galaxies with log( $M_*/M_{\odot}$ ) $>10$ , whereas half-mass radii are derived from the F444W profiles together with the F277W-F444W color- $M_*$ /L relation.We investigate the dependence of the ratio $r_{e, \mathrm{mass}}/r_{e, \mathrm{light}}$ on redshift, stellar mass, and the wavelength used to measure $r_{e, \mathrm{light}}$ , also separating the sample into younger and older quiescent galaxies.Our data demonstrate that rest-frame infrared sizes accurately trace mass-weighted sizes while sizes measured at rest-frame optical wavelengths (0.5-0.7 $\mu$ m) are 0.1-0.2 dex larger, with only minor variations in redshift.We find that the average size of young quiescent galaxies agrees with that of old quiescent galaxies at intermediate masses, $10<$ log( $M_*/M_{\odot}$ ) $<11$ , within their respective uncertainties in all observed-frame half-light, rest-frame half-light and half-mass radius measurements.At face value, our results point to a combination of progenitor bias and minor mergers driving the size growth of intermediate-mass quiescent galaxies at $0.5<z<3$ .Our results further indicate that the varying contributions to the general quiescent population by young and old quiescent galaxies can mimic evolution in redshift.

**Figure 4. -** Methodology of deriving effective half-mass radiiMethodology of deriving half-mass radii. **Panels (A) and (B):** Measured SBP (black), convolved model from \texttt{GALFIT}(orange) and deconvolved model (dark blue) in two photometric bands (F227W and F444W, respectively). The residual between the flux from the original cutout and the convolved model is added to the deconvolved model (bright blue). This is considered the total flux. The lower panels display in red the magnitude of the residual correction to be small compared to the total flux. **Panel (C):** Radial color profile derived from the total flux in F277W (A) and F444W (B). **Panel (D):** Derived radial $M_*$ / $L_{444}$ profile using the color-$M_*$ / $L_{444}$ relation derived in Subsection \ref{subsec:derive_ML}. **Panel (E):** Radial luminosity profile derived from the total flux measured in F444W. **Panel (F):** Radial mass profile derived from multiplying the radial $M_*$ / $L_{444}$ profile (D) with the luminosity profile (E). **Panel (G):** Curve of growth for mass (bright green) and total flux in F444W  (dark green) with half-light and half-mass radii (dashed lines). The uncertainties of the half-mass radii are determined with Monte-Carlo simulations. (*fig:half_mass_method*)

**Figure 3. -** Evolution of mass of quiescent galaxies in the PRIMER survey**Left panel :** Star-forming (gray), old quiescent (red), and young quiescent (blue) galaxies in PRIMER. Since the most massive galaxies drive the rest-frame optical size difference, we select only galaxies that have masses higher than log$M_* > 10M_{\odot}$(black dashed line). **Right panel:** Selection of quiescent galaxies (only massive log$M_* > 10M_{\odot}$ sample depicted) within (V-J)-(U-V) space (black line). The dotted line divides the sample into recently quenched (blue) and older (red) quiescent galaxies. (*fig:sample_half_mass*)
