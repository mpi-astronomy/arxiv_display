**Abstract:** The recently identified Gaia population of main-sequence--white dwarf (MS+WD) binaries at separations of ${\sim} 1 {\rm AU}$ , often with moderate eccentricities, is not readily reproduced by binary population synthesis models.Barium stars represent a closely related population whose enrichment in $\sproc$ elements both confirms the presence of a WD companion and attests to past binary interaction.It also indicates that mass transfer occurred at least during the late and post-AGB phases of the WD progenitor, when $\sproc$ elements are dredged up.In this work, we further explore the connection between the astrometrically identified Gaia MS+WD binaries and the classical barium star population.To achieve this, we used high-resolution FEROS spectroscopy to measure abundances for 30 Gaia DR3 non-single-star binaries, identifying 10 as Ba-enriched. Together with our recent analysis of archival GALAH data, this yields a sample of 38 barium dwarfs with dynamically measured WD masses, compared to only 6 previously known systems with known WD masses at these separations.We find that, in cases where metallicity is sufficiently low to facilitate efficient $\sproc$ production, barium and yttrium enrichment is often detected. This enrichment is also identified in eccentric systems, suggesting that post-AGB mass transfer mechanisms are capable of pumping eccentricity into the orbit or occur without erasing it.Our results indicate that the Gaia MS+WD binaries trace the population from which barium stars emerge.  Treating the large Gaia-discovered population as an extension of known $\sproc$ enriched dwarfs opens an avenue to empirically constrain their formation and evolution.

The samples show scatter consistent with each other. Our samples uncover a significantly larger population of Ba dwarfs at $e$ > 0.1 at P < 1000 d, which is underrepresented in literature. The AMRF sample thus provides a systematic route to identifying large samples of Ba dwarfs with orbital parameters and companion WD masses from the Gaia NSS catalog. (*fig:P e general*)
