**Abstract:** Improved observational technologies have enabled the resolution of substructures and the measurement of chemical abundances in protoplanetary discs. Understanding the chemical composition of the inner disc allows us to infer the building blocks available for planet formation. Recently, the depletion of water in the inner disc has been suggested to be linked to the presence of substructures like gaps and rings further out in the disc. We investigate this hypothesis further by running 1D semi-analytical models of a protoplanetary disc with a gap to understand the combined effects of disc viscosity, gap depth, gap location and gap formation time on the composition of the inner disc (water abundance, C/O, O/H and C/H ratios). Our results show that for a specific value of disc viscosity, the simulation outcome can be classified into three regimes: shallow gap, 'traffic jam', and deep gap. While deep gaps may already be distinguishable with moderate resolution (FWHM $\sim$ 10 AU), shallow gaps remains a challenge to resolve with current capabilities. On the other hand, discs with traffic jams have a higher chance of being resolved when observed with high resolution (FWHM $\lesssim$ 5 AU) but may appear as an intensity enhancement or even featureless when observed with moderate to low angular resolution (FWHM $\gtrsim$ 10 AU). In this regard, information on the inner disc composition is useful because it can help to infer the existence of traffic jams or distinguish them from deep gaps: Discs with deep gaps are expected to have a low water content and thus high C/O ratio in the inner disc due to the effective blocking of pebbles, discs with shallow gaps would show the opposite trend (water-rich and low C/O ratio), and discs with traffic jam would have a constant -- albeit low -- inward flux of water-rich pebbles resulting in a moderate water content and sub-stellar C/O ratios. Finally, we find that the effectiveness of gaps as pebble barriers diminishes quickly when they form late $(t_{\rm gap} \gtrsim 0.1 {\rm Myr})$ , as most of the pebbles already drifted inwards.

**Figure 1. -** Time evolution of the normalised water vapour abundance, C/O, O/H and C/H abundance ratios at $r = 0.5 {\rm AU}$ as a function of gap depth for a disc with a gap at 10 AU. We plot here the results for disc viscosity $\alpha = 3\times10^{-4}$ and pebble fragmentation velocity $u_{\rm frag} = 5 {\rm ms}^{-1}$. Regimes I, II and III correspond respectively to the scenario of shallow gap, traffic jam, and deep gap. Circles and triangles are selected examples from the three regimes at different time snapshots where we further investigate their observability (see Section \ref{sec:results_observability}).

We compare the unconvolved intensity with the ones convolved with three different beams. The gray dashed lines show the evaporation fronts that mainly cause the spikes in the intensity.

The gap is located at 10 AU. (*fig:bump-10au_water*)
