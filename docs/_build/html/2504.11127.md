**Abstract:** The disk around PDS 70 hosts two directly imaged protoplanets in a gap. Previous VLT/SPHERE and recent _James Webb Space Telescope_ /NIRCam observations have hinted at the presence of a third compact source in the same gap at $\sim$ 13 au, interior to the orbit of PDS 70 b.We reduce seven published and one unpublished VLT/SPHERE datasets in _YJH_ and _K_ bands, as well as an archival VLT/NaCo dataset in _L'_ band, and an archival VLT/SINFONI dataset in _H+K_ band. We combine angular-, spectral- and reference star differential imaging to search for protoplanet candidates.We recover the compact source in all epochs, consistent with the JWST detection, moving on an arc that can be fit by Keplerian motion of a protoplanet which could be in a resonance with PDS 70 b \& c. We find that the spectral slope is overall consistent with the unresolved star and inner disk emission at 0.95--1.65 $\mum$ , which suggests a dust scattering dominated spectrum. An excess beyond 2.3 $\mum$ could be thermal emission from either a protoplanet or heated circumplanetary dust, variability, or inner disk contamination, and requires confirmation. While we currently cannot rule out a moving inner disk feature or a dust clump associated with an unseen planet, the data supports the hypothesis of a third protoplanet in this remarkable system.

**Figure 5. -** Nine years of high-contrast imaging data of PDS 70. All images are cropped to a 1$\farcs$2 $\times$ 1$\farcs$2 field of view centred on the star and in chronological order (left to right, top to bottom). The semi-transparent mask over A is 160 mas wide, roughly the inner working angle of the SPHERE coronagraph (SINFONI, NaCo and NIRCam are non-coronagraphic). The PSF-subtraction strategy is indicated in the top-left corner of the frame. The disk, b and candidate d are detected in all frames, whereas c is clearest at $\lambda>2 $\mum$$. North is up, East is to the left. Figure made using casa cube(\url{https://github.com/cpinte/casa_cube}).

**Figure 9. -** Iterative PCA-RDI for the 2022 Feb 28 epoch in Fig. \ref{fig:observations} truncated to seven principal components and obtained with three iterations, for each individual spectral channel. For all frames, the PSF of the reference star UCAC2 14412811 observed during the sequence has been subtracted. Candidate d is visible in all channels that are not contaminated by telluric absorption, whereas PDS 70 b is conspicuous at longer wavelengths (i.e., _H_-band). The grey patch represents the FWHM of the non-coronagraphic PSF and is unique for each channel. No numerical mask has been used to represent the location of the coronagraphic mask. Pixel intensities are on a linear scale with an intensity cut from the 0â€“99.5 percentiles of the entire cube. Figure made using hciplot(\url{https://github.com/carlos-gg/hciplot}).

**Figure 6. -** Overview of the PDS 70 system, including 1000 random samples from the orbital posteriors of planets b (blue curves), c (yellow), and candidate d (green). The priors and median posterior for each orbital element retrieved with Octofitter are summarized in Table \ref{tab:priors}. A shift in declination of $-0$\farcs$02$ was applied to the continuum emission (colourscale) to enforce the c\textsubscript{smm} blob to overlap with near-IR astrometry of the same epoch. The grey beam of 44 $\times$ 37 mas with $\mathrm{PA} = 51\fdg5$ in the bottom-left is for the continuum emission originally presented in \citet{Benisty:2021uj}. (*fig:three_body_problem*)
