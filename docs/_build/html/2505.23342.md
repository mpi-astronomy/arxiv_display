**Abstract:** _Euclid_ is delivering optical and near-infrared imaging data over 14 000 deg $^2$ on the sky at spatial resolution and surface brightness levels that can be used to understand the morphological transformation of galaxies within groups and clusters. Using the Early Release Observations (ERO) of the Perseus cluster, we demonstrate the capability offered by _Euclid_ in studying the nature of perturbations for galaxies in clusters. Filamentary structures are observed along the discs of two spiral galaxies, UGC 2665 and MCG +07-07-070, with no extended diffuse emission expected from tidal interactions at surface brightness levels of $\sim$ $30 {\rm mag} {\rm arcsec}^{-2}$ . The detected features exhibit a good correspondence in morphology between optical and near-infrared wavelengths, with a surface brightness of $\sim$ $25 {\rm mag} {\rm arcsec}^{-2}$ , and the knots within the features have sizes of $\sim$ 100 pc, as observed through $\IE$ imaging. Using the _Euclid_ , CFHT, UVIT, and LOFAR $144 {\rm MHz}$ radio continuum observations, we conduct a detailed analysis to understand the origin of the detected features. We constructed the _Euclid_ $\IE-\YE$ , $\YE-\HE$ , and CFHT $u - r$ , $g - i$ colour-colour plane and showed that these features contain recent star formation events, which are also indicated by their H $\alpha$ and NUV emissions. _Euclid_ colours alone are insufficient for studying stellar population ages in unresolved star-forming regions, which require multi-wavelength optical imaging data. There are features with red colours that can be explained by the presence of dust stripped along with the gas in these regions. The morphological shape, orientation, and mean age of the stellar population, combined with the presence of extended radio continuum cometary tails can be consistently explained if these features have been formed during a recent ram-pressure stripping event. This result further confirms the exceptional qualities of _Euclid_ in the study of galaxy evolution in dense environments.

**Figure 7. -** Colour scale \IE image of galaxy UGC 2665 with the scaling set to highlight faint stripped features at the galaxy outskirts. The features that are likely part of the stripped tail are marked with cyan boxes. Coloured contours overlaid on the image are for NUV N245M imaging data of the galaxy in blue, H$\alpha$ in red and $144 {\rm MHz}$ radio continuum in black. The NUV and H$\alpha$ contour levels created for $2 \sigma$, $4 \sigma$ and $6 \sigma$ are shown. The contour levels created for $3 \sigma$, $6 \sigma$ and $12 \sigma$ from LOFAR image are shown. The direction of the stripping feature is marked with magenta-coloured arrows. White contours show isophote generated for surface brightness level of $30 {\rm mag} {\rm arcsec}^{-2}$.

The direction to the cluster centre is shown with a light magenta-coloured arrow. In the bottom right of the image, the blue patch is an artifact caused by dichroic ghost in \IE imaging.
