**Abstract:** The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our understanding of the Universe by unveiling faint, near-infrared dropouts previously beyond our reach, ranging from exceptionally dusty sources to galaxies up to redshift $z \sim 14$ . In this paper, we identify F200W-dropout objects in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey which are absent from existing catalogs. Our selection method can effectively identify obscured low-mass ( $\log \text{M}_* \leq 9$ ) objects at $z \leq 6$ , massive dust-rich sources up to $z \sim 12$ , and ultra-high-redshift ( $z > 15$ ) candidates. Our goal is to uncover promising targets for further studies using deep mid-infrared imaging and/or spectroscopic follow-ups. We utilize two photometric catalogs optimized for detecting faint, red objects. Primarily relying on NIRCam photometry from the latest CEERS data release and supplementing with Mid-Infrared/(sub-)mm data when available, our analysis pipeline combines multiple SED-fitting codes, star formation histories, and the novel \texttt{CosMix} tool for astronomical stacking to maximize available photometric information. Our work highlights three $2<z<3$ dusty dwarf galaxies which have larger masses compared to the typical dusty dwarfs previously identified in CEERS. Additionally, we reveal five faint sources with significant probability of lying above $z>15$ , with best-fit masses compatible with $\Lambda$ CDM and a standard baryons-to-star conversion efficiency. Their bi-modal redshift probability distributions suggest they could also be $z<1.5$ dwarf galaxies with extreme dust extinction. We also identify a strong line emitter galaxy at $z \sim 5$ mimicking the near-infrared emission of a $z \sim 13$ galaxy. Our sample holds promising candidates for future follow-ups. Confirming ultra high-redshift galaxies or lower-z dusty dwarfs will offer valuable insights into early galaxy formation, evolution with their central black holes and the nature of dark matter, and/or cosmic dust production mechanisms in low-mass galaxies, and will help us to understand degeneracies and contamination in high-z object searches.

The F200W-dropout representation scheme is the same adopted in Figure \ref{fig:colormagplot1} and Figure \ref{fig:colormagplot2}, as well as the x-axis average errors. The black rectangle highlights the UHR LBG selection for $15 < z < 20$ galaxies by Castellano et al., (2025; _in prep._), whereas the blue shaded area corresponds to the $15 < z < 20$ LBG selection adopted in [Kokorev, Atek and Chisholm (2024)]().
