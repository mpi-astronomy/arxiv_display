**Abstract:** Turbulent gas motions drive planet formation and protoplanetary disk evolution. However, empirical constraints on turbulence are scarce, halting our understanding of its nature.Resolving signatures of the large-scale perturbations driven by disk instabilities may reveal clues on the origin of turbulence in the outer regions of planet-forming disks.We aim to predict the observational signatures of such large-scale flows, as they would appear in high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of CO rotational lines, such as those conducted by the exoALMA Large Program.Post-processing 3D numerical simulations, we explored the observational signatures produced by three candidate (magneto-)hydrodynamical instabilities to operate in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks: the vertical shear instability (VSI), the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), and the gravitational instability (GI). We found that exoALMA-quality observations should capture signatures of the large-scale motions induced by these instabilities. Mainly, flows with ring, arc, and spiral morphologies are apparent in the residuals of synthetic velocity centroid maps.A qualitative comparison between our predictions and the perturbations recovered from exoALMA data suggests the presence of two laminar disks and a scarcity of ring- and arc-like VSI signatures within the sample. Spiral features produced by the MRI or the GI are still plausible in explaining observed disk perturbations. Supporting these scenarios requires further methodically comparing the predicted perturbations and the observed disks' complex dynamic structure.

**Figure 7. -** Cartesian view of the disk perturbations at $Z\sim 2.5H$ for the HD (top), MHD (middle), and SGHD (bottom) simulations, with active VSI, MRI, and GI, respectively. From left to right, are shown perturbations in the gas density, radial velocity, meridional velocity and azimuthal velocity. The color bar limits are adjusted for each instability.

**Figure 9. -** Line centroid map residuals of the disk velocity relative to its rotation from *raw*$\rm ^{12}CO(3-2)$ predictions of disks unstable to the VSI, MRI and GI, assuming a perfect background subtraction of the disk rotation. The raw images have a $26$ m s$^{-1}$ velocity resolution. From left to right, different disk inclinations are shown. The models consider only the upper (or front) disk hemisphere, and the disk rotation is counterclockwise in the sky. The color bar limits have been adjusted for each instability.

**Figure 8. -** Selected channel maps from $\rm ^{12}CO(3-2)$ predictions of disks unstable to the VSI, MRI and GI, for an disk inclination of $30^{\circ}$. The left $2.5$ panels show the raw product, while the right $2.5$ panels include the effect of the spatial resolution ($35$ mas FWHM Gaussian beam), spectral resolution ($104$ m s$^{-1}$ channel spacing), and sensitivity of exoALMA. The models only consider the upper (or front) CO layer. (*fig:chanelmaps*)
