**Abstract:** Of the hundreds of $z\gtrsim6$ quasars discovered to date, only one is known to be gravitationally lensed, despite the high lensing optical depth expected at $z\gtrsim 6$ .High-redshift quasars are typically identified in large-scale surveys by applying strict photometric selection criteria, in particular by imposing non-detections in bands blueward of the $\text{Lyman-}\alpha$ line.Such procedures by design prohibit the discovery of lensed quasars, as the lensing foreground galaxy would contaminate the photometry of the quasar.We present a novel quasar selection methodology, applying contrastive learning (an unsupervised machine learning technique) to Dark Energy Survey imaging data.We describe the use of this technique to train a neural network which isolates an `island' of 11 sources, of which 7 are known $z\sim6$ quasars.Of the remaining four, three are newly discovered quasars (J0109--5424, $z=6.07$ ; J0122--4609, $z=5.99$ ; J0603--3923, $z=5.94$ ), as confirmed by follow-up Gemini-South/GMOS and archival NTT/EFOSC2 spectroscopy, implying a $91$ per cent efficiency for our novel selection method; the final object on the island is a brown dwarf.In one case (J0109--5424), emission below the Lyman limit unambiguously indicates the presence of a foreground source, though high-resolution optical/near-infrared imaging is still needed to confirm the quasar's lensed (multiply-imaged) nature.Detection in the _g_ band has led this quasar to escape selection by traditional colour cuts.Our findings demonstrate that machine learning techniques can thus play a key role in unveiling populations of quasars missed by traditional methods.

**Figure 4. -** 
    Confirmation spectra of the four unpublished objects of `Quasar Island' studied in this work with EFOSC2/NTT and Gemini-South/GMOS.
    The spectra are all flux-calibrated and scaled to the respective DES _z_-band magnitudes (see Table \ref{tab:quasarislandmags}).
    We show the extracted 1D error array in red.
    We confirm the discovery of three new quasars at $z\sim 6$, bringing the completeness of `Quasar Island' to $91$ per cent.
    The remaining object is a cool dwarf whose spectrum closely matches that of an M9 dwarf \citep{Burgasser2008}.
    For J0109--5424, we highlight in blue the presence of flux in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and below the Lyman limit (orange dashed line), which we interpret as evidence for a foreground lensing galaxy (see Section \ref{sec:lensed_quasar}); we also identify possible $\ion${C}{IV} and $\ion${Si}{IV} absorptions.
    For the other two quasars, no flux is detected below the Lyman limit.  (*fig:all_spectra*)

**Figure 5. -** 
DES+VHS+WISE imaging and best-fitting spectra of the candidates' photometry for galaxy, quasar and lensed quasar templates based on BAGPIPES galaxy models \citep{carnall18} and QSOGEN quasar models \citep{Temple2021,temple22} as described in Section \ref{sec:lensed_quasar}.
The images are each $7.5 \text{arcsec}$ across.
Integrated fluxes for _grizY_, _J_, _K_, _W1_ and _W2_ bands are indicated in the coloured circles.
The observed fluxes measured by the three surveys are indicated by the black squares with error bars.
The BICs for the model fits are given in the legend.
For J0109--5424, a galaxy+quasar template provides a significantly better fit than a pure galaxy or quasar template, and the source is discernable in the _g_ band imaging (top row, far left).
For J0603--3923 and J0122--4609, the best-fitting galaxy+quasar models are almost identical to the best-fitting quasar models, and there is no clear source in the _g_ band.

**Figure 1. -** Photometric selection criteria.
The black points are sources selected from three random DES tiles, most of which are likely stars.
The blue stars indicate brown dwarfs from \citet{kirkpatrick11} and \citet{best15} cross-matched to DES.
Several known high-redshift quasars are plotted, as well as a model quasar track generated using QSOGEN\citep{temple22}; both are coloured by redshift.
Our liberal photometric selection criteria are shown by the dashed lines: $\mathit{i}-\mathit{z}>1$ and $\mathit{W1}-\mathit{W2} > -0.14$(both AB).
