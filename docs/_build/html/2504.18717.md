**Abstract:** We analyze the $^{12}$ CO $J=3-2$ data cubes of the disks in the exoALMA program.  13/15 disks reveal a variety of kinematic substructures in individual channels: large-scale arcs or spiral arms, localized velocity kinks, and/or multiple faints arcs that appear like filamentary structures on the disk surface.  We find kinematic signatures that are consistent with planet wakes in six disks: AA Tau, SY Cha, J1842, J1615, LkCa 15 and HD 143006. Comparison with hydrodynamical and radiative transfer simulations suggests planets with orbital radii between 80 and 310 au and masses between 1 and 5 M $_\mathrm{Jup}$ . Additional kinematic substructures limit our ability to place tight constraints on the planet masses. When the inclination is favorable to separate the upper and lower surfaces (near 45 $^\mathrm{o}$ , $*i.e.*$ in 7/15 disks), we always detect the vertical CO snowline and find that the $^{12}$ CO freeze-out is partial in the disk midplane, with a depletion factor of $\approx 10^{-3}$ -- $10^{-2}$ compared to the warm molecular layer. In these same seven disks, we also systematically detect evidence of CO desorption in the outer regions.

**Figure 1. -** Sources displaying large-scale non-Keplerian arcs. For each object, we show the channel at systemic velocity (central column), as well as channels at two velocity offsets on the blue side of the line (first two columns) and the opposite channels on the red side of the line (last two columns).  Solid lines indicate the expected location of the isovelocity curves at Keplerian velocities $\pm$100 m s. White arrows indicate deviations from the expected isovelocity curves for Keplerian rotation, and white circles highlight velocity kinks, *i.e.* distortions of the isovelocity curves. The beam is indicated as a gray circle and the horizontal white line is a $0$\farcs$2$ scale. The color map traces the square root of the intensity between zero and the peak. Note that the ringlike structure seen in CQ Tau is the continuum emission.  (*fig:arcs*)

**Figure 5. -** $^{12}$CO $J=3-2$ observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), continuum emission, and near-infrared scattered light images for the five newly detected planet candidates. The first row shows the $^{12}$CO $J=3-2$ channels with the identified velocity kinks. The second row presents the corresponding peak intensity map. The third row displays a high-pass filtered peak intensity map using a Gaussian kernel twice the size of the beam, where we overlay the location of the planetary wake, derived using the same thermal structure as in the {\sf phantom} models and projected vertically onto the CO-emitting surface. The fourth row shows the exoALMA continuum  ([Curone, et. al 2025]()) , and the last row presents SPHERE DPI observations. The white circles indicate the velocity kinks shown in Fig. \ref{fig:kinks}, while the blue dot marks the deprojected location on the disk midplane. No SPHERE data are available for AA Tau, as it is currently too faint to lock the adaptive optics system.
