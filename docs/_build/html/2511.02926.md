**Abstract:** The evolution of the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) is a powerful probe of early star formation and galaxy stellar mass build-up. At $z>6$ , its bright end ( $M_{\rm UV} <  -21$ ) remains poorly constrained due to small survey volumes of existing near-infrared (NIR) space-based imaging surveys. The Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs) will cover 53 deg $^2$ with NIR coverage down to 26.5 AB magnitude, providing a factor of 100 increase in area compared to previous space-based surveys. They thus offer an unprecedented opportunity to select bright $z>6$ Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and definitively constrain the bright end of the UV LF. With its NIR coverage extending to $\sim2  \si{\micron}$ , $\Euclid$ has the power to detect galaxies out to $z\sim13$ . Here, we present a forecast for the number densities of $z>6$ galaxies that $\Euclid$ is expected to observe in the final EDF dataset. Using synthetic photometry from spectral energy distribution (SED) templates of $z=5$ --15 galaxies, $z=1$ --4 interlopers, and Milky Way MLT dwarfs, we investigate optimal selection methodologies for high- $z$ LBGs in the EDF datasets. We find that a combination of S/N cuts with SED fitting (over optical to MIR bands) yields the highest fidelity sample, recovering more than $76\%$ of the input synthetic $z>6$ LBGs, while limiting low- $z$ contamination to less than $10\%$ . This contamination does not include effects from instrumental artefacts, which will impact the first $\Euclid$ data releases. Auxiliary data proves critical: optical coverage from Hyper Suprime Camera and $_ Vera C. Rubin_$ Observatory will distinguish genuine Lyman breaks from contaminant features, while $\Spitzer$ /IRAC data is vital for recovering $z>10$ sources. Based on empirical double power-law LF models, we expect more than $100 000$ LBGs at $z=6$ --12 and more than $100$ sources as far back as $z>12$ in the final $\Euclid$ data release. In contrast, the steeper Schechter LF models predict no detections of $z>12$ LBGs. In this work, we also present two ultra-luminous ( $M_{\rm UV} < -23.5$ ) candidates selected from the Q1 EDF-N dataset (Euclid Quick Data Release). If their redshifts are reliable, their magnitudes suggest a DPL UV LF model at $z>9$ . This highlights the power of $\Euclid$ in constraining the bright end of the UV LF in the early Universe and in identifying the most luminous sources that are valuable for further follow-up observations.
