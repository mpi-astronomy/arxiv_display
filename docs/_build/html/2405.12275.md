. Here, we include *all* dark gaps regardless of their individual neutral hydrogen fraction. We display the shape of the mock stacked profiles from $z=5.4$ and 6.2 snapshots just for illustration purpose because their mean forest transmission and dark gap length distribution are significantly different from those at $z=5.8$, and different flux thresholds for dark gap detection are used at these redshifts.
    **(b)**$v_{\rm ext}$ distribution from the patchy reionization simulation at $z=5.8$. The observed damping wing-like profile is consistent with the model prediction that has $\langle x_{\rm HI} \rangle = 7.4\%$.
