|*Comments*| *12 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ*|
|**Abstract**| We present high spatial resolution (0.4", 2.2kpc) observations of the CO(6-5), CO(7-6) and [CI] lines and dust continuum emission from the interstellar medium in the host galaxy of the quasar J0305$-$3150 at $z=6.6$. These, together with archival [CII] data at comparable spatial resolution, enable studies of the spatial distribution and kinematics between the ISM in different phases. When comparing the radial profiles of CO, [CII] and the dust continuum, we find that the CO and dust continuum exhibit similar spatial distributions, both of which are less extended than the [CII], indicating that the CO and dust continuum are tracing the same gas component, while the [CII] is tracing a more extended one. In addition, we derive the radial profiles of the [CII]/CO, [CII]/far-infrared (FIR), CO/FIR, and dust continuum $S_{98.7 \rm GHz}/S_{258.1 \rm GHz}$ ratios. We find a decreasing $S_{98.7 \rm GHz}/S_{258.1 \rm GHz}$ ratio with radius, possibly indicating a decrease of dust optical depth with increasing radius. We also detect some of the ISM lines and continuum emission in the companion galaxies previously discovered in the field around J0305$-$3150. Through comparing the line-to-line and line-to-FIR ratios, we find no significant differences between the quasar and its companion galaxies. |

|**Abstract**| We characterize the Ly$\alpha$ halo and absorption systems toward PSO J083+11, a unique $z=6.3401$ weak-line quasar, using Gemini/GNIRS, Magellan/FIRE, and VLT/MUSE data. Strong absorptions by hydrogen and several metal lines (e.g., CII, MgII, and OI) are discovered in the spectrum, which indicates the presence of: (i) a proximate sub-damped Ly$\alpha$ (sub-DLA) system at $z=6.314$ and (ii) a MgII absorber at $z=2.2305$. To describe the observed damping wing signal, we model the Ly$\alpha$ absorption with a combination of a sub-DLA with the neutral hydrogen column density of $\log N_\mathrm{HI} = 20.03 \pm 0.30$ cm$^{-2}$ and absorption from the intergalactic medium with a neutral fraction of around 10 percent. The sub-DLA toward PSO J083+11 has an abundance ratio of [C/O] $=-0.04 \pm 0.33$ and metallicity of [O/H] $=-2.19 \pm 0.44$, similar to those of low-redshift metal-poor DLAs. These measurements suggest that the sub-DLA might truncate PSO J083+11's proximity zone size and complicate the quasar lifetime measurement. However, this quasar shows no sign of a Ly$\alpha$ halo in the MUSE datacube, where the estimated $1\sigma$ limit of surface brightness is $2.76 \times 10^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ at aperture size of 1 arcsecond, or equivalent to a Ly$\alpha$ luminosity of $\leq 43.46$ erg s$^{-1}$. This non-detection, while being only weak independent evidence on its own, is at least consistent with a young quasar scenario, as expected for a quasar with a short accretion timescale. |

|| <mark>V. Heesen</mark>, et al. -- incl., <mark>G. H. Heald</mark>, <mark>D. J. B. Smith</mark> |

|**Abstract**| Context. Cosmic rays and magnetic fields are key ingredients in galaxy evolution, regulating both stellar feedback and star formation. Their properties can be studied with low-frequency radio continuum observations, free from thermal contamination. Aims. We define a sample of 76 nearby (< 30 Mpc) galaxies, with rich ancillary data in the radio continuum and infrared from the CHANG-ES and KINGFISH surveys, which will be observed with the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) at 144 MHz. Methods. We present maps for 45 of them as part of the LoTSS data release 2 (LoTSS-DR2), where we measure integrated flux densities and study integrated and spatially resolved radio spectral indices. We investigate the radio-SFR relation, using star-formation rates (SFR) from total infrared and H $\alpha$ + 24-$\mu$m emission. Results. The radio-SFR relation at 144 MHz is clearly super-linear with $L_{144} \propto SFR^{1.4-1.5}$. The mean integrated radio spectral index between 144 and $\approx$1400 MHz is $\langle \alpha\rangle = -0.56 \pm 0.14$, in agreement with the injection spectral index for cosmic ray electrons (CRE). However, the radio spectral index maps show a variation of spectral indices with flatter spectra associated with star-forming regions and steeper spectra in galaxy outskirts and, in particular, in extra-planar regions. We found that galaxies with high star-formation rates (SFR) have steeper radio spectra; we find similar correlations with galaxy size, mass, and rotation speed. Conclusions. Galaxies that are larger and more massive are better electron calorimeters, meaning that the CRE lose a higher fraction of their energy within the galaxies. This explains the super-linear radio-SFR relation, with more massive, star-forming galaxies being radio bright. We propose a semi-calorimetric radio-SFR relation, which employs the galaxy mass as a proxy for the calorimetric efficiency. |

|| Roger Ianjamasimanana, et al. -- incl., <mark>Dane Kleiner</mark> |
|*Comments*| *20 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**| Observations of the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) in the nuclear starburst galaxy NGC 4945 with MeerKAT are presented. We find a large amount of halo gas, previously missed by HI observations, accounting for 6.8% of the total HI mass. This is most likely gas blown into the halo by star formation. Our maps go down to a $3\sigma$ column density level of $5\times10^{18} cm^{-2}$ . We model the HI distribution using tilted-ring fitting techniques and find a warp on the galaxy's approaching and receding sides. The HI in the northern side of the galaxy appears to be suppressed. This may be the result of ionisation by the starburst activity in the galaxy, as suggested by a previous study. The origin of the warp is unclear but could be due to past interactions or ram pressure stripping. Broad, asymmetric HI absorption lines extending beyond the HI emission velocity channels are present towards the nuclear region of NGC 4945. Such broad lines suggest the existence of a nuclear ring moving at a high circular velocity. This is supported by the clear rotation patterns in the HI absorption velocity field. The asymmetry of the absorption spectra can be caused by outflows or inflows of gas in the nuclear region of NGC 4945. The continuum map shows small extensions on both sides of the galaxy's major axis that might be signs of outflows resulting from the starburst activity. |

|| Omid Sameie, et al. -- incl., <mark>Andrew Wetzel</mark>, <mark>Xiangcheng Ma</mark>, <mark>Kareem El-Badry</mark> |
|*Comments*| *14 pages, 5 figures, submitted to MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**| We perform cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the formation of proto-globular cluster candidates in progenitors of present-day dwarf galaxies $(M_{\rm vir} \approx 10^{10}\, {\rm M}_\odot$ at $z=0$) as part of the "Feedback in Realistic Environment" (FIRE) project. Compact ($r_{1/2}<30$ pc), relatively massive ($0.5 \times 10^5 \lesssim M_{\star}/{\rm M}_\odot \lesssim 5\times10^5$), self-bound stellar clusters form at $11\gtrsim z \gtrsim 5$ in progenitors with $M_{\rm vir} \approx 10^9\,{\rm M}_\odot$. Cluster formation is triggered when at least $10^7\,{\rm M}_\odot$ of dense, turbulent gas reaches $\Sigma_{\rm gas} \approx 10^4\, {\rm M}_\odot\, {\rm pc}^{-2}$ as a result of the compressive effects of supernova feedback or from cloud-cloud collisions. The clusters can survive for $2-3\,{\rm Gyr}$; absent numerical effects, they would likely survive substantially longer, perhaps to $z=0$. The longest-lived clusters are those that form at significant distance -- several hundreds of pc -- from their host galaxy. We therefore predict that globular clusters forming in progenitors of present-day dwarf galaxies will be offset from any pre-existing stars within their host dark matter halos as opposed to deeply embedded within a well-defined galaxy. Properties of the nascent clusters are consistent with observations of some of the faintest and most compact high-redshift sources in \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} lensing fields and are at the edge of what will be detectable as point sources in deep imaging of non-lensed fields with the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope}. By contrast, the star clusters' host galaxies will remain undetectable. |

|| M. Villenave, et al. -- incl., <mark>C. Flores</mark> |
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in ApJ*|
|**Abstract**| High dust density in the midplane of protoplanetary disks is favorable for efficient grain growth and can allow fast formation of planetesimals and planets, before disks dissipate. Vertical settling and dust trapping in pressure maxima are two mechanisms allowing dust to concentrate in geometrically thin and high density regions. In this work, we aim to study these mechanisms in the highly inclined protoplanetary disk SSTC2D J163131.2-242627 (Oph163131, i~84deg). We present new high angular resolution continuum and 12CO ALMA observations of Oph163131. The gas emission appears significantly more extended in the vertical and radial direction compared to the dust emission, consistent with vertical settling and possibly radial drift. In addition, the new continuum observations reveal two clear rings. The outer ring, located at ~100 au, is well resolved in the observations, which allows us to put stringent constraints on the vertical extent of millimeter dust particles. We model the disk using radiative transfer and find that the scale height of millimeter sized grains is 0.5au or less at 100au from the central star. This value is about one order of magnitude smaller than the scale height of smaller micron-sized dust grains constrained by previous modeling, which implies that efficient settling of the large grains is occurring in the disk. When adopting a parametric dust settling prescription, we find that the observations are consistent with a turbulent viscosity coefficient of about alpha<=10^-5 at 100au. Finally, we find that the thin dust scale height measured in Oph163131 is favorable for planetary growth by pebble accretion: a 10 M_Earth planet may grow within less than 10 Myr, even in orbits exceeding 50au. |

|| <mark>Joseph Tomlinson</mark>, Donghui Jeong |
|*Comments*| *13 pages, 9 figures, submitted to MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**| Recently, Perturbation Theory (PT), specifically the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) and its equivalents, have proven powerful in analyzing observational data. To further this pursuit, we present a quantitative analysis for the accuracy of PT modeling by comparing its analytical prediction to the result from a suite of Quijote simulations. Specifically, we determine $k_{\rm NL}$, the wavenunmber below which the analytical prediction matches well with the N-body result, for both leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) power spectrum and bispectrum at redshifts $z=0$, $0.5$, $1$, $2$, $3$. We also quantify the binning effect in Fourier space and show that an appropriate correction must be applied to the analytic predictions in order to compare them with the discrete Fourier transform results obtained from N-body-simulation or real data. Finally, we have devised a novel spherical-Bispectrum visualization scheme fully capturing the scale and configuration dependences. The new scheme facilitates bispectrum-amplitude comparison, for example, between theory and N-body results. |

|| Yang Su, et al. -- incl., <mark>Shiyu Zhang</mark>, <mark>Shaobo Zhang</mark> |
|*Comments*| *27 pages, 7 Figures, 1 Table. To appear in ApJ. Comments are welcome!*|
|**Abstract**| Based on the MWISP survey, we study high-z CO emission toward the tangent points, in which the distances of the molecular clouds (MCs) are well determined. In the region of l=12-26 deg and |b|<5.1 deg, a total of 321 MCs with |z|> 110 pc are identified, of which nearly 30 extreme high-z MCs (EHMCs at |z|> 260 pc) are concentrated in a narrow region of R_GC=2.6-3.1 kpc. The EHMC concentrations, together with other high-z MCs at R_GC=2.3-2.6 kpc, constitute molecular crater-wall structures surrounding the edges of the HI voids that are physically associated with the Fermi bubbles. Intriguingly, some large high-z MCs, which lie in the crater-walls above and below the Galactic plane, show cometary structures with the head toward the plane, favouring the scenario that the entrained molecular gas moves with the multi-phase flows from the plane to the high-z regions. We suggest that the Milky Way nuclear wind has a significant impact on the Galactic gaseous disk. The powerful nuclear wind at ~3-6 Myr ago is likely responsible for the observational features, (1) the enhanced CO gas lying in the edges of the HI voids, (2) the deficiency of atomic and molecular gas within R_GC<3 kpc, (3) the possible connection between the EHMC concentrations and the 3-kpc arm, and (4) the elongated high-z MCs with the tail pointing away from the Galactic plane. |

|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**| Here we present a detailed study of the broadband noise in the power density spectra of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 during the hard state of its 2018 outburst, using the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) observations. The broadband noise shows two main humps, which might separately correspond to variability from a variable disk and two Comptonization regions. We fitted the two humps with multiple Lorentzian functions and studied the energy-dependent properties of each component up to 100--150 keV and their evolution with spectral changes. The lowest frequency component is considered as the sub-harmonic of QPO component and shows different energy dependence compared with other broadband noise components. We found that although the fractional rms of all the broadband noise components mainly decrease with energy, their rms spectra are different in shape. Above $\sim$ 20--30 keV, the characteristic frequencies of these components increase sharply with energy, meaning that the high-energy component is more variable on short timescales. Our results suggest that the hot inner flow in MAXI J1820+070 is likely to be inhomogeneous. We propose a geometry with a truncated accretion disk, two Comptonization regions. |

|| Atila Poro, et al. -- incl., <mark>Farnad Hedayati</mark> |
|*Comments*| *6 figures, 4 tables, accepted by the Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics (RAA) journal*|
|**Abstract**| The first multi-color light curve analysis of the AH Mic binary system is presented. This system has very few past observations from the southern hemisphere. We extracted the minima times from the light curves based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach and obtained a new ephemeris. To provide modern photometric light curve solutions, we used the Physics of Eclipsing Binaries (Phoebe) software package and the MCMC approach. Light curve solutions yielded a system temperature ratio of 0.950, and we assumed a cold star-spot for the hotter star based on the O'Connell effect. This analysis reveals that AH Mic is a W-subtype W UMa contact system with a fill-out factor of 21.3% and a mass ratio of 2.32. The absolute physical parameters of the components are estimated by using the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) parallax method to be M_h(M_Sun)=0.702(26), M_c(M_Sun)=1.629(104), R_h(R_Sun)=0.852(21), R_c(R_Sun)=1.240(28), L_h(L_Sun)=0.618(3) and L_c(L_Sun)=1.067(7). The orbital angular momentum of the AH Mic binary system was found to be 51.866(35). The components' positions of this system are plotted in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram. |

|| Theodore Kareta, Vishnu Reddy, Juan A. Sanchez, <mark>Walter M. Harris</mark> |
|*Comments*| *18 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in the Planetary Science Journal on April 1, 2022*|
|**Abstract**| The Near-Earth Comet P/2016 BA$_{14}$ (PanSTARRS) is a slow-rotatating nearly-dormant object, a likely dynamical twin of 252P/LINEAR, and was recently shown to have a mid-infrared spectrum very dissimilar to other comets. BA$_{14}$ also recently selected one of the back-up targets for the ESA's \textit{Comet Interceptor}, so a clearer understanding of BA$_{14}$'s modern properties would not just improve our understanding of how comets go dormant, but could also aid planning for a potential spacecraft visit. We present observations of BA$_{14}$ taken on two dates during its 2016 Earth close approach with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, both of which are consistent with direct observations of its nucleus. The reflectance spectrum of BA$_{14}$ is similar to 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, albeit highly phase-reddened. Thermal emission contaminates the reflectance spectrum at longer wavelengths, which we correct with a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo thermal modeling code. The models suggest $BA_{14}$'s visible geometric albedo is $p_V=0.01-0.03$, consistent with radar observations, its beaming parameter is typical for NEOs observed in its geometry, and its reflectrance spectrum is red and linear throughout H and K band. It appears very much like a "normal" comet nucleus, despite its mid-infrared oddities. A slow loss of fine grains as the object's activity diminished might help to reconcile some of the lines of evidence, and we discuss other possibilities. A spacecraft flyby past BA$_{14}$ could get closer to the nucleus than with a more active target, and we highlight some science questions that could be addressed with a visit to a (nearly-)dormant comet. |

|| Anna Lueber, et al. -- incl., <mark>Kevin Heng</mark> |
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in ApJ. The complete figure sets will be available in the online journal*|
|**Abstract**| A large suite of 228 atmospheric retrievals is performed on a curated sample of 19 brown dwarfs spanning the L0 to T8 spectral types using the open-source Helios-r2 retrieval code, which implements the method of short characteristics for radiative transfer and a finite-element description of the temperature-pressure profile. Surprisingly, we find that cloud-free and cloudy (both gray and non-gray) models are equally consistent with the archival SpeX data from the perspective of Bayesian model comparison. Only upper limits for cloud properties are inferred if log-uniform priors are assumed, but the cloud optical depth becomes constrained if a uniform prior is used. Water is detected in all 19 objects and methane is detected in all of the T dwarfs, but no obvious trend exists across effective temperature. As carbon monoxide is only detected in a handful of objects, the inferred carbon-to-oxygen ratios are unreliable. The retrieved radius generally decreases with effective temperature, but the values inferred for some T dwarfs are implausibly low and may indicate missing physics or chemistry in the models. For the early L dwarfs, the retrieved surface gravity depends on whether the gray or non-gray cloud model is preferred. Future data are necessary for constraining cloud properties and the vertical variation of chemical abundances, the latter of which is needed for distinguishing between the chemical instability versus traditional cloud interpretation of the L-T transition. |

|*Comments*| *10 pages, 8 figures, 3 Appendix sections (10 pages, 13 figures). Accepted in MNRAS on April 4 2022*|
|**Abstract**| Understanding the distribution of angular momentum during the formation of planetary systems is a key topic in astrophysics. Data from the $\textit{Kepler}$ and $\textit{Gaia}$ missions allow to investigate whether stellar rotation is correlated with the presence of planets around Sun-like stars. Here, we perform a statistical analysis of the rotation period of 493 planet-hosting stars. These are matched to a control sample, without detected planets, with similar effective temperatures, masses, radii, metallicities, and ages. We find that planet-hosting stars rotate on average $1.63 \pm 0.40$ days slower. The difference in rotation is statistically significant both in samples including and not including planets confirmed by radial velocity follow-up observations. We also analyse the dependence of rotation distribution on various stellar and planetary properties. Our results could potentially be explained by planet detection biases depending on the rotation period of their host stars in both RV and transit methods. Alternatively, they could point to a physical link between the existence of planets and stellar rotation, emphasising the need to understand the role of angular momentum in the formation and evolution planetary systems. |

|| Aakash Bhat, Andreas Irrgang, <mark>Ulrich Heber</mark> |
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**| Runaway stars are ejected from their place of birth in the Galactic disk, with some young B-type runaways found several tens of kiloparsecs from the plane traveling at speeds beyond the escape velocity. Young open clusters are a likely place of origin, and ejection may be either through N-body interactions or in binary supernova explosions. The excellent quality of Gaia astrometry opens up the path to study the kinematics of young runaway stars to such a high precision that the place of origin in open stellar clusters can be identified uniquely. We developed an efficient minimization method to calculate whether two or more objects may come from the same place, which we tested against samples of Orion runaways. Our fitting procedure was then used to calculate trajectories for known runaway stars where we used Gaia data and updated radial velocities. We found that only half of the sample could be classified as runaways while the others were walkaway stars. Most of the latter stars turned out to be binaries. We identified parent clusters for runaways based on their trajectories and then used cluster age and flight time of the stars to investigate whether the ejection was likely due to a binary supernova or due to a dynamical ejection. In particular, we show that the classical runaways AE Aurigae and $\mu$ Columbae might not have originated together, with $\mu$ Columbae having an earlier ejection from Collinder 69, a cluster near the ONC. The second sample investigated comprises a set of distant runaway B stars in the halo which have been studied carefully by quantitative spectral analyses. We are able to identify candidate parent clusters for at least four stars including the hyper-runaway candidate HIP 60350. The ejection events had to be very violent, ejecting stars at velocities as large as 150 to 400 km/s. |

|**Abstract**| We present the results of our long term radio monitoring campaign at 1.3GHz (MeerKAT) and 15.5GHz (Arcminute Microkelvin Imager - Large Array, AMI-LA) for the outburst of the recently discovered neutron star X-ray binary Swift J1858.6-0814. Throughout the outburst, we observe radio emission consistent with a quasi-persistent, self-absorbed jet. In addition, we see two flares at MJD 58427 and 58530. The second flare allows us to place constraints on the magnetic field and minimum energy of the jet at 0.2G and 5x10^37erg, respectively. We use the multi-frequency radio data in conjunction with data from Swift-BAT to place Swift J1858.6-0814 on the radio/X-ray correlation. We find that the quasi-simultaneous radio and BAT data makes Swift J1858.6-0814 appears to bridge the gap in the radio/X-ray plane between atoll and Z sources. Furthermore, AMI-LA observations made whilst Swift J1858.6-0814 was in the soft state have allowed us to show that the radio emission during the soft state is quenched by at least a factor of four. |

|**Abstract**| We report on timing and spectral analysis of transient Be X-ray pulsar GRO J1750-27 by using the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observation from September 2021. This is the fourth outburst of the system since 1995. The NuSTAR observation was performed during the rising phase of the outburst. Pulsations at a period of 4.4512743(1) s were observed in the 3-60 keV energy range. The average pulse profile comprised of a broad peak with a weak secondary peak which evolved with energy. We did not find any appreciable variation in the X-ray emission during this observation. The broad-band phase-averaged spectrum is described by a blackbody, a powerlaw or Comptonization component. We report discovery of Fe K$_{\alpha}$ line at 6.4 keV along with presence of two cyclotron resonant scattering features around 36 and 42 keV. These lines indicate a magnetic field strength of $3.72_{-0.25}^{+0.10} \times 10^{12}$ and $4.37 \pm 0.10 \times 10^{12}$ G for the neutron star. We have estimated a source distance of $\sim$ 14 kpc based on the accretion-disc torque model. |

|*Comments*| *22 pages, 14 figures, 3 tables, the abstract is abridged*|
|**Abstract**| In this work, we probe the star formation history of the Universe using tomographic cross-correlation between the cosmic infrared background (CIB) and galaxy samples. The galaxy samples are from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), while the CIB maps are made from \planck\, sky maps. We measure the cross-correlation in harmonic space with a significance of 43$\sigma$. We model the cross-correlation with a halo model, which links CIB anisotropies to star formation rates (SFR) and galaxy abundance. We assume that SFR has a lognormal dependence on halo mass, while galaxy abundance follows the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model. The cross-correlations give a best-fit maximum star formation efficiency of $\eta_{\mathrm{max}}= 0.41^{+0.09}_{-0.14}$ at a halo mass $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{peak}}/M_{\odot})= {12.14\pm 0.36}$. The derived star formation rate density (SFRD) is well constrained up to $z\sim 1.5$. The constraining power at high redshift is mainly limited by the KiDS survey depth. A combination with external SFRD measurements from previous studies gives $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{peak}}/M_{\odot})=12.42^{+0.35}_{-0.19}$. This tightens the SFRD constraint up to $z=4$, yielding a peak SFRD of $0.09_{-0.004}^{+0.003}\,M_{\odot} \mathrm { year }^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ at $z=1.74^{+0.06}_{-0.02}$, corresponding to a lookback time of $10.05^{+0.12}_{-0.03}$ Gyr. Both constraints are consistent, and the derived SFRD agrees with previous studies and simulations. Additionally, we estimate the galaxy bias $b$ of KiDS galaxies from the constrained HOD parameters and yield an increasing bias from $b=1.1_{-0.31}^{+0.17}$ at $z=0$ to $b=1.96_{-0.64}^{+0.18}$ at $z=1.5$. Finally, we provide a forecast for future galaxy surveys and conclude that, due to their considerable depth, future surveys will yield a much tighter constraint on the evolution of the SFRD. |

|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**| We present Monte Carlo Physarum Machine: a computational model suitable for reconstructing continuous transport networks from sparse 2D and 3D data. MCPM is a probabilistic generalization of Jones's 2010 agent-based model for simulating the growth of Physarum polycephalum slime mold. We compare MCPM to Jones's work on theoretical grounds, and describe a task-specific variant designed for reconstructing the large-scale distribution of gas and dark matter in the Universe known as the Cosmic web. To analyze the new model, we first explore MCPM's self-patterning behavior, showing a wide range of continuous network-like morphologies -- called "polyphorms" -- that the model produces from geometrically intuitive parameters. Applying MCPM to both simulated and observational cosmological datasets, we then evaluate its ability to produce consistent 3D density maps of the Cosmic web. Finally, we examine other possible tasks where MCPM could be useful, along with several examples of fitting to domain-specific data as proofs of concept. |

|| Yoshifumi Futaana, et al. -- incl., <mark>Herman Andersson</mark> |
|*Comments*| *Submitted to ApJ (2022-03-19)*|
|**Abstract**| A Micro-Channel Plate (MCP) is a widely used component for counting particles in space. Using the background counts of MCPs on Mars Express and Venus Express orbiters operated over 17 years and 8 years, respectively, we investigate the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) characteristics in the inner solar system. The MCP background counts at Mars and Venus on a solar cycle time scale exhibit clear anti-correlation to the sunspot number. We conclude that the measured MCP background contain the GCR information. The GCR characteristics measured using the MCP background at Mars show features that are consistent with the ground-based measurement in solar cycle 24. The time lag between the sunspot number and the MCP background at Mars is found ~9 months. The shorter-term background data recorded along the orbits (with a time scale of several hours) also show evident depletion of the background counts due to the absorption of the GCR particles by the planets. Thanks to the visible planetary size change along an orbit, the GCR contribution to the MCP background can be separated from the internal contribution due to the \b{eta}-decay. Our statistical analysis of the GCR absorption signatures at Mars implies that the effective absorption size of Mars for the GCR particles have a >100 km larger radius than the solid Martian body. |
