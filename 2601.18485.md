**Abstract:** Large-scale filaments ubiquitously exist in the Galactic interstellar medium, and their radial profiles offer insights into their formation mechanisms. We present a statistical analysis of molecular hydrogen column density ( $\rm N(H_2)$ ) and dust temperature ( $\rm T_d$ ) radial profiles for 35 Galactic large-scale filaments. We divided their spines into 315 segments, extracted the radial profiles of each segment using $\rm N(H_2)$ and $\rm T_d$ maps derived from $Herschel$ Hi-GAL data, and estimated the asymmetry degree within the radial profiles ( $\alpha_{\rm asy}$ ), as well as the length proportion of segments with asymmetric profiles across the entire filament ( $f_{\rm asy}$ ).We found that Galactic large-scale filaments reside in surroundings distinctly asymmetric and varied in $\rm N(H_2)$ , and mild asymmetric yet stable in $\rm T_d$ .Different filament morphology types do not show significant differences in $\alpha_{\rm asy}$ or $f_{\rm asy}$ . A bent filament shape does not necessarily correspond to an asymmetric radial profile, whereas a straight filament shape may be associated with a symmetric profile.Segments with asymmetric surroundings in $\rm N(H_2)$ may not simultaneously appear asymmetric in $\rm T_d$ , and vice versa.We found three filaments with 4-44 \% of their spine show asymmetric $\rm N(H_2)$ and $\rm T_d$ radial profiles in inverse trends, likely caused by nearby H ii region. H ii regions of similar scale to large filaments can induce asymmetric radial profiles within them, indicating their influence on filament evolution. However, they are unlikely to independently trigger the formation of an entire Galactic large-scale filament, in contrast to their role in small-scale filament formation.

**Figure 6. -** (a) Distribution of the weighted average asymmetric degree $|1-\alpha_{\rm asy}|$ in the $\rm N(H_2)$ and $\rm T_d$ radial profiles of the 35 filaments, weighted by the segment length. The upper panel corresponds to the $\rm N(H_2)$ case, the lower to the $\rm T_d$ case. The x-axis shows the filaments ordered by increasing $|1-\alpha_{\rm asy, N}|$. The shape of the data points indicates the parental catalog of the filament, and color represents the morphology of the filament: L (red), C (orange), S (cyan), H (purple), and X (blue), as defined in Section \ref{subsec:filsample}. Additional gray dashed horizontal line at 0 represents the symmetric scenarios. (b) Violin plots of $|1-\alpha_{\rm asy}|$ for the five LSF morphology classes. The upper panel shows the $\rm N(H_2)$ case, the lower panel shows the $\rm T_d$ case. The violins have their corresponding morphology types labeled in the x-axis, and their colors are in the same definition as (a). The white point in each violin represents the median, and the thick black line spans the 25th and 75th percentiles. Additional gray dashed horizontal line at 0 marks symmetric scenarios.

**Figure 10. -** The three LSFs with IAA segments identified as influenced by nearby Hii regions. Backgrounds from the left to right column refer to the MeerKAT spectral index map [Goedhart, et. al (2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.531..649G), Hi-GAL $\rm N(H_2)$ and $\rm T_d$ map  ([Marsh, et. al 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.471.2730M/abstract)) . The red crosses and black segments connecting them represent the filament spine, segments colored in magenta have IAA radial profiles. Dashed boxes mark the radial profile sampling regions of each segment. Circles represent nearby WISE Hii regions, orange ones matches the filament distance within its uncertainty range, while cyan circles either differ in distance or lack distance information. A 5 pc scale bar is included in the lower right corner of each panel. (*fig8_IAAfil*)

**Figure 7. -** (a) Estimated $f_{\rm asy}$ based on the $\rm N(H_2)$ and $\rm T_d$ radial profiles of all 35 LSFs. The upper panel corresponds to the $\rm N(H_2)$ case, and the lower panel to the $\rm T_d$ case. The x-axis arranges the filaments by increasing $f_{\rm asy, N}$. Data point shapes and colors follow the same definitions as in Figure \ref{fig4_alpha}. Dashed gray dashed horizontal lines at 0 and 1 represent fully symmetric and fully asymmetric surroundings, respectively. (b) Violin plots of $f_{\rm asy}$ for the five LSF morphology classes, with the $\rm N(H_2)$ case in the upper panel, and the $\rm T_d$ case in the lower panel. Morphology labels and color conventions are the same as in Figure \ref{fig4_alpha}. Dashed gray horizontal lines at 0 and 1 represent fully symmetric and asymmetric surroundings, respectively.
