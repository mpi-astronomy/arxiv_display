**Abstract:** We present an updated catalog of TeV gamma-ray sources based on the fifth pass of data from the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory. This release benefits from improved event reconstruction and nearly three additional years of observations. It also incorporates a systematic multi-source fitting framework, enabling more flexible and accurate modeling of the gamma-ray sky. This fitting procedure was modeled after the manual approach used in HAWC analyses of individual sources and regions as well as other gamma-ray catalogs, like the 4FGL. In addition to more varied modeling of source morphology and spectral parameters compared to previous HAWC catalogs, this catalog uses a robust modeling of Galactic diffuse TeV emission. The fitting procedure uses both point-like and symmetric Gaussian spatial templates to model the source morphology. The spectral shape of the emission is modeled with either a simple power-law or log-parabola to explore curvature in the spectral energy distribution. We report 85 sources at the 4 $\sigma$ level, including 11 sources not associated with any TeVCat source using a distance-based association criterion. Distance-based association with the 1LHAASO catalog results in 22 4HWC sources without a counterpart. Additionally, there are 12 sources not associated with any physical counterpart in the Low- or High-Mass X-Ray Binary, the ATNF, or _Fermi_ Pulsar, or SNR catalogs of sources. Five of the aforementioned sources have no counterpart in any of the catalogs searched and represent an opportunity for follow-up observations.
