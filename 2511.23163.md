**Abstract:** $\bfseries$ $\boldmath$ Large-amplitude variations are commonly observed in the atmospheres of directly imaged exoplanets and brown dwarfs. VHS 1256B, the most variable known planet-mass object, exhibits a near-infrared flux change of nearly 40 \% , with red color and silicate features revealed in recent JWST spectra, challenging current theories. Using a general circulation model, we demonstrate that VHS 1256B’s atmosphere is dominated by planetary-scale dust storms persisting for tens of days, with large patchy clouds propagating with equatorial waves. This weather pattern, distinct from the banded structures seen on solar system giants, simultaneously explains the observed spectra and critical features in the rotational light curves, including the large amplitude, irregular evolution, and wavelength dependence, as well as the variability trends observed in near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams of ${\add dusty}$ substellar atmospheres.

**Figure 3. -** **Model spectroscopic light curves, spectrum, and comparisons to the JWST data.**{$\footnote$size _Panels A, B, and C:_ synthetic light curves from the GCM in three epochs of outputs corresponding to three characteristic evolution stages of the equatorial dust storm. Blue lines are light curves running through the HST/WFC3 G141 filter and the red lines are those running through the Spitzer 4.5 $\mu$m filter. _Panel D:_  model spectrum of VHS 1256B based on the GCM outputs at the time when the light curve reaches the minimum at epoch 1, with a spectral resolution of $R\sim 3000$ (black line), and the observed spectrum of VHS 1256B obtained by JWST (colored lines) \cite{miles2023}. In the radiative transfer post-processing, we have slightly altered the gas compositions of $H_2$O, CO and $CH_4$ taking into account the possible chemical disequilibrium caused by dynamical mixing \cite{miles2023}. The JWST spectrum is scaled for a direct comparison with the model spectrum, and different colors are those measured by different instruments, and the grey lines represent error bars. Important molecular gas and silicate cloud absorbers are highlighted. _Panels E, F, G, and H:_ zoom-in of the spectra in a few interesting wavelength regions: panel E contains $H_2$O and alkali metal absorption; panel F shows primarily the $CH_4$ absorption; panel G highlights the CO absorption; and panel H exhibits the silicate cloud absorption.} (*fig.summary*)

**Figure 1. -** **Bolometric thermal flux maps, their time evolution near the equator, and the resulting long-term light-curve evolution from the GCM.**{$\add$ _Panel A, B, C:_ Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) bolometric flux maps from the GCM at different epochs, showing global-scale dust storms (the dark regions) at the equator. }_Panel D:_ the Hovmoller diagram (longitude-time sequence) of the TOA bolometric flux near the equator. The flux is averaged over latitudes within $\pm 10$ degrees to cover a fraction of the meridionally extended waves. The dark features evolving towards the upper right mean the eastward propagation of the dust storms.  _Panel E:_ the long-term white light curve of the GCM (black line). The red line is the light curve with periodic signals less than 4 rotation periods filtered out. The much smaller amplitude of the filtered light curve suggests that the variability (black line) is mostly rotational rather than from an intrinsic variation of the mean atmospheric state. Epochs 1, 2, and 3 enclosed in the panel correspond to {$\add$ a few different characteristic states of the equatorial waves}. {$\add$ _Panel F:_ a zoom-in of the light curve between elapsed time of 4400 to 6500 hours.} (*fig.whitelight*)
