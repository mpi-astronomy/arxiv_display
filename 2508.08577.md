**Abstract:** We present the number density of massive ( $ \mathrm{ log (M_{*}/M_{\odot}) > 10.3} $ ) quiescent galaxies at $2<z<5$ using JWST NIRSpec PRISM spectra. This work relies on spectra from RUBIES, which provides excellent data quality and an unparalleled, well-defined targeting strategy to robustly infer physical properties and number densities. We identify quiescent galaxy candidates within RUBIES through principal component analysis and construct a final sample using star formation histories derived from spectro-photometric fitting of the NIRSpec PRISM spectra and NIRCam photometry. By inverting the RUBIES selection function, we correct for survey incompleteness and calculate the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at these redshifts, providing the most complete spectroscopic estimates prior to cosmic noon to date. We find that early massive quiescent galaxies are surprisingly common ( $\gtrsim 10^{-5}$ Mpc $^{-3}$ by $4<z<5$ ), which is consistent with previous studies based on JWST photometry alone and/or in smaller survey areas. We compare our number densities with predictions from six state-of-the-art cosmological galaxy formation simulations. At $z>3$ , most simulations fail to produce enough massive quiescent galaxies, suggesting the treatment of feedback and/or the channels for early efficient formation are incomplete in most galaxy evolution models.

**Figure 1. -** Demonstration of the PCA analysis of NIRSpec/PRISM spectra from the DJA: The top row includes super color (SC) distributions (left and center) and derived eigenspectra (right panel). Each SC corresponds to the normalization of an eigenspectrum for each individual source, thus SC space location maps to spectral types. The bottom rows highlight representative examples: Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies (brown triangle), Little Red Dots (yellow circle), Old Quiescent Galaxies (red hexagon), Young Quiescent/Post-Starburst Galaxies (green star), Evolved/Napping Star-Forming Galaxies (blue cross), and Young Star-Forming Galaxies (purple cross). The de-redshifted original spectrum is shown in grey. The \texttt{SpectRes}-resampled spectrum used in PCA is shown as black dots.   (*fig:pca_selection*)

**Figure 6. -** Left panel: Different flavors of total quiescent galaxy number density binned by redshifts from this sample. We show the number density derived from the entire extended quiescent sample (pink hexagons), the entire strict quiescent sample (red hexagons), and the strict quiescent sample but using parent catalog sources from the entire field rather than just the survey footprints for completeness calculation (orange hexagons). Neither our quiescence criteria nor any potential survey targeting bias has a significant impact on the resulting number density. Middle panel: Our fiducial quiescent galaxy number density compared to literature values using JWST data. Our result is in agreement with previous JWST measurements overall. Right panel: Number densities of old ($t_{90} > 0.8 Gyr$) and young ($t_{90} < 0.8 Gyr$) quiescent galaxies in this work compared to (non-JWST) literature values. This work finds a higher number density for young quiescent galaxies at $3<z<4$ and for old quiescent galaxies at $2<z<3$ than previous non-JWST works.  (*fig:number-densities-observations*)

**Figure 2. -** Example spectro-photometric fits of a $z\sim4$ post-starburst galaxy (ID: RUBIES-UDS-12594) and an old quiescent galaxy (ID: RUBIES-EGS-42328). For each row, the upper left panel shows the SED of observed NIRCam photometry and uncertainty (orange circle and error bar), observed NIRSpec PRISM spectrum and uncertainty (red solid line and pink bands), best-fit model photometry and its 68\% confidence interval (black square and errorbar), and best-fit model spectrum and its 68\% confidence interval (black solid line and grey band). The bottom left panel shows the residuals of our fits to the observed photometry (orange squares) and spectrum (red solid line). The inset shows the NIRCam/F444W image of the target galaxy. The red rectangle traces the central MSA micro-shutter used to compute slit-like aperture photometry, and the red circle traces the circular photometric catalog aperture. The right panels show the median (lines) and $16-84\%$ intervals (bands) for the inferred SFHs and $t_90$ measurements. These fits allow us to robustly determine the physical properties of these galaxies. (*fig:SED_young_QG*)
