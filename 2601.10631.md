**Abstract:** Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations suggest that the disc of $\hd$ is being actively shaped by embedded, yet unseen protoplanets, as indicated by numerous gas and dust substructures consistent with planet-disc interaction models. We report the first detection of simple organic molecules, HCN and $\CtwoH$ , tracing a candidate circumplanetary disc (CPD) in the $\hd$ system, located at an orbital radius of $R=88\pm7$ au and azimuth $\phi=46\pm3^\circ$ (or $R=0\farcs{75}$ , $\rm{{PA}}=350^\circ$ in projected sky coordinates), and originating near the midplane of the circumstellar disc. The signature is localised but spectrally resolved, and it overlaps with a previously reported planet candidate, P94, identified through kinematic perturbations traced by CO lines. We propose a scenario in which the observed chemical anomalies arise from increased heating driven by the forming planet and ongoing accretion through its CPD, facilitating the thermal desorption of species that would otherwise remain frozen out in the disc midplane, and potentially triggering the activation barriers of chemical reactions that lead to enhanced molecular production. Based on a first-order dynamical analysis of the HCN spectrum from the CPD---isolated with a 7 $\sigma$ significance---we infer an upper limit on the planet mass of 1.8 $\Mj$ , consistent with predictions from CO kinematics and constraints from direct imaging studies. By comparing the CPD sizes derived from our models with theoretical expectations where the CPD radius corresponds to roughly one-third of the planet’s Hill radius, we favor CPD gas temperatures $T > 150$ K, planet masses $M_{\rm p} < 1.0$ $\Mj$ , and CPD radii $R_{\rm CPD} < 2$ au.

**Figure 6. -** Illustration of the folding procedure used to isolate the $\hcnfull$  spectra from the localised signal around the kinematic planet P94, possibly tracing circumplanetary disc (CPD) emission. The blueshifted side of the circumstellar disc (CSD) is spectrally mirrored and subtracted from the redshifted side, where the planet resides, retaining the excess intensity contribution from the candidate CPD. The bottom panel shows the resulting folded spectra extracted from a $7\times7$ pixel box ($\sim\!2$ beams per side) centred on the proposed CPD location at $R = 0$\farcs${75}$ and $\mathrm{PA} = 350^\circ$. Gaussian fits to the brightest 20\% of the spectra are overlaid as orange lines. The global peak profile has an amplitude of 5.9 mJy beam$^{-1}$ and a centroid velocity of 2.29 $\kms$  marked by the vertical dashed line, measured with respect to the inferred systemic velocity of the CSD.

**Figure 8. -** Deprojected view of the disc of $\hd$  as traced by HCN $J=3\rightarrow2$ emission in the 2.3 $\kms$  velocity channel relative to the circumstellar disc’s $\upsilon_{\rm LSRK}$, assuming elevated (left panel) and midplane (right panel) emission heights. Overlaid are Keplerian isovelocity curves at values around the inferred CPD centroid velocity ($\sim\!2.3$\kms ; see Sect. \ref{subsec:cpd} for details). The observed CPD emission is consistent with a midplane origin, as indicated by its alignment with the isovelocity curve (yellow line) at the CPD centroid velocity when a $z/r = 0$ is adopted for the channel‑map deprojection. The right panel also includes $C_2$H emission (in purple contours) at the same velocity channel, with the CPD signal overlapping that seen in HCN.

**Figure 9. -** Selected intensity maps for $\hcnfull$  and $\CtwoH$full$F=3\rightarrow2$ lines, shown at mirrored (blue) and around (red) velocity channels where a localised signal overlaps with the kinematic planet candidate P94 first proposed by  ([Izquierdo, et. al 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...928....2I), [Izquierdo, et. al 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A&A...674A.113I)) , providing unprecedented evidence of circumplanetary material orbiting a still-forming planet (see Sect. \ref{subsec:cpd}). A guiding dashed box is centred at the inferred location of the signal, at a projected separation of $R = 0$\farcs${75}$ from the image centre and a position angle of $\mathrm{PA} = 350^\circ$, measured from north through east. Although the hf1, hf2, and hf3 cubes for the HCN intensity channels correspond to datasets imaged at the central frequencies of different hyperfine components in the $J=3\rightarrow2$ group, the bulk of the emission in all cases originates from the dominant $F=4\rightarrow3$ line, blended with the $F=2\rightarrow1$ and $F=3\rightarrow2$ components. Contours enclose emission above five times the rms noise level of 0.43 mJy beam$^{-1}$ for HCN and 0.53 mJy beam$^{-1}$ for $C_2$H.
