|**Abstract**|            Rocky planets orbiting M-dwarf stars are prime targets for characterizing terrestrial atmospheres, yet their long-term evolution under intense stellar winds and high-energy radiation remains poorly understood. The Kepler-1649 system, which hosts two terrestrial exoplanets orbiting an M5V star, presents a valuable opportunity to explore atmospheric evolution in the extreme environments characteristic of M-dwarf stellar systems. In this Letter we show that both planets could have retained atmospheres over gigayear timescales. Using a multi-species magnetohydrodynamic model, we simulate atmospheric ion escape driven by stellar winds and extreme ultraviolet radiation from 0.7 to 4.8 Gyrs. The results show that total ion escape rates follow a power-law decline ($\propto \tau^{-1.6}$ for Kepler-1649 b, $\propto \tau^{-1.5}$ for Kepler-1649 c$\,$), with O$^{+}$ dominating atmospheric loss (76.8%-98.7%). The escape rates at 4.8 Gyrs are two orders of magnitude lower than those during the early epochs ($1.9\times10^{27}$ s$^{-1}$ at 0.7 Gyr vs. $3.0\times10^{25}$ s$^{-1}$ at 4.8 Gyrs for planet b$\,$), while planet b consistently exhibits 1.1-1.9$\times$ higher O$^{+}$ escape rates than planet c due to its closer orbit (0.051 AU vs. 0.088 AU). Despite substantial early atmospheric erosion, both planets may still retain significant atmospheres, suggesting the potential for long-term habitability. These findings offer predictive insight into atmospheric retention in M-dwarf systems and inform future JWST observations aimed at refining habitability assessments.         |

|**Abstract**|            The study of molecular line emission is crucial to unveil the kinematics and the physical conditions of gas in star-forming regions. Our aim is to quantify the reliability of using individual molecular transitions to derive physical properties of the bulk of the H2 gas, looking at morphological correlations in their overall integrated molecular line emission with the cold dust. For this study we selected transitions of H2CO, CH$_3$OH, DCN, HC$_3$N, CH$_3$CN, CH$_3$OCHO, SO, and SiO and compared them with the 1.38 mm dust continuum emission at different spatial scales in the ALMAGAL sample, that observed a total of 1013 targets covering all evolutionary stages of the high-mass star-formation process and different conditions of clump fragmentation. We used the method of the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) implemented in the tool astroHOG to compare the morphology of integrated line emission with maps of the 1.38 mm dust continuum emission. Moreover, we calculated the Spearman's correlation coefficient, and compared it with our astroHOG results. Only H$_2$CO, CH$_3$OH, and SO show emission on spatial scales comparable with the diffuse continuum emission. However, from the HOG method, the median correlation of the emission of each of these species with the continuum is only $\sim$24-29%. In comparison with the dense fragments these molecular species still have low values of correlation. On the other hand DCN, HC$_3$N, CH$_3$CN, and CH$_3$OCHO show a good correlation with the dense dust fragments, above 60%. The worst correlation is seen with SiO, both with the extended continuum emission and with compact sources. From the comparison of the results of the HOG method and the Spearman's correlation coefficient, the HOG method gives much more reliable results than the intensity-based coefficient in estimating the level of similarity of the emission morphology.         |

|| <mark>L. Xie</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-04-18*|
|*Comments*| *11 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in A&A*|
|**Abstract**|            Ram pressure stripping (RPS) has a non-negligible impact on the gas content of cluster galaxies. We use the semi-analytic model GAEA and the hydro-simulation TNG to investigate whether cluster galaxies suffer a strong RPS that is sufficient to remove a significant fraction of their gas during the first pericentric passage. We estimate that a ram pressure of $10^{-10.5}$, $10^{-12} $, $10^{-13.5} $ $g cm^{-1} s^{-2}$ can remove at most $90\%$, $50\%$, and $20\%$ of the cold gas reservoir from low-mass galaxies with $9<\log M_{\star}/{\rm M}_{\odot} <9.5$, assuming the gas can be stripped instantaneously. We then use this information to divide the phase space diagram into `strong', `moderate', `weak', and `no' RPS zones. By tracing the orbit of galaxies since $2.5R_{vir}$, we find in both GAEA and TNG that about half of the galaxies in Virgo-like halos ($\log M_h / M_{\odot} \sim 14 $) did not suffer strong RPS during the first pericentric passage. In Coma-like halos ($\log M_h / M_{\odot} \sim 15$), almost all galaxies have suffered strong RPS during the first pericentric passage, which can remove all gas from low-mass galaxies but is insufficient to significantly reduce the gas content of more massive galaxies. In general, results from TNG and GAEA are consistent, with the RPS being only slightly stronger in TNG than in GAEA. Our findings suggest that most cluster galaxies will maintain a notable fraction of their gas and continue forming stars after the first pericentric passage, except for those with low stellar mass ($\log M_{\star}/{\rm M}_{\odot} <9.5$) in very massive halos ($\log M_{h}/{\rm M}_{\odot} > 15$).         |

|**Abstract**|            Euclid will image ~14000 deg^2 of the extragalactic sky at visible and NIR wavelengths, providing a dataset of unprecedented size and richness that will facilitate a multitude of studies into the evolution of galaxies. In the vast majority of cases the main source of information will come from broad-band images and data products thereof. Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify or develop scalable yet reliable methodologies to estimate the redshift and physical properties of galaxies using broad-band photometry from Euclid, optionally including ground-based optical photometry also. To address this need, we present a novel method to estimate the redshift, stellar mass, star-formation rate, specific star-formation rate, E(B-V), and age of galaxies, using mock Euclid and ground-based photometry. The main novelty of our property-estimation pipeline is its use of the CatBoost implementation of gradient-boosted regression-trees, together with chained regression and an intelligent, automatic optimization of the training data. The pipeline also includes a computationally-efficient method to estimate prediction uncertainties, and, in the absence of ground-truth labels, provides accurate predictions for metrics of model performance up to z~2. We apply our pipeline to several datasets consisting of mock Euclid broad-band photometry and mock ground-based ugriz photometry, to evaluate the performance of our methodology for estimating the redshift and physical properties of galaxies detected in the Euclid Wide Survey. The quality of our photometric redshift and physical property estimates are highly competitive overall, validating our modeling approach. We find that the inclusion of ground-based optical photometry significantly improves the quality of the property estimation, highlighting the importance of combining Euclid data with ancillary ground-based optical data.
