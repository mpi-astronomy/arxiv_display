|**Abstract**|            In the third APOKASC catalog, we present data for the complete sample of 15,808 evolved stars with APOGEE spectroscopic parameters and Kepler asteroseismology. We used ten independent asteroseismic analysis techniques and anchor our system on fundamental radii derived from Gaia $L$ and spectroscopic $T_{\rm eff}$. We provide evolutionary state, asteroseismic surface gravity, mass, radius, age, and the spectroscopic and asteroseismic measurements used to derive them for 12,418 stars. This includes 10,036 exceptionally precise measurements, with median fractional uncertainties in \nmax, \dnu, mass, radius and age of 0.6\%, 0.6\%, 3.8\%, 1.8\%, and 11.1\% respectively. We provide more limited data for 1,624 additional stars which either have lower quality data or are outside of our primary calibration domain. Using lower red giant branch (RGB) stars, we find a median age for the chemical thick disk of $9.14 \pm 0.05 ({\rm ran}) \pm 0.9 ({\rm sys})$ Gyr with an age dispersion of 1.1 Gyr, consistent with our error model. We calibrate our red clump (RC) mass loss to derive an age consistent with the lower RGB and provide asymptotic GB and RGB ages for luminous stars. We also find a sharp upper age boundary in the chemical thin disk. We find that scaling relations are precise and accurate on the lower RGB and RC, but they become more model dependent for more luminous giants and break down at the tip of the RGB. We recommend the usage of multiple methods, calibration to a fundamental scale, and the usage of stellar models to interpret frequency spacings.         |

|| C. Xie, et al. -- incl., <mark>A. Kospal</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-10-02*|
|*Comments*| *16 pages, 7 figures, submitted to ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            We present JWST/MIRI observations of T~Cha, a highly variable ($\Delta V \sim$3-5\,mag) accreting Sun-like star surrounded by a disk with a large ($\sim 15$\,au) dust gap. We find that the JWST mid-infrared spectrum is signiticantly different from the {\it Spitzer} spectrum obtained 17 years before, where the emission at short wavelengths ($5-10 \mu m$) has decreased by $\sim 2/3$ while at longer wavelengths ($15-25 \mu m$) it increased by up to a factor of $\sim 3$. This 'seesaw' behavior is contemporary with a fairly constant higher optical emission captured by the All Sky Automated Survey. By analyzing and modelling both SEDs, we propose that JWST caught the star during an outburst that destructed the asymmetric inner disk wall responsible for the high optical variability and lower $15-25$\,micron\ emission during the {\it Spitzer} time. The dust mass lost during this outburst is estimated to be comparable ($\sim 1/5$) to the upper limit of the total micron-sized dust mass in the inner disk of T~Cha now. Monitoring this system during possible future outbursts and more observations of its quiescent state will reveal if the inner disk can be replenished or will continue to be depleted and vanish.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Charting Cluster Construction with VUDS and ORELSE (C3VO) survey is an ongoing imaging and spectroscopic campaign aiming to map out the growth of structure up to $z\sim5$ and was born from the combination of the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS) and the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large-Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey. As we previously accomplished with the ORELSE survey, we apply our technique known as Voronoi tessellation Monte-Carlo (VMC) mapping to search for serendipitous galaxy overdensities at $2<z<5$ in the three C3VO fields. We also apply the same technique to mock observations of simulated galaxies with properties derived from the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) semi-analytic model (SAM) in order to judge the effectiveness of our as a function of redshift, total mass, and fraction of spectroscopic redshifts. We find typical completeness and purity values of the order 30-50%, with a strong dependence on mass and redshift, with values as high as $\sim$80% and $\sim$70%, respectively, in the best-case scenario for $\log (M_{z=0}/M_{\odot}) > 14$. In the C3VO fields, we were able to recover many of the previously known structures in the literature as well as find hundreds of new overdensity candidates, once again demonstrating the powerful capabilities of VMC mapping when applied to wide-field optical and infrared galaxy evolution surveys at ever higher redshifts.         |

|| <mark>J. Li</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-10-02*|
|*Comments*| *22 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in Icarus*|
|**Abstract**|            In some recent work, we provided a quantitative explanation for the number asymmetry of Jupiter Trojans by hypothesizing a free-floating planet (FFP) flyby into the Solar System. In support of that explanation, this paper examines the influence of the same FFP flyby on the Hilda asteroids, which orbit stably in the 3:2 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. The observed Hilda population exhibits two distinct resonant patterns: (1) a lack of Hildas with resonant amplitudes < 40 deg. at eccentricities < 0.1; (2) a nearly complete absence of Hildas with amplitudes < 20 deg., regardless of eccentricity. Previous models of Jupiter migration and resonance capture could account for the eccentricity distribution of Hildas but have failed to replicate the unusual absence of those with the smallest resonant amplitudes, which theoretically should be the most stable. Here we report that the FFP flyby can trigger an extremely rapid outward migration of Jupiter, causing a sudden shift in the 3:2 Jovian resonance. Consequently, Hildas with varying eccentricities would have their resonant amplitudes changed by different degrees, leading to the observed resonant patterns. We additionally show that, in our FFP flyby scenario, these patterns are consistently present across different resonant amplitude distributions of primordial Hildas arising from various formation models. We also place constraints on the potential parameters of the FFP, suggesting it should have an eccentricity of 1-1.3 or larger, an inclination up to 30 deg. or higher, and a minimum mass of about 50 Earth masses.         |

|**Abstract**|            We use Minkowski functionals to analyse weak lensing convergence maps from the first-year data release of the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC-Y1) survey. Minkowski functionals provide a description of the morphological properties of a field, capturing the non-Gaussian features of the Universe matter-density distribution. Using simulated catalogs that reproduce survey conditions and encode cosmological information, we emulate Minkowski functionals predictions across a range of cosmological parameters to derive the best-fit from the data. By applying multiple scales cuts, we rigorously mitigate systematic effects, including baryonic feedback and intrinsic alignments. From the analysis, combining constraints of the angular power spectrum and Minkowski functionals, we obtain $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = {0.808}_{-0.046}^{+0.033}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = {0.293}_{-0.043}^{+0.157}$. These results represent a $40\%$ improvement on the $S_8$ constraints compared to using power spectrum only, and are consistent with previous non-Gaussian statistics analyses of the same dataset. Our study demonstrates the power of Minkowski functionals beyond two-point statistics for constraining and breaking the degeneracy between $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a chemical analysis of selected HII regions from the PHANGS-MUSE nebular catalogue. Our intent is to empirically re-calibrate strong-line diagnostics of gas-phase metallicity, applicable across a wide range of metallicities within nearby star-forming galaxies. To ensure reliable measurements of auroral line fluxes, we carried out a new spectral fitting procedure whereby only restricted wavelength regions around the emission lines of interest are taken into account: this assures a better fit for the stellar continuum. No prior cuts to nebulae luminosity were applied to limit biases in auroral line detections. Ionic abundances of O+, O++, N+, S+, and S++ were estimated by applying the direct method. We integrated the selected PHANGS-MUSE sample with other existing auroral line catalogues, appropriately re-analysed to obtain a homogeneous dataset. This was used to derive strong-line diagnostic calibrations that span from 12+log(O/H) = 7.5 to 8.8. We investigate their dependence on the ionisation parameter and conclude that it is likely the primary cause of the significant scatter observed in these diagnostics. We apply our newly calibrated strong-line diagnostics to the total sample of HII regions from the PHANGS-MUSE nebular catalogue, and we exploit these indirect metallicity estimates to study the radial metallicity gradient within each of the 19 galaxies of the sample. We compare our results with the literature and find good agreement, validating our procedure and findings. With this paper, we release the full catalogue of auroral and nebular line fluxes for the selected HII regions from the PHANGS-MUSE nebular catalogue. This is the first catalogue of direct chemical abundance measurements carried out with PHANGS-MUSE data.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2024-10-02*|
|*Comments*| *To be published in: Handbook of Exoplanets, 2nd Edition, Hans Deeg and Juan Antonio Belmonte (Eds. in Chief), Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature. 59 pages, 8 figures. This is an update of arXiv:1804.01532*|
|**Abstract**|            The planetary population synthesis method aims at comprehensively testing planet formation theories against observational evidence and providing theoretical sets of planets to help interpret observations and inform instrument development. Recent developments on the theoretical and observational sides are reviewed: First, observational constraints are summarized, then, the work flow of population synthesis and its two main components are presented, which are, global end-to-end models of planetary formation and evolution and probability distributions for the disk initial conditions. Next, the output of four recent population synthesis models is compared in detail and differences and similarities are discussed. The goal is to help the reader understand the assumptions that were made and how they impact the results. Furthermore, future directions of research are identified and the impact of current and future observational programs is discussed. With JWST, evidence on disk and planet compositions emerges. Planet formation models need to prepare for these near-future developments by including self-consistent magnetic wind-driven gas and dust disk evolution, planetary migration, as well as employ hybrid pebble and planetesimal accretion, which are identified as dominant modes of accretion in different mass regimes.         |
