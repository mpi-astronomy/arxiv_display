|**Abstract**| [abridged]Photoevaporation and dust-trapping are individually considered to be important mechanisms in the evolution and morphology of protoplanetary disks. We studied how the presence of early substructures affects the evolution of the dust distribution and flux in the millimeter continuum of disks that are undergoing photoevaporative dispersal. We also tested if the predicted properties resemble those observed in the population of transition disks. We used the numerical code Dustpy to simulate disk evolution considering gas accretion, dust growth, dust-trapping at substructures, and mass loss due to X-ray and EUV (XEUV) photoevaporation and dust entrainment. Then, we compared how the dust mass and millimeter flux evolve for different disk models. We find that, during photoevaporative dispersal, disks with primordial substructures retain more dust and are brighter in the millimeter continuum than disks without early substructures, regardless of the photoevaporative cavity size. Once the photoevaporative cavity opens, the estimated fluxes for the disk models that are initially structured are comparable to those found in the bright transition disk population ($F_\textrm{mm} > 30\, \textrm{mJy}$), while the disk models that are initially smooth have fluxes comparable to the transition disks from the faint population ($F_\textrm{mm} < 30\, \textrm{mJy}$), suggesting a link between each model and population. Our models indicate that the efficiency of the dust trapping determines the millimeter flux of the disk, while the gas loss due to photoevaporation controls the formation and expansion of a cavity, decoupling the mechanisms responsible for each feature. In consequence, even a planet with a mass comparable to Saturn could trap enough dust to reproduce the millimeter emission of a bright transition disk, while its cavity size is independently driven by photoevaporative dispersal. |

|**Abstract**| Molecular outflows are believed to be a key ingredient in the process of star formation. The molecular outflow associated with DR21 Main in Cygnus-X is one of the most extreme, in mass and size, molecular outflows in the Milky Way. The outflow is suggested to belong to a rare class of explosive outflows which are formed by the disintegration of protostellar systems.We aim to explore the morphology, kinematics,and energetics of the DR21 Main outflow, and compare those properties to confirmed explosive outflows to unravel the underlying driving mechanism behind DR21. Line and continuum emission are studied at a wavelength of 3.6\,mm with IRAM 30 m and NOEMA telescopes as part of the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE) program. The spectra include ($J= 1-0$) transitions of HCO$^+$, HCN, HNC, N$_2$H$^+$, H$_2$CO, CCH tracing different temperature and density regimes of the outflowing gas at high-velocity resolution ($\sim$ 0.8 km s$^{-1}$). The map encompasses the entire DR21 Main outflow and covers all spatial scales down to a resolution of ~3" ($\sim$ 0.02 pc). Integrated intensity maps of the HCO$^+$ emission reveal a strongly collimated bipolar outflow with significant overlap of the blue- and red-shifted emission. The opening angles of both outflow lobes decrease with velocity, from $\sim80$ to 20$^{\circ}$ for the velocity range from 5 to 45 km s$^{-1}$ relative to the source velocity. No evidence is found for the presence of elongated, "filament-like" structures expected in explosive outflows. N$_2$H$^+$ emission near the western outflow lobe reveals the presence of a dense molecular structure which appears to be interacting with the DR21 Main outflow. The overall morphology as well as the detailed kinematics of the DR21 Main outflow is more consistent with that of a typical bipolar outflow instead of an explosive counterpart. |

|**Abstract**| The occurrence of X-class solar flares and their potential impact on the space weather often receive great attention than other flares. But predicting when and where an X-class flare will occur is still a challenge. With the multi-wavelength observation from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and FengYun- 3E satellite, we investigate the triggering of a GOES X1.0 flare occurring in the NOAA active region (AR) 12887. Our results show that this unique X-class flare is bred in a relatively small but complex quadrupolar AR. Before the X-class flare, two filaments (F1 and F2) exist below a null-point topology of the quadrupolar AR. Magnetic field extrapolation and observation reveal that F1 and F2 correspond to two magnetic flux ropes with the same chirality and their adjacent feet rooted at nonconjugated opposite polarities, respectively. Interestingly, these two polarities collide rapidly, accompanied by photospheric magnetic flux emergence, cancellation and shear motion in the AR center. Above this site, F1 and F2 subsequently intersect and merge to a longer filament (F3) via a tether-cutting-like reconnection process. As a result, the F3 rises and erupts, involving the large-scale arcades overlying filament and the quadrupolar magnetic field above the AR, and eventually leads to the eruption of the X-class flare with a quasi-X-shaped flare ribbon and a coronal mass ejection. It suggests that the rapid collision of nonconjugated opposite polarities provides a key condition for the triggering of this X-class flare, and also provides a featured case for flare trigger mechanism and space weather forecasting. |
