|**Abstract**|            We present observations of ASASSN-22ci (AT2022dbl), a nearby tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) at a distance of d$_L \simeq 125$ Mpc. Roughly two years after the initial ASAS-SN discovery, a second flare was detected coincident with ASASSN-22ci. UV/optical photometry and optical spectroscopy indicate that both flares are likely powered by TDEs. The striking similarity in flare properties suggests that these flares result from subsequent disruptions of the same star. Each flare rises on a timescale of $\sim$30 days, has a temperature of $\approx$30,000 K, a peak bolometric luminosity of $L_{UV/Opt} = 10^{43.6 - 43.9} \textrm{ erg} \textrm{ s}^{-1}$, and exhibits a blue optical spectrum with broad H, He, and N lines. No X-ray emission is detected during either flare, but X-ray emission with an unabsorbed luminosity of $L_{X} = 3\times10^{41} \textrm{ erg} \textrm{ s}^{-1}$ and $kT = 0.042$ eV is observed between the flares. Pre-discovery survey observations rule out the existence of earlier flares within the past $\approx$6000 days, indicating that the discovery of ASASSN-22ci likely coincides with the first flare. If the observed flare separation of $720 \pm 4.7$ days is the orbital period, the next flare of ASASSN-22ci should occur near MJD 61075 (2026 February 04). Finally, we find that the existing sample of repeating TDE candidates is consistent with Hills capture of a star initially in a binary with a total mass between $\sim$$1 - 4$ M$_{\odot}$ and a separation of $\sim$$0.01 - 0.1$ AU.         |

|| <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |

|*Comments*| *10 pages, 7 figures, Accepted to be published in ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            In this manuscript, optical quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with 550 day periodicity related to a candidate of sub-pc binary black hole (BBH) system are reported in the reverberation mapped broad line quasar PG 1411+442 but with different line profile of broad H$\alpha$ from that of broad H$\beta$ in its rms spectrum. First, considering sine function to describe the 18.8years-long light curves from the CSS, ASAS-SN and ZTF, 550days periodicity can be confirmed with confidence level higher than 5$\sigma$. Second, the stable 550days optical QPOs can be re-confirmed with confidence levels higher than 5$\sigma$ by the Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the sine-like phase-folded light curves and the WWZ technique determined power maps. Third, based on simulated light curves by CAR process, confidence level higher than $3.5\sigma$ can be confirmed for the optical QPOs not related to intrinsic AGN variability. Moreover, considering spatial separation of central two BH accreting systems smaller than expected sizes of broad emission line regions (BLRs), central total BH mass higher than $10^6{\rm M_\odot}$ could lead to few effects of supposed BBH systems on estimated virial BH masses. Meanwhile, disk precession is not preferred due to the similar estimated sizes of optical and NUV emission regions, and jet precession can be ruled out due to PG 1411+442 as a radio quiet quasar. The results strongly indicate it would be practicable by applying very different line profiles of broad Balmer emission lines to detect candidates of BBH systems in normal broad line AGN in the near future.         |

|| <mark>H. Jiang</mark>, T. Namikawa |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-12-23*|
|*Comments*| *10 pages, 6 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            We explore the impact of the reionization history on examining the shape of the power spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. The large-scale CMB generated from the reionization epoch is important in probing the PGWs from all-sky experiments, such as LiteBIRD. The reionization model has been constrained by several astrophysical observations. However, its uncertainty could impact constraining models of the PGWs if we use large-scale CMB polarization. Here, by expanding the analysis of Mortonson & Hu (2007), we estimate how reionization uncertainty impacts constraints on a generic primordial tensor power spectrum. We assume that CMB polarization is measured by a LiteBIRD-like experiment and the tanh model is adopted for a theoretical template when we fit data. We show that constraints are almost unchanged even if the true reionization history is described by an exponential model, where all parameters are within 68% Confidence Level (CL). We also show an example of the reionization history that the constraints on the PGWs are biased more than 68% CL. Even in that case, using E-mode power spectrum on large scales would exclude such a scenario and make the PGW constraints robust against the reionization uncertainties.         |
