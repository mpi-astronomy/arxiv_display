|**Abstract**|            Stellar-mass black holes descend from high-mass stars, most of which had stellar binary companions. However, the number of those binary systems that survive the binary evolution and black hole formation is uncertain by multiple orders of magnitude. The survival rate is particularly uncertain for massive stars with low-mass companions, which are thought to be the progenitors of most black hole X-ray binaries. We present a search for close black hole companions (separations less than 20 solar radii) to AFGK-type stars in TESS, i.e. the non-accreting counterparts to and progenitors of low-mass X-ray binaries. Such black holes can be detected by the tidally induced ellipsoidal deformation of the visible star, and the ensuing photometric light-curve variations. From an initial sample of 4.7 million TESS stars, we have selected 457 candidates for such variations. However, spectroscopic followup of 251 of them shows that none are consistent with a close black hole companion. On the basis of this non-detection, we determine (2 $\sigma$ confidence) that fewer than one in $10^5$ Solar-type stars in the Solar neighbourhood host a short-period black hole companion. This upper limit is in tension with a number of ``optimistic'' population models in the literature that predict short-period black hole companions around one in $10^{4-5}$ stars. Our limits are still consistent with other models that predict only a few in $10^{7-8}$.         |

|**Abstract**|            [Abridged] Our view of dust in primordial galaxies is limited towards a few tens of z~7 galaxies, pre-selected from UV-optical observations, and are thus not necessarily representative of the bulk of the sources at these redshifts. In this work, we aim at constraining the dust properties of galaxies at 6<z<12 by making the most of the A3COSMOS database in the JADES/GOODS-South field. We stacked ALMA band 6 and 7 observations of 4464 galaxies covered by the A3COSMOS database and used the measurements as constraints to perform UV-to-FIR SED modelling. We obtain tentative signals for the brightest UV galaxies (MUV<-19mag) as well as for the most massive ones (log Mstar>9) at 6<z<7, and upper limits for fainter (MUV>-19mag), lower mass sources (log Mstar<9), and at higher redshift (z>7). Fitting these 6<z<7 galaxies with ALMA constraints results in lower star formation rates (-0.4dex) and FUV attenuation (-0.5mag) for galaxies with log Mstar>8, compared to the fit without FIR. We extend the LIR vs MUV relation down to MUV=-19mag and show a tentative breakdown of the relation at fainter UV magnitudes. The positions of the JADES z~6.5 sample on the IRX versus beta and IRX versus Mstar diagrams are consistent with those of the ALPINE (z~5.5) and REBELS (z~6.5) samples, suggesting that the dust composition and content of our mass-selected sample are similar to these UV-selected galaxies. Extending our analysis of the infrared properties to z>7 galaxies, we find a non-evolution of beta with redshift in the MUV range probed by our sample (-17.24+/-0.62) and highlight the fact that samples from the literature are not representative of the bulk of galaxy populations at z>6. We confirm a linear relation between AV and 1/sSFR with a flatter slope than previously reported due to the use of ALMA constraints. Our results suggest that rapid and significant dust production has already happened by z~7.         |

|| X. Yan, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            Solar filaments are spectacular objects in the solar atmosphere, consisting of accumulations of cool, dense, and partially ionized plasma suspended in the hot solar corona against gravity. The magnetic structures that support the filament material remain elusive, partly due to the lack of high resolution magnetic field measurements in the chromosphere and corona. In this study, we reconstruct the magnetic structures of a solar intermediate filament using EUV observations and two different methods, to follow the injection of hot material from a B-class solar flare. Our analysis reveals the fine-scale magnetic structures of the filament, including a compact set of mutually wrapped magnetic fields encasing the cool filament material, two groups of helical magnetic structures intertwining with the main filament, and a series of arched magnetic loops positioned along the filament. Additionally, we also find that the northern footpoints of the helical structures are rooted in the same location, while their southern footpoints are rooted in different areas. The results obtained in this study offer new insights into the formation and eruption mechanisms of solar filaments.         |

|**Abstract**|            Neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping (IM) presents great promise for future cosmological large-scale structure surveys. However, a major challenge for HIIM cosmological studies is to accurately subtract the foreground contamination. An accurate beam model is crucial for improving foreground subtraction accuracy. In this work, we develop a stacking-based beam reconstruction method utilizing the radio continuum point sources within the drift-scan field. Based on the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we employ two series of drift-scan survey data and merge the measurements to construct the beam patterns of the FAST L-band 19 feeds. To model the beams, we utilize the Zernike polynomial (ZP), which effectively captures % the side lobes and asymmetric features of the side lobes. asymmetric features of the main beam and the different side lobes. Due to the symmetric location of the beams, the main features of the beams are closely related to the distance from the center of the feed array, e.g., as the distance increases, side lobes become more pronounced. This modeling pipeline leverages the stable drift-scan data to extract beam patterns exclude the reflector's changing effects, and provides a more accurate measurement beam and a more precise model beam for FAST HIIM cosmology surveys.         |

|| T. He, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark>, <mark>J. Li</mark>, <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            Triple star systems are critical for understanding stellar dynamics and compact objects in astrophysics, yet confirmed hierarchical triples identified via spectroscopy remain limited. In this study, we identified 23 triple systems by cross-matching the Gaia DR3 non-single star catalog with LAMOST DR10 spectroscopic data; 18 of them are new discoveries. For two well-observed triples, we performed radial velocity curve fitting and light curve analysis to determine their orbital parameters, with inner and outer periods of 1.26 days and 656 days for one triple, and 3.42 days and 422 days for the other. We compared the results with other studies. We also analyzed the radial velocities (RVs) of these 23 triples, revealing a range of $V$ from approximately 40~km~s$^{-1}$ to 210~km~s$^{-1}$. Due to spectral resolution and detection limitations, velocity differences below 45~km~s$^{-1}$ in binaries and below 90~km~s$^{-1}$ in the inner binaries of triple systems are challenging to detect. Consequently, our detection range for inner orbital periods is restricted to 0.2--20 days, with the highest efficiency for periods under 10 days. These findings underscore the advantage of spectroscopic observations for identifying triple systems with short inner orbital periods.         |

|| Q. Xi, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-12-04*|

|**Abstract**|            Metallicity plays a crucial role in the evolution of massive stars and their final core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions. Integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopy can provide a spatially resolved view of SN host galaxies and serve as a powerful tool to study SN metallicities. Early transient surveys targeted bright galaxies with high star formation and SN rates; as a result, the discovered SNe are significantly biased toward high metallicities. More recently, the untargeted, wide-field transient surveys, such as ASAS-SN and ZTF, have discovered a large number of SNe without such a bias. In this work, we construct a large and unbiased sample of SNe discovered by (quasi-) untargted searches, consisting of 209 SNe of Types II (with unknown subtypes), IIP, IIn, IIb, Ib and Ic at z $\leq$ 0.02 with VLT/MUSE observations. This is currently the largest CCSN sample with IFU observations. With the strong-line method, we reveal the spatially-resolved metallicity maps of the SN host galaxies and acquire accurate metallicity measurements for the SN sites. Our results show that the SN metallicities range from 12 + log(O/H) = 8.1 to 8.7 dex, and the metallicity distributions for different SN types are very close to each other, with mean and median values of 8.4 - 8.5 dex. We carefully analysed the stochastic sampling effect, showing that our large sample size narrows the 1$\sigma$ uncertainty down to only 0.05 dex. The apparent metallicity differences among SN types are all within 3$\sigma$ uncertainties and the metallicity distributions for different SN types are all consistent with being randomly drawn from the same reference distribution. This suggests that metallicity plays a minor role in the origin of different CCSN types and some other metallicity-insensitive processes, such as binary interaction, dominate the distinction of CCSN types.         |

|**Abstract**|            Observational campaigns hunting the elusive reservoirs of cold gas in the host galaxies of quasars at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) are crucial to study the formation and evolution of the first massive systems at early epochs. We present new Northern Extended Millimetre Array (NOEMA) observations tracing CO(6--5), CO(7--6) emission lines, and the underlying continuum in five of the eight quasars at redshift $z>7$ known to date, thus completing the survey of the cold molecular gas reservoir in the host galaxies of the first quasars. Combining NOEMA observations with archival Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data available, we model the far-infrared spectral energy distribution with a modified blackbody to measure dust properties and star formation rates. We use CO and [CII] lines to derive molecular gas masses, which we compare with results from semi-analytical models and observations of galaxies at different epochs. No statistically significant detection of CO emission lines was reported for the five quasars in this sample, resulting in a relatively low amount of cold molecular gas in the host when compared with galaxies at later epochs. Nonetheless, gas-to-dust ratios are consistent with the local value, suggesting that the scaling relation between dust and cold gas holds up to $z>7$. Quasars at the EoR show star formation efficiencies which are among the highest observed so far, but comparable with that observed in luminous quasar at Cosmic Noon and that predicted for the brightest ($L_{bol}>3\times10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$) quasar objects drawn from the semi-analytical model GAEA. Quasar host galaxies at the EoR are undergoing an intense phase of star formation, which suggests a strong coupling between the luminous phase of the quasar and the rapid growth of the host.         |

|| <mark>J. Liu</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-12-04*|
|*Comments*| *10 pages, Accepted for publication in SCPMA*|
|**Abstract**|            The Taurus region is one of the most extensively studied star-forming regions. Surveys indicate that the young stars in this region are comprised of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) that cluster in groups associated with the molecular cloud (Grouped Young Stellar Objects, GYSOs), and some older ones that are sparsely distributed throughout the region (Distributed Young Stellar Objects, DYSOs). To bridge the age gap between the GYSOs ($\le$5 Myr) and the DYSOs (10-20 Myr), we conducted a survey to search for new YSOs in this direction. Based on infrared color excesses and Li I absorption lines, we identified 145 new YSOs. Combining these with the previously identified GYSOs and DYSOs, we constructed a sample of 519 YSOs that encompasses the entire region. Subsequently, we calculated the ages of the sample based on their proximity to the local bubble. The age versus Distance to the Local Bubble ($D_{\rm LB}$) relationship for the DYSOs shows a clear trend: the farther they are from the Local Bubble, the younger they are, which is consistent with the supernovae-driven formation scenario of the Local Bubble. The GYSOs also exhibit a mild age versus $D_{\rm LB}$ trend. However, they are significantly younger and are mostly confined to distances of 120 to 220 pc. Considering their distribution in the age versus $D_{\rm LB}$ space is well separated from the older DYSOs, they may also be products of the Local Bubble but formed in more recent and localized events.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report the discovery and characterization of three new transiting giant planets orbiting TOI-6628, TOI-3837 and TOI-5027, and one new warm sub-Saturn orbiting TOI-2328, whose transits events were detected in the lightcurves of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite \textbf{(TESS)} space mission. By combining TESS lightcurves with ground-based photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations we confirm the planetary nature of the observed transits and radial velocity variations. TOI-6628~$b$ has a mass of 0.75$\pm$0.06~$M_\mathrm{J}$, a radius of 0.98$\pm$0.05~$R_J$ and is orbiting a metal-rich star with a period of 18.18424$\pm{0.00001}$ days and an eccentricity of 0.667$\pm0.016$, making it one of the most eccentric orbits of all known warm giants. TOI-3837~$b$ has a mass of 0.59$\pm$0.06~$M_\mathrm{J}$, a radius of 0.96$\pm$0.05~$R_J$ and orbits its host star every 11.88865$\pm$0.00003~days, with a moderate eccentricity of 0.198$^{+0.046}_{-0.058}$. With a mass of 2.01$\pm$0.13~$M_\mathrm{J}$ and a radius of 0.99$^{+0.07}_{-0.12}$ $R_J$, TOI-5027~$b$ orbits its host star in an eccentric orbit with $e$~=~0.395$^{+0.032}_{-0.029}$ every 10.24368$\pm{0.00001}$~days. TOI-2328~$b$ is a Saturn-like planet with a mass of 0.16$\pm$0.02~$M_\mathrm{J}$ and a radius of 0.89$\pm$0.04~$R_J$, orbiting its host star in a nearly circular orbit with $e$~=~0.057$^{+0.046}_{-0.029}$ at an orbital period of 17.10197$\pm{0.00001}$ days. All four planets have orbital periods above 10 days, and our planet interior structure models are consistsent a rocky-icy core with a H/He envelope, providing evidence supporting the core accretion model of planet formation for this kind of planets.         |
