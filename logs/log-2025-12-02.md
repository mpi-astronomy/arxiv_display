|**Abstract**|            The core mass function (CMF) of prestellar cores is essential for understanding the initial conditions of star and cluster formation. However, the universality of the CMF and its relationship to the initial mass function (IMF) remain unclear. We study the CMF in the earliest stage of high-mass star formation using 461 prestellar core candidates and 254 protostellar cores as a part of the ALMA Survey of 70 \mu m Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). We find that prestellar core candidates tend to have lower masses than protostellar cores. We also find that the lifetime of prestellar cores is several times longer than the freefall time, although it approaches the freefall time as the core mass increases. The CMF, including both protostellar and prestellar cores, has a power-law slope of $-2.05\pm0.04$, shallower than Salpeter's IMF slope of -2.35. Conversely, the CMF of gravitationally bound, prestellar cores has a steeper slope ($-2.32\pm0.30$), indistinguishable from Salpeter's slope. This finding is consistent with observations in both low-mass star-forming regions and high-mass protoclusters, implying a universal core formation mechanism. The protostellar CMF with a larger maximum core mass can be reproduced by the prestellar CMF when an external gas infall is considered. The inferred mass infall rate is higher than the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate and follows a shallower mass dependence (smaller power-law index), more consistent with the tidal-lobe accretion. This may contribute to the evolution of CMFs seen in later stages.         |

|**Abstract**|            Protoplanetary disks with inner dust cavities (often referred to as "transition disks") are potential signposts of planet formation. We use Gaia astrometry to search for planetary and stellar companions in a sample of 98 transition disks, assessing the occurrence rate of such companions and their potential influence on cavity formation. For the 98 Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), we compute Gaia proper motion anomalies which, together with the RUWE, identify companions with mass ratios $q \gtrsim 0.01$ at $\sim$0.1-30 au. We assess the impact of disk gravity, accretion, disk-scattered light, dippers, starspots, jets, and outflows on the measured proper motion anomalies, concluding that astrometric techniques such as the one of this work can be robustly applied to YSOs. Significant proper motion anomalies are found in 31 transition disks (32% of the sample), indicative of companions. We recover 85% of known companions within our sensitivity range. We model the semi-major axis and mass required for a companion to reproduce the observed astrometric signals. Most inferred companions have $M > 30$ M$\rm{_{J}}$, placing many within or near the stellar mass regime. Seven sources host companions compatible with a planetary mass ($M < 13$ M$\rm{_{J}}$, HD 100453, J04343128+1722201, J16102955-3922144, MHO6, MP Mus, PDS 70, and Sz 76). For the non-detections, we provide the companion masses and semi-major axes that can be excluded in future searches. About half (53%) of detected companions cannot be reconciled with having carved the observed dust cavities. We find that transition disks host as many companions within our sensitivity range as do randomly sampled groups of YSOs and main-sequence stars. If dust cavities are shaped by companions, such companions must reside at larger orbital separations than those of the companions detected here, and we predict them to be of planetary mass.

|| E. Collaboration, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. Jahnke</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-12-02*|
|*Comments*| *21 pages, 15 figures, submitted to A&A*|
|**Abstract**|            The Euclid system performance is defined in terms of image quality metrics tuned to the weak gravitational lensing (WL) cosmological probe. WL induces stringent requirements on the shape and stability of the VIS instrument system point spread function (PSF). The PSF is affected by error contributions from the telescope, the focal plane and image motion, and is controlled by a global error budget with error allocations to each contributor. Aims. During spacecraft development, we verified through a structural-thermal-optical performance (STOP) analysis that the built and verified telescope with its spacecraft interface meets the in-orbit steady-state and transient image quality requirements. Methods. For the purposes of the STOP analysis, a detailed finite-element mathematical model was set up and a standard set of test cases, both steady-state and transient, was defined, comprising combinations of worst-case boundary conditions. Results. The STOP analysis addressed the interaction of all spacecraft components in transmitting temperature-induced loads that lead to optical train deformation. The results of the prelaunch analysis demonstrated that temperature-induced optical perturbations will be well below the allowable limits for all permitted observing conditions. During the first year in orbit, we used the STOP analysis predictions to help interpret the measured performance as a function of environmental variables. Unpredicted disturbances were discovered and unexpected sensitivities were revealed. In-orbit temperature variations are small (<300 mK) and so are their effects on the telescope structure, but they are detected in the time histories of the image quality metrics and are a non-negligible factor in the PSF stability budget demanded by the WL science. Taking everything into account, our analysis confirms the excellent overall performance of the telescope.         |

|**Abstract**|            Our comprehension of the history of star formation at $z>3$ relies on rest-frame UV observations, yet this selection misses the most dusty and massive sources, yielding an incomplete census at early times. Infrared facilities such as Spitzer and the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed a hidden population at $z=3$-$6$ with extreme red colours, named HIEROs (HST-to-IRAC extremely red objects), identified by the criterion $H_{\mathrm{E}}-\mathrm{ch2}>2.25$. Recently, Euclid Early Release Observations (ERO) have made it possible to further study such objects by comparing Euclid data with ancillary Spitzer/IRAC imaging. We investigate a $232$ arcmin$^2$ area in the Perseus field using VIS and NISP photometry, complemented by the four Spitzer channels and ground-based MegaCam bands ($u$, $g$, $r$, ${\rm H}\alpha$, $i$, $z$). Applying the colour cut yields $121$ HIEROs; after removing globular clusters, brown dwarfs, and unreliable cases through visual inspection of multiband cutouts, we obtain a final sample of $42$ robust HIEROs. Photometric redshifts and physical properties are estimated with the SED-fitting code Bagpipes. From the resulting $z_{\mathrm{phot}}$ and $M_*$ values, we compute the galaxy stellar mass function at $3.5<z<5.5$. Even after excluding possible AGN hosts or systems where the stellar mass may be overestimated, the high-mass end remains comparable to previous determinations, suggesting the true abundance could be higher. These results highlight the importance of further study of this obscured population to assess its role in the cosmic star-formation rate density and its consistency with galaxy-formation models, demonstrating Euclid's capability to advance our understanding of dust-hidden star formation across early epochs.         |

|| T. Rom, et al. -- incl., <mark>M. Schirmer</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-12-02*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            Young, massive stellar clusters offer a prime setting to explore brown dwarf (BD) formation under high densities and intense UV radiation. Trumpler 14 (Tr 14), a 1 Myr-old cluster located at a distance of 2.4 kpc, and particularly rich in O-type stars, is an ideal target for such a study. Our goal is to measure the initial mass function (IMF) in the young massive, high UV flux cluster. We present the deepest study to date of the IMF in Tr 14 based on GeMS/GSAOI imaging. We construct the IMF using both the Besancon Galactic model and an observational control field from VISTA for background correction. Completeness was assessed using artificial-star tests and applied to the IMF derivation. We estimate the IMF down to the 20% completeness limit found at 0.01 MSun. Using the control field-based IMF as our primary result, we find a slope of alpha=0.14+-0.19 for masses between 0.01-0.2 MSun, and alpha=1.72+-0.04 for 0.2-4.5 MSun. The low-mass slope is largely influenced by the incompleteness-affected lowest bin; excluding it brings our results into agreement with those from other young clusters. The resulting median for the star-to-BD ratio in the 0.03-1 MSun mass range is 4.0, with a 95% confidence interval of 2.8-5.8. Our analysis reveals that Tr 14 hosts a relatively flat substellar IMF, but this is strongly influenced by the lowest-mass bin, which may be affected by incompleteness. When that bin is excluded, the IMF becomes consistent with those of other regions. The star-to-BD ratio falls within the usually observed 3-6 range, indicating that brown dwarfs with masses above 0.03 MSun form with similar efficiency across environments. However, the relative lack of objects below this threshold suggests that the presence of an environment with both high stellar density and FUV flux may play a role in shaping the IMF by suppressing the formation of BDs at masses < 0.03 MSun.         |

|| <mark>N. Wang</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-12-02*|
|*Comments*| *25 pages, 4 tables, 7 figures, accepted for publication in JHEAp*|
|**Abstract**|            Based on the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), we selected 10 blazars as our sample sources. Among these, we found four blazars (J 0923.5+4125, J 1221.3+3010, J 1503.5+4759, and J 1652.7+4024) showing possible indications of quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs) modulation. We conducted a detailed analysis of their optical light curves (g- and r-bands) over the past five years using the root mean square (RMS)-Flux relation, flux distribution, and QPO detection methods to investigate their variability characteristics. A linear RMS-Flux relation is present in both bands, and their flux distributions follow a log-normal form. This suggests that optical variability may arise from multiplicative, nonlinear processes across different timescales and flux states. Further QPO analysis using the weighted wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) methods identified candidate periodic signals in four blazars. J 0923.5+4125 (period $\sim$ 205 days) and J 1221.3+3010 ($\sim$ 630 days) show local significances of $\sim 3 \sigma$, whereas J 1503.5+4759 ($\sim$ 38.5 days) and J 1652.7+4024 ($\sim$ 48 days) reach $\sim 4 \sigma$. After accounting for the look-elsewhere effect, the global significances for J 1503.5+4759 in the g- and r-bands are $\sim 2.7 \sigma$, while for J 1652.7+4024 they are approximately $\sim 2.5 \sigma$ in both bands. These two blazars warrant further monitoring and investigation.         |
