|**Abstract**| This work analyses the present-day mass function (PDMF) of 93~star clusters utilizing Gaia DR3 data, with membership determined by the StarGo machine learning algorithm. The impact of unresolved binary systems on mass estimation is rigorously assessed, adopting three mass ratio profiles for correction. The PDMF is characterized by the power-law index, $\alpha$, derived through a robust maximum likelihood method that avoids biases associated with data binning. The value of $\alpha$ for stars between the completeness limited mass of Gaia with a mean 0.3 $M_\odot$ for our cluster samples and 2 $M_\odot$, exhibits stability for clusters younger than 200 Myr, decreasing for older clusters, particularly when considering stars within the half-mass radius. The PDMF of these star clusters is consistent with a dynamically evolved Kroupa IMF via the loss of low-mass stars. Cluster morphology shows a correlation with $\alpha$, as $\alpha$ values exhibit a decreasing trend from filamentary to tidal-tail clusters, mirroring the sequence of increasing cluster age. The dependence of $\alpha$ on total cluster mass is weak, with a subtle increase for higher-mass clusters, especially outside the half-mass radius. We do not observe a correlation between $\alpha$ and the mean metallicity of the clusters. Younger clusters have lower metallicity compared to their older counterparts, which indicates that the older clusters might have migrated to the solar neighbourhood from the inner disk. A comparison with numerical models incorporating a black hole population suggests the need for observations of distant, older, massive open clusters to determine whether or not they contain black holes. |

|**Abstract**| The study of protoplanetary disks has become increasingly important with the Kepler satellite finding that exoplanets are ubiquitous around stars in our galaxy and the discovery of enormous diversity in planetary system architectures and planet properties. High-resolution near-IR and ALMA images show strong evidence for ongoing planet formation in young disks. The JWST MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS) aims to (1) investigate the chemical inventory in the terrestrial planet-forming zone across stellar spectral type, (2) follow the gas evolution into the disk dispersal stage, and (3) study the structure of protoplanetary and debris disks in the thermal mid-IR. The MINDS survey will thus build a bridge between the chemical inventory of disks and the properties of exoplanets. The survey comprises 52 targets (Herbig Ae stars, T Tauri stars, very low-mass stars and young debris disks). We primarily obtain MIRI/MRS spectra with high S/N (~100-500) covering the complete wavelength range from 4.9 to 27.9 {\mu}m. For a handful of selected targets we also obtain NIRSpec IFU high resolution spectroscopy (2.87-5.27 {\mu}m). We will search for signposts of planet formation in thermal emission of micron-sized dust - information complementary to near-IR scattered light emission from small dust grains and emission from large dust in the submillimeter wavelength domain. We will also study the spatial structure of disks in three key systems that have shown signposts for planet formation, TW Hya and HD 169142 using the MIRI coronagraph at 15.5 {\mu}m and 10.65 {\mu}m respectively and PDS70 using NIRCam imaging in the 1.87 {\mu}m narrow and the 4.8 {\mu}m medium band filter. ... |

|**Abstract**| The atmosphere of Triton was probed directly by observing a ground-based stellar occultation on 6 October 2022. This rare event yielded 23 positive light curves collected from 13 separate observation stations contributing to our campaign. The significance of this event lies in its potential to directly validate the modest pressure fluctuation on Triton, a phenomenon not definitively verified by previous observations, including only five stellar occultations, and the Voyager 2 radio occultation in 1989. Using an approach consistent with a comparable study, we precisely determined a surface pressure of $14.07_{-0.13}^{+0.21}~\mathrm{\mu bar}$ in 2022. This new pressure rules out any significant monotonic variation in pressure between 2017 and 2022 through direct observations, as it is in alignment with the 2017 value. Additionally, both the pressures in 2017 and 2022 align with the 1989 value. This provides further support for the conclusion drawn from the previous volatile transport model simulation, which is consistent with the observed alignment between the pressures in 1989 and 2017; that is to say, the pressure fluctuation is modest. Moreover, this conclusion suggests the existence of a northern polar cap extended down to at least $45^\circ$N$-60^\circ$N and the presence of nitrogen between $30^\circ$S and $0^\circ$. |

|| <mark>X. Zhang</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-03-15*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**| We examine the fundamental plane of 91 Blazars which include FSRQs and BL Lacs with known X-ray luminosity ($L_{R}$), radio luminosity ($L_X$), and black hole mass measurements ($M$) to reflect the relationship between jet and accretion for blazars. The fundamental plane of Blazars are log$L_{R}$=${0.273}_{+0.059}^{-0.059}$log$L_X$+${0.695}_{+0.191}^{-0.191}$log$M$+${25.457}_{+2.728}^{-2.728}$ and log$L_{R}$=${0.190}_{+0.049}^{-0.049}$log$L_X$+${0.475}_{+0.157}^{-0.157}$log$M$+${28.568}_{+2.245}^{-2.245}$ after considering the effect of beam factor. Our results suggest that the jet of blazars has connection with accretion. We set the black hole spin energy as a new variable to correct the black hole mass and explore the effect of black hole spin on the fundamental relationship. We find that the fundamental plane of Blazars is effected by the black hole spin, which is similar to the previous work for AGNs. We additionally examine a new fundamental plane which is based on the black hole spin-mass energy ($M_{spin}$). The new fundamental plane (log$L_{R}$=${0.332}_{+0.081}^{-0.081}$log$L_X$+${0.502}_{+0.091}^{-0.091}$log$M_{spin}$+${22.606}_{+3.346}^{-3.346}$ with R-Square=0.575) shows that $M_{spin}$ has a better correlation coefficient comparing to the $M$ for fundamental plane of Blazars. These results support that the black hole spin should be considered as a important factor for the study of fundamental plane for Blazars. And these may further our understanding of the Blandford-Znajek process in blazars. |
