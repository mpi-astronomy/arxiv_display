|**Abstract**|            We present the detection and characterization of TOI-4994b (TIC 277128619b), a warm Saturn-sized planet discovered by the NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). TOI-4994b transits a G-type star (V = 12.6 mag) with a mass, radius, and effective temperature of $M_{\star} =1.005^{+0.064}_{-0.061} M_{\odot}$, $R_{\star} = 1.055^{+0.040}_{-0.037} R_{\odot}$, and $T_{\rm eff} = 5640 \pm 110$ K. We obtained follow-up ground-based photometry from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) and the Antarctic Search for Transiting ExoPlanets (ASTEP) telescopes, and we confirmed the planetary nature of TOI-4994b with multiple radial velocity observations from the PFS, CHIRON, HARPS, FEROS, and CORALIE instruments. From a global fit to the photometry and radial velocities, we determine that TOI-4994b is in a 21.5-day, eccentric orbit ($e = 0.32 \pm 0.04$) and has a mass of $M_{P}= 0.280^{+0.037}_{-0.034} M_{J}$, a radius of $R_{P}= 0.762^{+0.030}_{-0.027}R_{J}$, and a Saturn-like bulk density of $\rho_{p} = 0.78^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ $\rm g/cm^3$. We find that TOI-4994 is a potentially viable candidate for follow-up stellar obliquity measurements. TOI-4994b joins the small sample of warm Saturn analogs and thus sheds light on our understanding of these rare and unique worlds.         |

|**Abstract**|            JWST observations have unveiled faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high-redshift that provide insights on the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their coevolution with galaxies. However, disentangling stellar from AGN light in these sources is challenging. Here, we use an empirical approach to infer the average stellar mass of 6 faint broad line (BL) Halpha emitters at z = 4 - 5 with BH masses ~ 6 (4 - 15)x10^6 Msun, with a method independent of their spectral energy distribution (SED). We use the deep JWST/NIRcam grism survey ALT to measure the over-densities around BL-Halpha emitters and around a spectroscopic reference sample of ~300 galaxies. In our reference sample, we find that Mpc-scale over-density correlates with stellar mass, while pair counts are flat below ~50 kpc due to satellites. Their large-scale environments suggest that BL-Halpha emitters are hosted by galaxies with stellar masses ~5x10^7 Msun, ~40 times lower than those inferred from galaxy-only SED fits. Adding measurements around more luminous z~6 AGNs, we find tentative correlations between line width, BH mass and the over-density, suggestive of a steep BH to halo mass relation. The main implications are (1) when BH masses are taken at face value, we confirm extremely high BH to stellar mass ratios of ~10 %, (2) the low stellar mass galaxies hosting growing SMBHs are in tension with typical hydrodynamical simulations, except those without feedback, (3) a 1 % duty cycle implied by the host mass hints at super-Eddington accretion, which may imply over-estimated SMBH masses, (4) the masses are at odds with a high stellar density interpretation of the line broadening, (5) our results imply a diversity of galaxy masses, environments and SEDs among AGN samples, depending on their luminosity.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report JWST NIRSpec/G395H observations of TOI-1685 b, a hot rocky super-Earth orbiting an M2.5V star, during a full orbit. We obtain transmission and emission spectra of the planet and characterize the properties of the phase curve, including its amplitude and offset. The transmission spectrum rules out clear H$_2$-dominated atmospheres, while secondary atmospheres (made of water, methane, or carbon dioxide) cannot be statistically distinguished from a flat line. The emission spectrum is featureless and consistent with a blackbody-like brightness temperature, helping rule out thick atmospheres with high mean molecular weight. Collecting all evidence, the properties of TOI-1685 b are consistent with a blackbody with no heat redistribution and a low albedo, with a dayside brightness temperature 0.98$\pm$0.07 times that of a perfect blackbody in the NIRSpec NRS2 wavelength range (3.823-5.172 um). Our results add to the growing number of seemingly airless M-star rocky planets, thus constraining the location of the "Cosmic Shoreline". Three independent data reductions have been carried out, all showing a high-amplitude correlated noise component in the white and spectroscopic light curves. The correlated noise properties are different between the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors - importantly the timescales of the strongest components (4.5 hours and 2.5 hours, respectively) - suggesting the noise is from instrumental rather than astrophysical origins. We encourage the community to look into the systematics of NIRSpec for long time-series observations.         |

|| Z. L. Yang, et al. -- incl., <mark>L. Xie</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            Binary millisecond pulsars with a massive white dwarf (WD) companion are intermediate-mass binary pulsars (IMBPs). They are formed via the Case BB Roche-lobe overflow (RLO) evolution channel if they are in compact orbits with an orbital period of less than 1 day. They are fairly rare in the known pulsar population, only five such IMBPs have been discovered before, and one of them is in a globular cluster. Here we report six IMBPs in a compact orbit, PSRs J0416+5201, J0520+3722, J1919+1341, J1943+2210, J1947+2304 and J2023+2853, discovered during the Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot (GPPS) survey by using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), doubling the number of such IMBPs due to the high survey sensitivity in the short survey time of 5 minutes. Follow-up timing observations show that they all have either a CO WD or an ONeMg WD companion with a mass greater than about 0.8~M$_\odot$ in a very circular orbit with an eccentricity in the order of $\lesssim10^{-5}$. PSR J0416+5201 should be an ONeMg WD companion with a remarkable minimum mass of 1.28 M$_\odot$. These massive white dwarf companions lead to a detectable Shapiro delay for PSRs J0416+5201, J0520+3722, J1943+2210, and J2023+2853, indicating that their orbits are highly inclined. From the measurement of the Shapiro delay, the pulsar mass of J1943+2210 was constrained to be 1.84$^{\,+0.11}_{-0.09}$~M$_\odot$, and that of PSR J2023+2853 to be 1.28$^{\,+0.06}_{-0.05}$~M$_\odot$.         |
