|**Abstract**|            We introduce the Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP) for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) Local Volume Mapper (LVM) project, referred to as the LVM-DAP. We outline our methods for recovering both stellar and emission line components from the optical integral field spectroscopy, highlighting the developments and changes implemented to address specific challenges of the data set. The observations from the LVM project are unique because they cover a wide range of physical resolutions, from approximately 0.05 pc to 100 pc, depending on the distance to the targets. This, along with the varying number of stars sampled in each aperture (ranging from zero, just one of a few, to thousands), presents challenges in using previous spectral synthesis methods and interpreting the spectral fits. We provide a detailed explanation of how we model the stellar content and separate it from the ionized gas emission lines. To assess the accuracy of our results, we compare them with both idealized and more realistic simulations, highlighting the limitations of our methods. We find that the DAP robustly correct for stellar continuum features and recover emission line parameters (e.g. flux, equivalent width, systemtic velocity and velocity dispersion) with a precision and accuracy that fulfill the requirements of the primary goal of the analysis. In addition, the recovered stellar parameters are reliable for single stars, the recovery of integrated populations is less precise. We conclude with a description of the data products we provide, instructions for downloading and using our software, and a showcase illustrating the quality of the data and the analysis on a deep exposure taken on the Huygens region at the center of the Orion Nebula.         |

|**Abstract**|            The mass of galaxy clusters is a critical quantity for probing cluster cosmology and testing theories of gravity, but its measurement could be biased given assumptions are inevitable. In this paper, we employ and compare two mass proxies for galaxy clusters: thermodynamics of the intracluster medium and kinematics of member galaxies. We select 22 galaxy clusters from the cluster catalog in the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) that have sufficient optical and near-infrared observations. We generate multi-band images in the energy range of (0.3, 7) keV for each cluster, and derive their temperature profiles, gas mass profiles and hydrostatic mass profiles using a parametric approach that does not assume dark matter halo models. With spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies collected from multiple surveys, we numerically solve the spherical Jeans equation for their dynamical mass profiles. Our results quantify the correlation between dynamical mass and line-of-sight velocity dispersion with an rms scatter of 0.14 dex. We find the two mass proxies lead to roughly the same total mass, with no observed systematic bias. As such, the $\sigma_8$ tension is not specific to hydrostatic mass or weak lensing shears, but also appears with galaxy kinematics. We also compare our hydrostatic masses with the latest weak lensing masses inferred with scaling relations. The comparison shows the weak lensing mass is significantly higher than our hydrostatic mass by $\sim$110%. This might explain the significantly larger value of $\sigma_8$ from the latest measurement using eRASS1 clusters than almost all previous estimates in the literature. Finally, we test the radial acceleration relation (RAR) established in disk galaxies. We confirm the missing baryon problem in the inner region of galaxy clusters using three independent mass proxies for the first time.         |

|**Abstract**|            Accurate, precise, and computationally efficient removal of unwanted activity that exists as a combination of periodic, quasi-periodic, and non-periodic systematic trends in time-series photometric data is a critical step in exoplanet transit analysis. Throughout the years, many different modeling methods have been used for this process, often called "detrending." However, there is no community-wide consensus regarding the favored approach. In order to mitigate model dependency, we present an ensemble-based approach to detrending via community-of-models and the $\texttt{democratic detrender}$: a modular and scalable open-source coding package that implements ensemble detrending. The $\texttt{democratic detrender}$ allows users to select from a number of packaged detrending methods (including cosine filtering, Gaussian processes, and polynomial fits) or provide their own set of detrended light curves via methods of their choosing. The $\texttt{democratic detrender}$ then combines the resulting individually detrended light curves into a single method marginalized (via median selection) light curve. Additionally, the $\texttt{democratic detrender}$ inflates the uncertainties of each time-series data point using information from the median absolute deviation between the individually detrended light curve, propagating information into the final detrended light curve about the added uncertainty due to the correctness of the underlying models.         |

|| Y. Wu, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. El-Badry</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-18*|
|*Comments*| *6 pages + 7 appendixes; submitted to ApJ Letters*|
|**Abstract**|            Orbits of stellar binaries are in general eccentric. This encodes information about the formation process. Here, we use thousands of main-sequence binaries from the GAIA DR3 catalog to reveal that, binaries inwards of a few AU exhibit a simple Rayleigh distribution with a mode $\sigma_e \simeq 0.30$. We find the same distribution for binaries from M to A spectral types, and from tens of days to $10^3$days (possibly extending to tens of AU). This observed distribution is most likely primordial. Its Rayleigh form suggests an origin in weak scattering, while its invariant mode demands a universal process. We experiment with exciting binary eccentricities by ejecting brown dwarfs, and find that the eccentricities reach an equi-partition value of $\sigma_e \simeq \sqrt{M_{\rm bd}/M_*}$. So to explain the observed mode, these brown dwarfs will have to be of order one tenth the stellar masses, and be at least as abundant in the Galaxy as the close binaries. The veracity of such a proposal remains to be tested.         |
