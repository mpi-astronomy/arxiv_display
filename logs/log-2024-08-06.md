|**Abstract**|            A key scientific goal of exoplanet surveys is to characterize the underlying population of planets in the local galaxy. In particular, the properties of accreting protoplanets can inform the rates and physical processes of planet formation. We develop a novel method to compute sensitivity to protoplanets in emission-line direct-imaging surveys, enabling estimates of protoplanet population properties under various planetary accretion and formation theories. In this work, we specialize to the case of H-alpha and investigate three formation models governing the planetary-mass-to-mass-accretion-rate power law, and two accretion models that describe the scaling between total accretion luminosity and observable H-alpha line luminosity. We apply our method to the results of the Magellan Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey (GAPlanetS) to place the first constraints on accreting companion occurrence rates in systems with transitional circumstellar disks. We compute the posterior probability for transitional disk systems to host an accreting companion (-8< log MMdot MJ^2/yr < -2) within 2 arcseconds (~200 au). Across accretion models, we find consistent accreting companion rates, with median and one-sigma credible intervals of 0.15 (+0.18, -0.10) and 0.19 (+0.23, -0.12). Our technique enables studying protoplanet populations under flexible assumptions about planet formation. This formalism provides the statistical underpinning necessary for protoplanet surveys to discriminate among formation and accretion theories for planets and brown dwarfs.         |

|**Abstract**|            The dust- and gas-rich protoplanetary disks around young stellar systems play a key role in star and planet formation. While considerable progress has recently been made in probing these disks on large scales of a few tens of astronomical units (au), the central au needs to be more investigated. We aim at unveiling the physical processes at play in the innermost regions of the strongly accreting T Tauri Star S CrA N by means of near-infrared interferometric observations. The K-band continuum emission is well reproduced with an azimuthally-modulated dusty ring. As the star alone cannot explain the size of this sublimation front, we propose that magnetospheric accretion is an important dust-heating mechanism leading to this continuum emission. The differential analysis of the Hydrogen Br$\gamma$ line is in agreement with radiative transfer models combining magnetospheric accretion and disk winds. Our observations support an origin of the Br$\gamma$ line from a combination of (variable) accretion-ejection processes in the inner disk region.         |

|| Q.-M. Fu, <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-08-06*|
|*Comments*| *11 pages, 2 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            We investigate the linear cosmological perturbations in the context of the so-called energy-momentum squared gravity (EMSG) theory. Recent researches show that the EMSG theory can reproduce viable background cosmological evolution comparable to $\Lambda$CDM, while the matter-dominated era exhibits slight distinctions. In this paper, we mainly focus on the power-law EMSG models and derive the equations for the linear cosmological perturbations. We explore the propagation of the gravitational wave (GW) and the growth of matter density perturbation at the first order, and estimate the model parameters from the simulated GW data and the observed redshift space distortion data. Our analysis reveals that the model parameters should be small and positive in $1\sigma$ confidence interval, which indicates that the theory is in good agreement with the observational data and can be regarded as an alternative for the standard cosmological model.         |

|| Y. Huang, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-08-06*|
|*Comments*| *31 pages, 20 figures, 3 tables, accepeted by ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            We present a catalog of stellar parameters (effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$, surface gravity $\log g$, age, and metallicity [Fe/H]) and elemental-abundance ratios ([C/Fe], [Mg/Fe], and [$\alpha$/Fe]) for some five million stars (4.5 million dwarfs and 0.5 million giants stars) in the Milky Way, based on stellar colors from the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) DR3 and \textit{Gaia} EDR3. These estimates are obtained through the construction of a large spectroscopic training set with parameters and abundances adjusted to uniform scales, and trained with a Kernel Principal Component Analysis. Owing to the seven narrow/medium-band filters employed by J-PLUS, we obtain precisions in the abundance estimates that are as good or better than derived from medium-resolution spectroscopy for stars covering a wide range of the parameter space: 0.10-0.20 dex for [Fe/H] and [C/Fe], and 0.05 dex for [Mg/Fe] and [$\alpha$/Fe]. Moreover, systematic errors due to the influence of molecular carbon bands on previous photometric-metallicity estimates (which only included two narrow/medium-band blue filters) have now been removed, resulting in photometric-metallicity estimates down to [Fe/H] $\sim -4.0$, with typical uncertainties of 0.25 dex and 0.40 dex for dwarfs and giants, respectively. This large photometric sample should prove useful for the exploration of the assembly and chemical-evolution history of our Galaxy.         |

|| A. Levitskiy, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-08-06*|
|*Comments*| *39 Pages, 18 Figures*|
|**Abstract**|            We set the stage for reassessing how star formation, emission-line nebulae, and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) depend on the thermodynamics of the intracluster medium (ICM). Our work is based on the 25 clusters observed in the CLASH program for which the aforementioned attributes in their BCGs can be well scrutinized, as has the thermodynamics of their ICM. Nine of these BCGs display complex UV morphologies tracing recent star formation, whereas the remaining 16 are characterized by a relatively compact central UV enhancement. Here, we show definitively that three of the latter BCGs also display star formation, whereas the diffuse UV of the remaining 13 is entirely consistent with old low-mass stars. The overall results support the previously established dependence of star formation and nebulae in BCGs on an "excess core entropy," K$_{0}$, for the ICM: all 11 clusters with K$_{0}$ $\leq$ 24 keV cm$^{2}$ (but only one of 14 clusters with K$_{0}$ $\geq$ 42 keV cm$^{2}$) host star-forming BCGs that almost if not always possess nebulae. Instead of an entropy floor, we show that K$_{0}$ reflects the degree to which the radial entropy profile decreases inward within $\sim$100 kpc rather than (except perhaps at large K$_{0}$) actually flattening: clusters with lower ICM entropies and hence shorter cooling times at their cores preferentially host BCGs displaying star formation, nebulae, and more radio-luminous AGNs. Nearly all BCGs possess detectable AGNs, however, indicating multiple pathways for fuelling their AGNs.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope (LST) on board the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) is the first payload to image the full solar disk and the solar corona in both white-light (WL) and ultraviolet (UV) H I Lya, extending up to 2.5 solar radii (Rs). Since the launch of the ASO-S on 9 October 2022, LST has captured various significant solar activities including flares, prominences, coronal mass ejections (CMEs). LST covers different passbands of 121.6 nm, 360 nm and 700 nm. The Lya Solar Disk Imager (SDI) has a field of view (FOV) of 38.4 arcmin and a spatial resolution of around 9.5 arcsec, while the White-Light Solar Telescope (WST) has a FOV of 38.43 arcmin and a spatial resolution of around 3.0 arcsec. The FOV of the Lya Solar Corona Imager (SCI) reaches 81.1 arcmin and its spatial resolution is 4.3 arcsec. The stray-light level in the 700 nm waveband is about 7.8e-6 MSB (mean solar brightness) at 1.1 Rs and 7.6e-7 MSB at 2.5 Rs, and in the Lya waveband it is around 4.3e-3 MSB at 1.1 Rs and 4.1e-4 MSB at 2.5 Rs. This article will detail the results from on-orbit tests and calibrations.         |
