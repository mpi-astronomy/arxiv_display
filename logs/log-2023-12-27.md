|**Abstract**| This paper investigates the problem of estimating three stellar atmospheric physical parameters and thirteen elemental abundances for medium-resolution spectra from Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). Typical characteristics of these spectra are their huge scale, wide range of spectral signal-to-noise ratios, and uneven distribution in parameter space.These characteristics lead to unsatisfactory results on the spectra with low temperature, high temperature or low metallicity.To this end, this paper proposes a Stellar Parameter Estimation method based on Multiple Regions (SPEMR) that effectively improves parameter estimation accuracy. On the spectra with {S/N $\geq 10$}, the precisions are 47 K, 0.08 dex, 0.03 dex respectively for the estimations of ($T_{\rm eff}$, $\log \,g$ and $\rm [Fe/H]$), 0.03 dex to 0.06 dex for elements C, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Mn and Ni, 0.07 dex to 0.13 dex for N, O, S, K and Ti, while that of Cr is 0.16 dex.For the reference of astronomical science researchers and algorithm researchers, we released a catalog for 4.19 million medium-resolution spectra from the LAMOST DR8, experimental code, trained model, training data, and test data. |

|**Abstract**| We present a measurement of the low-mass quiescent size-mass relation at Cosmic Noon (1<z<3) from the JWST PRIMER and UNCOVER treasury surveys, which highlight two distinct classes of quiescent galaxies. While the massive population is well studied at these redshifts, the low-mass end has been previously under-explored due to a lack of observing facilities with sufficient sensitivity and spatial resolution (in the rest-frame near-IR). We select a conservative sample of robust low-mass quiescent galaxy candidates using rest-frame UVJ colors and specific star formation rate criteria and measure galaxy morphology in both rest-frame UV/optical wavelengths (F150W) and rest-frame near-infrared (F444W). We confirm an unambiguous "flattening" of the low-mass quiescent size-mass relation, which results from the separation of the quiescent galaxy sample into two distinct populations at $\log(M_\star/M_\odot)\sim10.3$: low-mass quiescent galaxies that are notably younger and have disky structures, and massive galaxies with prolate morphologies and older median stellar ages. These separate populations imply mass quenching dominates at the massive end while other mechanisms, such as environmental or feedback-driven quenching, form the low-mass end. This stellar mass dependent slope of the quiescent size-mass relation could also indicate a shift from size growth due to star formation (low masses) to growth via mergers (massive galaxies). The transition mass between these two populations also corresponds with other dramatic changes in galaxy evolutions (e.g. star-formation efficiency, dust obscuration, and stellar-halo mass ratios), further highlighting the stark dichotomy between low-mass and massive galaxy formation. |
