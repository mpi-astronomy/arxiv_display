|**Abstract**| At fixed galaxy stellar mass, there is a clear observational connection between structural asymmetry and offset from the star forming main sequence, $\Delta$SFMS. Herein, we use the TNG50 simulation to investigate the relative roles of major mergers (stellar mass ratios $\mu\geq0.25$), minor ($0.1 \leq \mu < 0.25$), and mini mergers ($0.01 \leq \mu < 0.1$) in driving this connection amongst star forming galaxies (SFGs). We use dust radiative transfer post-processing with SKIRT to make a large, public collection of synthetic Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) images of simulated TNG galaxies over $0.1\leq z \leq 0.7$ with $\log M_{\star} / \mathrm{M}_{\odot}\geq9$ ($\sim750$k images). Using their instantaneous SFRs, known merger histories/forecasts, and HSC-SSP asymmetries, we show (1) that TNG50 SFGs qualitatively reproduce the observed trend between $\Delta$SFMS and asymmetry and (2) a strikingly similar trend emerges between $\Delta$SFMS and the time-to-coalescence for mini mergers. Controlling for redshift, stellar mass, environment, and gas fraction, we show that individual mini merger events yield small enhancements in SFRs and asymmetries that are sustained on long timescales (at least $\sim3$ Gyr after coalescence, on average) -- in contrast to major/minor merger remnants which peak at much greater amplitudes but are consistent with controls only $\sim1$ Gyr after coalescence. Integrating the boosts in SFRs and asymmetries driven by $\mu\geq0.01$ mergers since $z=0.7$ in TNG50 SFGs, we show that mini mergers are responsible for (i) $55$ per cent of all merger-driven star formation and (ii) $70$ per cent of merger-driven asymmetric structure. Due to their relative frequency and prolonged boost timescales, mini mergers dominate over their minor and major counterparts in driving star formation and asymmetry in SFGs. |

|**Abstract**| The origin of the elevated C/O ratios in discs around late M dwarfs compared to discs around solar-type stars is not well understood. Here we endeavour to reproduce the observed differences in the disc C/O ratios as a function of stellar mass using a viscosity-driven disc evolution model and study the corresponding atmospheric composition of planets that grow inside the water-ice line in these discs. We carried out simulations using a coupled disc evolution and planet formation code that includes pebble drift and evaporation. We used a chemical partitioning model for the dust composition in the disc midplane. Inside the water-ice line, the disc's C/O ratio initially decreases to sub-stellar due to the inward drift and evaporation of water-ice-rich pebbles before increasing again to super-stellar values due to the inward diffusion of carbon-rich vapour. We show that this process is more efficient for very low-mass stars compared to solar-type stars due to the closer-in ice lines and shorter disc viscous timescales. In high-viscosity discs, the transition from sub-stellar to super-stellar takes place faster due to the fast inward advection of carbon-rich gas. Our results suggest that planets accreting their atmospheres early (when the disc C/O is still sub-stellar) will have low atmospheric C/O ratios, while planets that accrete their atmospheres late (when the disc C/O has become super-stellar) can obtain high C/O ratios. Our model predictions are consistent with observations, under the assumption that all stars have the same metallicity and chemical composition, and that the vertical mixing timescales in the inner disc are much shorter than the radial advection timescales. This further strengthens the case for considering stellar abundances alongside disc evolution in future studies that aim to link planet (atmospheric) composition to disc composition. |
