|**Abstract**|            Understanding how and why star formation varies between galaxies is fundamental to our comprehension of galaxy evolution. In particular, the star-formation efficiency (SFE; star-formation rate or SFR per unit cold gas mass) has been shown to vary substantially both across and within galaxies. Early-type galaxies (ETGs) constitute an extreme case, as about a quarter have detectable molecular gas reservoirs but little to no detectable star formation. In this work, we present a spatially-resolved view of the SFE in ten ETGs, combining state-of-the-art Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations. Optical spectroscopic line diagnostics are used to identify the ionized emission regions dominated by star-formation, and reject regions where the ionization arises primarily from other sources. We identify very few regions where the ionization is consistent with pure star formation. Using ${\rm H}\alpha$ as our SFR tracer, we find that previous integrated measurements of the star-formation rate based on UV and 22$\mu$m emission are systematically higher than the SFR measured from ${\rm H}\alpha$. However, for the small number of regions where ionization is primarily associated with star formation, the SFEs are around 0.4 dex higher than those measured in star-forming galaxies at a similar spatial resolution (with depletion times ranging from $10^8$ to $10^{10}$ yr). Whilst the SFE of ETGs is overall low, we find that the SFEs of individual regions within ETGs can be similar to, or higher than, similar sized regions within star-forming galaxies.         |

|**Abstract**|            The intracluster light (ICL) permeating galaxy clusters is a tracer of the cluster's assembly history, and potentially a tracer of their dark matter structure. In this work we explore the capability of the Euclid Wide Survey to detect ICL using H-band mock images. We simulate clusters across a range of redshifts (0.3-1.8) and halo masses ($10^{13.9}$-$10^{15.0}$ M$_\odot$), using an observationally motivated model of the ICL. We identify a 50-200 kpc circular annulus around the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in which the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the ICL is maximised and use the S/N within this aperture as our figure of merit for ICL detection. We compare three state-of-the-art methods for ICL detection, and find that a method that performs simple aperture photometry after high-surface brightness source masking is able to detect ICL with minimal bias for clusters more massive than $10^{14.2}$ M$_\odot$. The S/N of the ICL detection is primarily limited by the redshift of the cluster, driven by cosmological dimming, rather than the mass of the cluster. Assuming the ICL in each cluster contains 15% of the stellar light, we forecast that Euclid will be able to measure the presence of ICL in up to $\sim80000$ clusters of $>10^{14.2}$ M$_\odot$ between $z=0.3$ and 1.5 with a S/N$>3$. Half of these clusters will reside below $z=0.75$ and the majority of those below $z=0.6$ will be detected with a S/N $>20$. A few thousand clusters at $1.3<z<1.5$ will have ICL detectable with a S/N greater than 3. The surface brightness profile of the ICL model is strongly dependent on both the mass of the cluster and the redshift at which it is observed so the outer ICL is best observed in the most massive clusters of $>10^{14.7}$ M$_\odot$. Euclid will detect the ICL at more than 500 kpc distance from the BCG, up to $z=0.7$, in several hundred of these massive clusters over its large survey volume.         |

|**Abstract**|            JWST observations, when combined with HST data, promise to improve age estimates of star clusters in nearby spiral galaxies. However, feedback from young cluster stars pushes out the natal gas and dust, making cluster formation and evolution a challenge to model. Here, we use JWST + HST observations of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628 to produce spectral energy distribution (SED) templates of compact star clusters spanning 275 nm through 21 {\mu}m. These preliminary SEDs capture the cluster stars and associated gas and dust within radii of 0.12" to 0.67" (corresponding to 6 to 33 pc at the distance of NGC 628). One important finding is that the SEDs of 1, 2, 3, and 4 Myr clusters can be differentiated in the infrared. Another is that in 80-90% of the cases we study, the PAH and H_alpha emission track one another, with the dust responsible for the 3.3 {\mu}m PAH emission largely removed by 4 Myr, consistent with pre-supernova stellar feedback acting quickly on the surrounding gas and dust. Nearly-embedded cluster candidates have infrared SEDs which are quite similar to optically visible 1 to 3 Myr clusters. In nearly all cases we find there is a young star cluster within a few tenths of an arcsec (10 - 30 pc) of the nearly embedded cluster, suggesting the formation of the cluster was triggered by its presence. The resulting age estimates from the empirical templates are compatible both with dynamical estimates based on CO superbubble expansion velocities, and the TODDLERS models which track spherical evolution of homogeneous gas clouds around young stellar clusters.         |

|**Abstract**|            The PHANGS project is assembling a comprehensive, multi-wavelength dataset of nearby (~5-20 Mpc), massive star-forming galaxies to enable multi-phase, multi-scale investigations into the processes that drive star formation and galaxy evolution. To date, large survey programs have provided molecular gas (CO) cubes with ALMA, optical IFU spectroscopy with VLT/MUSE, high-resolution NUV--optical imaging in five broad-band filters with HST, and infrared imaging in NIRCAM+MIRI filters with JWST. Here, we present PHANGS-HST-Halpha, which has obtained high-resolution (~2-10 pc), narrow-band imaging in the F658N or F657N filters with the HST/WFC3 camera of the warm ionized gas in the first 19 nearby galaxies observed in common by all four of the PHANGS large programs. We summarize our data reduction process, with a detailed discussion of the production of flux-calibrated, Milky Way extinction corrected, continuum-subtracted Halpha maps. PHANGS-MUSE IFU spectroscopy data are used to background subtract the HST-Halpha maps, and to determine the [NII] correction factors for each galaxy. We describe our public data products and highlight a few key science cases enabled by the PHANGS-HST-Halpha observations.         |

|**Abstract**|            As part of the HIERACHY program, we collect the high-SN and high-spectral resolution optical spectra of 25 quasars at $z\approx4-5$ to constrain the C IV evolution at $z\approx 3-5$. In this paper, we report a catalog of 626 (1263) C IV absorption systems (components) at $z\approx3-5$ with a 50% completeness column density of log$(N_{\rm CIV}/\rm cm^{-2}) \approx 12.3$. The HIERACHY/MIKE C IV sample is one of the best C IV absorber samples optimized to study the IGM during the He II reionization epoch. Using 557 (1090) intervening absorption systems (components), we found the column density distribution function of C IV absorption systems with log$(N_{\rm CIV}/\rm cm^{-2})\gtrsim 12.3$ has a broken power-law shape, with the turn-over column density log$(N_{\rm crit}/\rm cm^{-2}) = 13.35^{+0.20}_{-0.19}$, which is close to or smaller than the detection limit of most literature samples. We also found that both comoving path length number density $dn/dX$ and cosmic abundance $\Omega$ for C IV absorption systems with log$(N_{\rm CIV}/\rm cm^{-2})> 13.2$ show an increase (at the 2.2$\sigma$ and 1.4$\sigma$ levels, respectively) from redshift $z\approx5$ to 3, while absorption systems with log$(N_{\rm CIV}/\rm cm^{-2})= 12.3-13.2$ exhibit a constant $dn/dX$ and $\Omega_{\rm CIV}$.         |

|| <mark>J. Liu</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-03-25*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            There has been growing evidence that mu and tau neutrinos are noticeably different due to the emergence of muons in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs). Recent theoretical studies also suggest that all flavors of neutrinos and antineutrinos inevitably experience some flavor mixing instabilities including fast neutrino flavor conversions (FFC), which corresponds to one of the collective neutrino oscillations powered by neutrino self-interactions. This represents a need for quantum kinetic treatment in the numerical modeling of neutrino dynamics, which is, however, a formidable computational challenge. In this paper, we present an approximate method to predict asymptotic states of FFC without solving a quantum kinetic equation under a three-flavor framework, in which mu and tau neutrino distributions are not necessarily identical to each other. The approximate method is developed based on a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) relaxation time prescription, capable of capturing essential features of mixing competitions among three different flavor-coherent states. Our proposed scheme is computationally inexpensive and easy to implement in any classical neutrino transport scheme.         |
