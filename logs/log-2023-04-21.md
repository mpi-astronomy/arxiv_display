|**Abstract**| Studies of rest-frame optical emission in quasars at $z>6$ have historically been limited by the wavelengths accessible by ground-based telescopes. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now offers the opportunity to probe this emission deep into the reionization epoch. We report the observations of eight quasars at $z>6.5$ using the JWST/NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy, as a part of the ''A SPectroscopic survey of biased halos In the Reionization Era (ASPIRE)" program. Our JWST spectra cover the quasars' emission between rest frame $\sim$ 4100 and 5100 \r{A}. The profiles of these quasars' broad H$\beta$ emission lines span a FWHM from 3000 to 6000 $\rm{km~s^{-1}}$. The H$\beta$-based virial black hole (BH) masses, ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 billion solar masses, are generally consistent with their MgII-based BH masses. The new measurements based on the more reliable H$\beta$ tracer thus confirm the existence of billion solar-mass BHs in the reionization epoch. In the observed [OIII] $\lambda\lambda$4960,5008 doublets of these luminous quasars, broad components are more common than narrow core components ($\le~1200~\rm{km~s^{-1}}$), and only one quasar shows stronger narrow components than broad. Two quasars exhibit significantly broad and blueshifted [OIII] emission, thought to trace galactic-scale outflows, with median velocities of $-610~\rm{km~s^{-1}}$ and $-1430~\rm{km~s^{-1}}$ relative to the [CII] $158\,\mu$m line. All eight quasars show strong optical FeII emission, and follow the Eigenvector 1 relations defined by low-redshift quasars. The entire ASPIRE program will eventually cover 25 quasars and provide a statistical sample for the studies of the BHs and quasar spectral properties. |

|**Abstract**| We present the first results from the JWST ASPIRE program (A SPectroscopic survey of biased halos In the Reionization Era). This program represents an imaging and spectroscopic survey of 25 reionization-era quasars and their environments by utilizing the unprecedented capabilities of NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) mode. ASPIRE will deliver the largest ($\sim280~{\rm arcmin}^2$) galaxy redshift survey at 3-4 $\mu$m among JWST Cycle-1 programs and provide extensive legacy values for studying the formation of the earliest supermassive black holes (SMBHs), the assembly of galaxies, early metal enrichment, and cosmic reionization. In this first ASPIRE paper, we report the discovery of a filamentary structure traced by the luminous quasar J0305-3150 and ten [OIII] emitters at $z=6.6$. This structure has a 3D galaxy overdensity of $\delta_{\rm gal}=12.6$ over 637 cMpc$^3$, one of the most overdense structures known in the early universe, and could eventually evolve into a massive galaxy cluster. Together with existing VLT/MUSE and ALMA observations of this field, our JWST observations reveal that J0305-3150 traces a complex environment where both UV-bright and dusty galaxies are present, and indicate that the early evolution of galaxies around the quasar is not simultaneous. In addition, we discovered 31 [OIII] emitters in this field at other redshifts, $5.3<z<6.7$, with half of them situated at $z\sim5.4$ and $z\sim6.2$. This indicates that star-forming galaxies, such as [OIII] emitters, are generally clustered at high redshifts. These discoveries demonstrate the unparalleled redshift survey capabilities of NIRCam WFSS and the potential of the full ASPIRE survey dataset. |
