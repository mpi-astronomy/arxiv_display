|**Abstract**| We report the discovery of Cerberus, an extremely red object detected with the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) observations in the F1000W filter of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. The object is detected at S/N~6, with F1000W~27 mag, and it is extremely faint in both the NIRCam data gathered by the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, JADES, with ~30.5 mag $5\sigma$ upper limits in individual bands, as well as in the MIDIS F560W ultra deep data ($\sim$29 mag, $5\sigma$). Analyzing the spectral energy distribution built with individual (low S/N) optical-to-mid-infrared filters and (S/N~5) stacks, we discuss the possible nature of this red NIRCam-dark source using a battery of codes. We discard the possibility of Cerberus being a Solar System body based on the $<$0.016" proper motion in the 1-year apart JADES and MIDIS observations. A sub-stellar Galactic nature is deemed unlikely, given that the Cerberus' relatively flat NIRCam-to-NIRCam and very red NIRCam-to-MIRI flux ratios are not consistent with any brown dwarf model. The extragalactic nature of Cerberus offers 3 possibilities: (1) A $z\sim0.4$ galaxy with strong emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; the very low inferred stellar mass, $\mathrm{M}_\star=10^{5-6}$ M$_\odot$, makes this possibility highly improbable. (2) A dusty galaxy at $z\sim4$ with an inferred stellar mass $\mathrm{M}_\star\sim10^{8}$ M$_\odot$. (3) A galaxy with observational properties similar to those of the reddest little red dots discovered around $z\sim7$, but Cerberus lying at $z\sim15$, presenting a spectral energy distribution in the rest-frame optical dominated by emission from a dusty torus or a dusty starburst. |

|**Abstract**| Using the medium resolution spectrograph X-shooter, spectra of 235 OB and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in sub-solar metallicity environments have been secured. [...]This second paper focuses on the optical observations of 232 Magellanic Clouds targets. It describes the uniform reduction of the UVB (300 - 560 nm) and VIS (550 - 1020 nm) XShootU data as well as the preparation of advanced data products [...] . The data reduction of the raw data is based on the ESO CPL X-shooter pipeline. We paid particular attention to the determination of the response curves [...] We implemented slit-loss correction, absolute flux calibration, (semi-)automatic rectification to the continuum, and a correction for telluric lines. The spectra of individual epochs were corrected for the barycentric motion, re-sampled and co-added, and the spectra from the two arms were merged into a single flux calibrated spectrum covering the entire optical range with maximum signal-to-noise ratio. [...] We provide three types of data products: (i) two-dimensional spectra for each UVB and VIS exposure; (ii) one-dimensional UVB and VIS spectra before and after response-correction, as well as after applying various processing, including absolute flux calibration, telluric removal, normalisation and barycentric correction; and (iii) co-added flux-calibrated and rectified spectra over the full optical range, for which all available XShootU exposures were combined. For many of the targets, the final signal-to-noise ratio per resolution element is above 200 in both the UVB and the VIS co-added spectra. The reduced data and advanced scientific data products will be made available to the community upon publication of this paper. [...] |

|**Abstract**| We report the discovery and characterization of three giant exoplanets orbiting solar-analog stars, detected by the \tess space mission and confirmed through ground-based photometry and radial velocity (RV) measurements taken at La Silla observatory with \textit{FEROS}. TOI-2373\,b is a warm Jupiter orbiting its host star every $\sim$ 13.3 days, and is one of the two most massive known exoplanet with a precisely determined mass and radius around a star similar to the Sun, with an estimated mass of m$_p$ = $9.3^{+0.2}_{-0.2}\,M_{\mathrm{jup}}$, and a radius of $r_p$ = $0.93^{+0.2}_{-0.2}\,R_{\mathrm{jup}}$. With a mean density of $\rho = 14.4^{+0.9}_{-1.0}\,\mathrm{g\,cm}^{-3}$, TOI-2373\,b is among the densest planets discovered so far. TOI-2416\,b orbits its host star on a moderately eccentric orbit with a period of $\sim$ 8.3 days and an eccentricity of $e$ = $0.32^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$. TOI-2416\,b is more massive than Jupiter with $m_p$ = 3.0$^{+0.10}_{-0.09}\,M_{\mathrm{jup}}$, however is significantly smaller with a radius of $r_p$ = $0.88^{+0.02}_{-0.02},R_{\mathrm{jup}}$, leading to a high mean density of $\rho = 5.4^{+0.3}_{-0.3}\,\mathrm{g\,cm}^{-3}$. TOI-2524\,b is a warm Jupiter near the hot Jupiter transition region, orbiting its star every $\sim$ 7.2 days on a circular orbit. It is less massive than Jupiter with a mass of $m_p$ = $0.64^{+0.04}_{-0.04}\,M_{\mathrm{jup}}$, and is consistent with an inflated radius of $r_p$ = $1.00^{+0.02}_{-0.03}\,R_{\mathrm{jup}}$, leading to a low mean density of $\rho = 0.79^{+0.08}_{-0.08}\,\mathrm{g\,cm}^{-3}$. The newly discovered exoplanets TOI-2373\,b, TOI-2416\,b, and TOI-2524\,b have estimated equilibrium temperatures of $860^{+10}_{-10}$ K, $1080^{+10}_{-10}$ K, and $1100^{+20}_{-20}$ K, respectively, placing them in the sparsely populated transition zone between hot and warm Jupiters. |
