|**Abstract**|            We present four newly validated transiting brown dwarfs identified through TESS photometry and confirmed with high-precision radial velocity measurements obtained from the FEROS and PLATOSpec spectrographs. Notably, three of these companions exhibit orbital periods exceeding 100 days, thereby expanding the sample of long-period transiting brown dwarfs from two to five systems. The host stars of long-period brown dwarfs show mild subsolar metallicity. These discoveries highlight the expansion of the metal-poor, long-period distribution and help us better understand the brown dwarf desert. In our comparative analysis of eccentricity and metallicity demographics, we utilize catalogues of long-period giant planets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stellar companions. After accounting for tidal influences, the eccentricity distribution aligns with that of low-mass stellar binaries, presenting a different profile than that observed within the giant planet population. Additionally, the metallicity of the host stars reveals a noteworthy trend: short-period transiting brown dwarfs are predominantly associated with metal-rich stars, whereas long-period brown dwarfs are more often found around metal-poor stars, demonstrating statistical similarities to low-mass stellar hosts. This trend has also been previously observed in studies of hot and cold Jupiters and points to a period-coded mixture of channels. A natural explanation is that most brown dwarfs originate from fragmentation at wider separations, with long-period systems retaining this stellar-like imprint, while only those embedded in massive, long-lived, metal-rich protoplanetary discs are efficiently delivered and stabilised to short orbits.         |

|**Abstract**|            Circumstellar discs, and especially their inner regions, covering ranges from <1 au to a few astronomical units, are the birthplaces of terrestrial planets. The inner regions are thought to be similarly diverse in structure as the well-observed outer regions probed by ALMA. Combining data and results from previous studies of the VLTI/PIONIER and VLTI/GRAVITY instruments with new, multi-epoch VLTI/MATISSE observations, we aim to provide a comprehensive picture of the structure of the inner regions of the circumstellar disc around the F-type Herbig Ae/Be star HD 142527 A, the primary of a binary star system. We model the multi-wavelength interferometric data using a parametrised, geometrically thin disc model, allowing for azimuthal asymmetry, exploring a first-order disc modulation and an off-centre Gaussian component. We find time-variable structures in the N-band observables, which we reproduce with time-dependent models. This variability manifests as azimuthally asymmetric emission, evidenced by strong, non-zero closure phases in the N-band data. Fits to individual epochs of the N-band observations yield better $\chi^2_\text{r}$ values than fits to all epochs simultaneously. This suggests substantial changes in the geometry of the inner disc emission from ~1 au up to a few astronomical-unit scales from one year to the next. Moreover, our models produce a very close-in inner disc rim $R_\text{rim}\approx0.1$ au. All together, we find a very complex, substantially non-point symmetric and temporally-variable disc ($r_\text{out}\lesssim6$ au) around the primary. The very close-in inner rim indicates the presence of material inside the typical wall-like sublimation radius $R_\text{rim,literature}\approx0.3$ au. The complex, temporally variable inner-disc geometry is likely affected or even caused by the close passing (~5 au) and short orbit ($P\approx24$ yr) of the companion HD 142527 B.         |

|**Abstract**|            The distinct formation pathways of directly-imaged exoplanets and isolated brown dwarfs might leave imprints in the inherited elemental and isotopic abundances, but such measurements require careful characterisation of the atmospheres. In particular, L-T transition objects exhibit signs of dynamics that drive their atmospheres out of chemical equilibrium. In this work, we studied the nearest L-T brown dwarfs, Luhman 16A and B, to assess the chemical dis-equilibrium in their atmospheres and to investigate their elemental and isotopic composition. As part of the ESO SupJup Survey, we obtained high-resolution CRIRES$^+$ K-band spectra of the binary, which were analysed using an atmospheric retrieval framework. We detect and retrieve the abundances of $^{12}$CO, H$_2$O, CH$_4$, NH$_3$, H$_2$S, HF, and the $^{13}$CO isotopologue. Both atmospheres are in chemical dis-equilibrium with somewhat stronger vertical mixing in Luhman 16A compared to B ($K_\mathrm{zz,A}\sim10^{8.7}$, $K_\mathrm{zz,B}\sim10^{8.2}\ \mathrm{cm^2\ s^{-1}}$). The tested chemical models, free- and dis-equilibrium chemistry, yield consistent mixing ratios and agree with earlier work at shorter wavelengths. The gaseous C/O ratios show evidence of oxygen trapping in silicate-oxide clouds. While the C/O ratios are consistent with solar, the metallicities are modestly enhanced with $\mathrm{[C/H]}\sim0.15$. The carbon isotope ratios are measured at $\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C_A}=74^{+2}_{-2}$ and $\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C_B}=74^{+3}_{-3}$. The coincident constraints of metallicities and isotopes across the binary reinforce their likely shared formation. The $\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C}$ ratios are aligned with the present-day interstellar medium, but lower than the solar-system value. This suggests a recent inheritance and corroborates the relatively young age ($\sim500$ Myr) of Luhman 16AB as members of the Oceanus moving group.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Euclid spacecraft, located at the second Lagrangian point of the Sun-Earth system, hosts the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) instrument. NISP is equipped with a mosaic of 16 HgCdTe-based detectors to acquire near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic data. To meet the spacecraft's constraints on computational resources and telemetry bandwidth, the near-infrared signal is processed onboard via a dedicated hardware-software architecture designed to fulfil the stringent Euclid's data-quality requirements. A custom application software, running on the two NISP data processing units, implements the NISP signal estimator: an ad-hoc algorithm which delivers accurate flux measurements and simultaneously estimates the quality of signal estimation through the quality factor parameter. This paper investigates the properties of the NISP signal estimator by evaluating its performance during the early flight operations of the NISP instrument. First, we revisit the assumptions on which the inference of the near-infrared signal is based and investigate the origin of the main systematics of the signal estimator through Monte Carlo simulations. Then, we test the flight performance of the NISP signal estimator. Results indicate a systematic bias lower than 0.01 e/s for 99% of the NISP pixel array, well within the noise budget of the estimated signal. We also derive an analytical expression for the variance of the NISP signal estimator, demonstrating its validity, particularly when the covariance matrix is not pre-computed. Finally, we provide a robust statistical framework to interpret the QF parameter, analyse its dependence on the signal estimator bias, and show its sensitivity to cosmic ray hits on NISP detectors. Our findings corroborate previous results on the NISP signal estimator and suggest a leading-order correction based on the agreement between flight data and simulations.         |

|**Abstract**|            General Relativity (GR) faces challenges from cosmic acceleration and observational tensions, necessitating stringent tests at cosmological scales. In this work, we probe GR deviations via a $\mu$-$\Sigma$ modified gravity parameterization, integrating KiDS-Legacy weak lensing (1347 deg$^2$, $z\leq 2.0$), joint CMB data (Planck/ACT/SPT), DESI DR2 BAO, and DES-Dovekie supernovae. KiDS-Legacy significantly improves constraint precision: $\mu_0$ (matter clustering) by $\sim 43\%$ and $\Sigma_0$ (gravitational light deflection) by $\sim 60\%$ relative to CMB alone. In the $\Lambda$CDM background, $\mu_0 = 0.21\pm 0.21$ is consistent with GR, while $\Sigma_0 = 0.149\pm 0.051$ deviates from GR at the 3.0$\sigma$ level -- attributed to large-scale CMB lensing from ACT/SPT. This precise separation of GR-consistent matter clustering and deviant light deflection provides key observational clues for new physics or data systematics. Our work underscores the critical role of synergizing high-precision CMB and WL data in advancing GR tests.         |

|**Abstract**|            The dynamics of the inner regions of young stellar objects (YSOs) is driven by a variety of physical phenomena, from magnetospheres and accretion to the dust sublimation rim and inner disk flows. These inner environments evolve on timescales of hours to days, exactly when bursts, dips, and rapid structural changes carry the most valuable information about star and planet formations, but remain hardly reachable with current facilities. A better reactive infrastructure with six or more telescopes, combined with alerts from large time-domain surveys (e.g., at the era of LSST/Rubin type facilities), and equipped with instruments spanning from the V-band to the thermal infrared (N), would provide the instantaneous uv-coverage and spectral diagnostics needed to unambiguously interpret and image these events as they happen. Such a world's first time-domain interferometric observatory would enable qualitatively new science: directly linking optical and infrared variability to spatially resolved changes in magnetospheric accretion, inner-disk geometry, and dust and gas dynamics in the innermost astronomical unit. Crucially, connecting these processes to outer-scale unresolved information from JWST, ALMA, and the ELT would yield a complete tomography of the planet-forming region.         |
