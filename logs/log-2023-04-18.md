|**Abstract**| The Gaia-ESO Survey is a public spectroscopic survey that has targeted $\gtrsim10^5$ stars covering all major components of the Milky Way from the end of 2011 to 2018, delivering its public final release in May 2022. Unlike other spectroscopic surveys, Gaia-ESO is the only survey that observed stars across all spectral types with dedicated, specialised analyses: from O ($T_\mathrm{eff} \sim 30,000-52,000$~K) all the way to K-M ($\gtrsim$3,500~K). The physics throughout these stellar regimes varies significantly, which has previously prohibited any detailed comparisons between stars of significantly different type. In the final data release (internal data release 6) of the Gaia-ESO Survey, we provide the final database containing a large number of products such as radial velocities, stellar parameters and elemental abundances, rotational velocity, and also, e.g., activity and accretion indicators in young stars and membership probability in star clusters for more than 114,000 stars. The spectral analysis is coordinated by a number of Working Groups (WGs) within the Survey, which specialise in the various stellar samples. Common targets are analysed across WGs to allow for comparisons (and calibrations) amongst instrumental setups and spectral types. Here we describe the procedures employed to ensure all Survey results are placed on a common scale to arrive at a single set of recommended results for all Survey collaborators to use. We also present some general quality and consistency checks performed over all Survey results. |

|**Abstract**| We present multi-epoch spectroscopic follow-up of a sample of ellipsoidal variables selected from Gaia DR3 as candidates for hosting quiescent black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs). Our targets were identified as BH/NS candidates because their optical light curves -- when interpreted with models that attribute variability to tidal distortion of a star by a companion that contributes negligible light -- suggest that the companions are compact objects. From the likely BH/NS candidates identified in recent work accompanying Gaia DR3, we select 14 of the most promising targets for follow-up. We obtained spectra for each object at 2-10 epochs, strategically observing near conjunction to best-constrain the radial velocity semi-amplitude. From the measured semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves, we derive minimum companion masses of $M_{2,\min} \leq 0.5 ~ M_{\odot}$ in all cases. Assuming random inclinations, the typical inferred companion mass is $M_2 \sim 0.15 ~ M_{\odot}$. This makes it unlikely that any of these systems contain a BH or NS, and we consider alternative explanations for the observed variability. We can best reproduce the observed light curves and radial velocities with models for unequal-mass contact binaries with starspots. Some of the objects in our sample may also be detached main-sequence binaries, or even single stars with pulsations or starspot variability masquerading as ellipsoidal variation. We provide recommendations for future spectroscopic efforts to further characterize this sample and more generally to search for compact object companions in close binaries. |

|**Abstract**| The energy injected from dark matter annihilation and decay processes potentially raises the ionisation of the intergalactic medium and leaves visible footprints on the anisotropy maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Galactic foregrounds emission in the microwave bands contaminate the CMB measurement and may affect the search for dark matter's signature. In this paper, we construct a full CMB data and foreground simulation based on the design of the next-generation ground-based CMB experiments. The foreground residual after the components separation on maps is fully considered in our data analysis, accounting for various contamination from the emission of synchrotron, thermal dust, free-free and spinning dust. We analyse the corresponding sensitivity on dark matter parameters from the temperature and polarization maps, and we find that the CMB foregrounds leave a non-zero yet controllable impact on the sensitivity. Comparing with statistics-only analysis, the CMB foreground residual leads to a factor of 7%-23% weakening on energy-injection constraints, depending on the specific dark matter process and experimental configuration. Strong limits on dark matter annihilation rate and decay lifetime can be expected after foreground subtraction. |
