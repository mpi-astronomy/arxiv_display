|**Abstract**| The ALMA Survey of Star Formation and Evolution in Massive Protoclusters with Blue Profiles (ASSEMBLE) aims to investigate the process of mass assembly and its connection to high-mass star formation theories in protoclusters in a dynamic view. We observed 11 massive (Mclump>1000 Msun), luminous (Lbol>10,000 Lsun), and blue-profile (infall signature) clumps by ALMA with resolution of 2200-5500 au at 350 GHz (870 um) in continuum and line emission. 248 dense cores were identified, including 106 cores showing protostellar signatures and 142 prestellar core candidates. Compared to early-stage infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) by ASHES, the core mass and surface density within the ASSEMBLE clumps exhibited significant increment, suggesting concurrent core accretion during the evolution of the clumps. The maximum mass of prestellar cores was found to be 2 times larger than that in IRDCs, indicating evolved protoclusters have the potential to harbor massive prestellar cores. The mass relation between clumps and their most massive core (MMCs) is observed in ASSEMBLE but not in IRDCs, which is suggested to be regulated by multiscale mass accretion. The mass correlation between the core clusters and their MMCs has a steeper slope compared to that observed in stellar clusters, which can be due to fragmentation of the MMC and stellar multiplicity. We observe a decrease in core separation and an increase in central concentration as protoclusters evolve. We confirm primordial mass segregation in the ASSEMBLE protoclusters, possibly resulting from gravitational concentration and/or gas accretion. |

|**Abstract**| We present the spectroscopic confirmation and precise mass measurement of the warm giant planet TOI-199 b. This planet was first identified in TESS photometry and confirmed using ground-based photometry from ASTEP in Antarctica including a full 6.5$\,$h long transit, PEST, Hazelwood, and LCO; space photometry from NEOSSat; and radial velocities (RVs) from FEROS, HARPS, CORALIE, and CHIRON. Orbiting a late G-type star, TOI-199\,b has a $\mathrm{104.854_{-0.002}^{+0.001} \, d}$ period, a mass of $\mathrm{0.17\pm0.02 \, M_J}$, and a radius of $\mathrm{0.810\pm0.005 \, R_J}$. It is the first warm exo-Saturn with a precisely determined mass and radius. The TESS and ASTEP transits show strong transit timing variations, pointing to the existence of a second planet in the system. The joint analysis of the RVs and TTVs provides a unique solution for the non-transiting companion TOI-199 c, which has a period of $\mathrm{273.69_{-0.22}^{+0.26} \, d}$ and an estimated mass of $\mathrm{0.28_{-0.01}^{+0.02} \, M_J}$. This period places it within the conservative Habitable Zone. |

|**Abstract**| In the third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detector era, the multi-messenger GW observation for binary neutron star (BNS) merger events can exert great impacts on exploring the cosmic expansion history. In this work, we comprehensively explore the potential of 3G GW standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimations by considering the 3G GW detectors and the future short $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) detector THESEUS-like telescope joint observations. Based on the 10-year observation of different detection strategies, we predict that the numbers of detectable GW-GRB events are 277-685 with the redshifts $z<4$ and the inclination angles $\iota<17^{\circ}$. For the cosmological analysis, we consider five typical dark energy models, i.e., the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM models, and interacting dark energy (IDE) models (I$\Lambda$CDM and I$w$CDM). We find that GW can tightly constrain the Hubble constant with precisions of $0.09\%$-$0.37\%$, but perform not well in constraining other cosmological parameters. Fortunately, GW could effectively break the cosmological parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB+BAO+SN (CBS). When combining the mock GW data with the CBS data, CBS+GW can tightly constrain the equation of state parameter of dark energy $w$ with a precision of $1.36\%$, close to the standard of precision cosmology. Meanwhile, the addition of GW to CBS could improve constraints on cosmological parameters by $35.3\%$-$92.0\%$. In conclusion, GW standard siren observations from 3G GW detectors could play a crucial role in helping solve the Hubble tension and probe the fundamental nature of dark energy. |
