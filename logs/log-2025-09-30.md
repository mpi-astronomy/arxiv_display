|**Abstract**|            We present measurements of the masses associated with $\sim18,000$ HII regions across 19 nearby star-forming galaxies by combining data from JWST, HST, MUSE, ALMA, VLA, and MeerKAT from the multi-wavelength PHANGS survey. We report 10 pc-scale measurements of the mass of young stars, ionized gas, and older disk stars coincident with each HII region, as well as the initial and current mass of molecular gas, atomic gas, and swept-up shell material, estimated from lower resolution data. We find that the mass of older stars dominates over young stars at $\gtrsim10\rm\,pc$ scales, and ionized gas exceeds the stellar mass in most optically bright HII regions. Combining our mass measurements for a statistically large sample of HII regions, we derive 10 pc scale star-formation efficiencies $\approx6{-}17\%$ for individual HII regions. Comparing each region's self-gravity with the ambient ISM pressure and total pressure from pre-supernova stellar feedback, we show that most optically bright HII regions are over-pressured relative to their own self-gravity and the ambient ISM pressure, and that they are hence likely expanding into their surroundings. Larger HII regions in galaxy centers approach dynamical equilibrium. The self-gravity of regions is expected to dominate over pre-supernova stellar feedback pressure at $\gtrsim130\rm\,pc$ and $60\rm\,pc$ scales in galaxy disks and centers, respectively, but is always sub-dominant to the ambient ISM pressure on HII region scales. Our measurements have direct implications for the dynamical evolution of star-forming regions and the efficiency of stellar feedback in ionizing and clearing cold gas.         |

|**Abstract**|            Singly-ionized carbon is theorized to be the brightest emission line feature in star-forming galaxies, and hence an excellent tracer of the evolution of cosmic star formation. Archival maps from far-infrared and sub-millimeter surveys potentially contain the redshifted [CII]-158$\mu$m, hidden in the much brighter continuum emission. We present a search for aggregate [CII]-158$\mu$m line emission across the predicted peak of star formation history by tomographically stacking a high-completeness galaxy catalog on broadband deep maps of the COSMOS field and constraining residual excess emission after subtracting the continuum spectral energy distribution (SED). We obtain constraints on the sky-averaged [CII]-158$\mu$m signal from the three Herschel/SPIRE maps: $11.8\pm10.2$, $11.0\pm8.7$, $9.6\pm9.8$, and $9.2\pm6.6$ $k$Jy/sr at redshifts $z\sim 0.65$, $\sim1.3$, $\sim2.1$, and $\sim2.6$ respectively, corresponding to $1-1.4\sigma$ significance in each bin. Our $3\sigma$ upper limits are in tension with past $z\sim2.6$ results from cross-correlating SDSS-BOSS quasars with high-frequency Planck maps, and indicate a much less dramatic evolution ($\sim\times7.5$) of mean [CII] intensity across the peak of star formation history than collisional excitation models or frameworks calibrated to the tentative PlanckxBOSS measurement. We discuss this tension, particularly in the context of in-development surveys (TIM, EXCLAIM) that will map this [CII] at high redshift resolution. Having demonstrated stacking in broadband deep surveys as a complementary methodology to next-generation spectrometers for line intensity mapping, our novel methods can be extended to upcoming galaxy surveys such as Euclid, as well as to place upper limits on fainter atomic and molecular lines.         |

|**Abstract**|            Understanding the origin and evolution of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars is key to tracing the Galaxy's early chemical enrichment. We investigate how realistic 3D radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) model atmospheres affect carbon abundances in CEMP stars and implications for their classification and Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). We focus on biases from traditional 1D hydrostatic models. We use the M3DIS code to compute 3D RHD model atmospheres for main-sequence and sub-giant stars over a wide range of metallicities and carbon enhancements. Synthetic spectra of the CH G-band are calculated with 3D radiative transfer and compared to spectra from classical 1D MARCS models. We derive abundance corrections and apply them to a large SAGA database sample to quantify effects on the carbon abundance distribution and CEMP classification. Our new 3D CEMP models predict cooler upper atmospheric layers than in 1D models, resulting in stronger CH absorption and lower inferred carbon abundances by up to -0.9 dex at the lowest metallicities. Carbon enhancement in the atmosphere itself increases molecular opacities and leads to radiative re-heating, partly offsetting adiabatic cooling in 3D models and reducing 3D-1D abundance corrections. Applying these corrections lowers the CEMP fraction by up to 20% below [Fe/H]=-3 and alters the relative contribution of CEMP sub-classes. The fraction of CEMP-no stars increases while the number of CEMP-r/s stars decreases, due to the downward revision of absolute carbon abundances. These changes bring the Galactic carbon distribution into better agreement with GCE models assuming a 20% contribution from faint supernovae. Realistic model atmospheres are essential to reliably reconstruct the Galaxy's early chemical enrichment history.         |

|**Abstract**|            During the evolution of protoplanetary disks, dust grains start to grow, form larger particles, settle to the midplane, and rearrange the disk, mainly by the inward radial drift. Because of this, dust pebbles with an irregular shape usually align mechanically and thus cause polarization signatures in their thermal radiation due to dichroic emission or absorption. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the potential to trace the impact of mechanical grain alignment in protoplanetary disks on the observed degree and orientation of linear polarization at millimeter wavelengths. We combined 3D radiation hydrodynamical simulations to determine the density distribution and the velocity field of gas and dust particles, Monte Carlo dust-gas interaction simulations to calculate the mechanical alignment of dust in a gas flow, and, finally, 3D Monte Carlo polarized radiative transfer simulations to obtain synthetic polarimetric observations. We find that large grains, which contribute the most to the net polarization, are potentially mechanically aligned in the protoplanetary disk under the effect of the vertical shear instability (VSI). Thereby, the drift velocity is parallel to the rotational disk axis. Assuming oblate dust grains that are aligned with their short axis parallel to the direction of the drift velocity, the resulting polarization is usually along the major axis of the disk. This is in contrast to typical drift models that propose either a radial or azimuthal drift velocity component. If hydrodynamical instabilities, such as the VSI, dominate the kinematics in protoplanetary disks, the mechanical alignment of dust is a promising mechanism for grain alignment in these systems. In that case, the resulting millimeter polarization allows us to trace the orientation of aligned millimeter-sized grains.         |

|**Abstract**|            Cross-correlating neutral hydrogen (HI) 21cm intensity mapping with galaxy surveys provides an effective probe of astrophysical and cosmological information. This work presents a cross-correlation analysis between MeerKAT single-dish HI intensity mapping and Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) spectroscopic galaxy surveys in $z=0.4\sim1.2$, which will share a survey area of several thousand square degrees. Utilizing Jiutian-1G cosmological simulation, we simulate the observational data of MeerKAT and CSST with survey areas from $\sim1600$ to $600$ deg$^2$ at $z=0.5$, 0.7, and 1. The effects of beam pattern, polarization leakage, and different foregrounds in the MeerKAT HI intensity mapping are considered in the simulation. After employing foreground removal with the principal component analysis (PCA) method and performing signal compensation, we derive the cross-power spectra of MeerKAT and CSST. We perform the joint constraint using the CSST galaxy auto-power spectra and MeerKAT-CSST cross-power spectra with the least-squares fitting method. The constraint results show that, in the simulated survey area, the relative accuracy can achieve $6\%\sim 8\%$ for the parameter products $\Omega_{\rm HI}b_{\rm HI}b_{g}r_{\rm HI,g}$ and $\Omega_{\rm HI}b_{\rm HI}r_{\rm HI,g}$ at the three redshifts, which is $3\sim4$ times smaller than the current result. These findings indicate that the full MeerKAT-CSST joint observation with thousands of square degrees overlapping survey area can be a powerful probe of cosmic         |

|| W. Zhang, et al. -- incl., <mark>Y. Wang</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            End-to-end deep learning models fed with multi-band galaxy images are powerful data-driven tools used to estimate galaxy physical properties in the absence of spectroscopy. However, due to a lack of interpretability and the associational nature of such models, it is difficult to understand how the information additional to integrated photometry (e.g., morphology) contributes to the estimation task. Improving our understanding in this field would enable further advances into unraveling the physical connections among galaxy properties and optimizing data exploitation. Therefore, our work is aimed at interpreting the deep learning-based estimation of stellar mass via two interpretability techniques: causal analysis and mutual information decomposition. The former reveals the causal paths between multiple variables beyond nondirectional statistical associations, while the latter quantifies the multicomponent contributions (i.e., redundant, unique, and synergistic) of different input data to the stellar mass estimation. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we obtained meaningful results that provide physical interpretations for image-based models. Our work demonstrates the gains from combining deep learning with interpretability techniques, and holds promise in promoting more data-driven astrophysical research (e.g., astrophysical parameter estimations and investigations on complex multivariate physical processes).         |

|**Abstract**|            The CCAT Observatory's Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST) is designed to observe submillimeter astronomical signals with high precision, using receivers fielding state-of-the-art kinetic inductance detector (KID) arrays. Mod-Cam, a first-light instrument for FYST, serves as a testbed for instrument module characterization, including detailed evaluation of thermal behavior under operating conditions prior to deploying modules in the larger Prime-Cam instrument. Prime-Cam is a first generation multi-band, wide-field camera for FYST, designed to field up to seven instrument modules and provide unprecedented sensitivity across a broad frequency range. We present results from two key laboratory characterizations: an "optically open" cooldown to validate the overall thermal performance of the cryostat, and a "cold load" cooldown to measure the effect of focal plane temperature stability on detector noise. During the optically open test, we achieved stable base temperatures of 1.5 K on the 1 K stage and 85 mK at the detector stage. In the cold load configuration, we measured a detector focal plane RMS temperature stability of 3.2e-5 K. From this stability measurement, we demonstrate that the equivalent power from focal plane thermal fluctuations is only 0.0040% of a 5pW incident photon power for aluminum detectors and 0.0023% for titanium-nitride detectors, a negligible level for CCAT science goals. This highlights the success of the cryogenic system design and thermal management.         |

|**Abstract**|            The CCAT Observatory's first-light and commissioning instrument, Mod-Cam, is nearing readiness for deployment to the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST) in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. In-lab testing of Mod-Cam and the first CCAT instrument module, a 280 GHz broadband camera fielding over 10,000 kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs), is currently underway. CCAT's first-generation science instrument, Prime-Cam, will field approximately 100,000 KIDs across seven instrument modules. Like Mod-Cam, it employs 46 cm long low-thermal-conductivity flexible circuits ("stripline") between 4 K and 300 K to connect large arrays of multiplexed detectors in each instrument module to readout electronics. The 280 GHz camera currently installed in Mod-Cam uses six striplines to read out its over 10,000 detectors across 18 RF chains, each individual stripline containing six traces. In-lab testing thus far has allowed us to begin optimizing the attenuation in the readout chains for each of the three detector arrays in the 280 GHz module and demonstrate simultaneous readout of all networks using CCAT's RFSoC warm readout electronics. Here we present an overview of the Mod-Cam cold readout and discuss the stripline performance by investigating how its thermal conductivity impacts Mod-Cam and Prime-Cam cryogenic performance. We also report on stripline electrical transmission and crosstalk, identifying transition printed circuit boards (PCBs) as the dominant source of crosstalk. Using this result we outline design improvements to these PCBs that enhance isolation between readout networks.         |
