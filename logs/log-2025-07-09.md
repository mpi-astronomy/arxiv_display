|**Abstract**|            Determining the amount of sulfur in volatiles and refractories in the ISM remains one of the main problems in astrochemistry. The detection of H$_2$S ices, which are thought to be one of the main sulfur reservoirs, has not been achieved yet, and the only S-bearing species detected in the ices to date is OCS. PRODIGE large survey observations with NOEMA of several Class 0/I protostars in the Perseus Molecular Cloud provide a perfect opportunity to study the H$_2$S and OCS composition of the ices through the volatiles sublimated in the warm inner core (T$>$100K, n $\sim10^6$cm$^{-3}$) of these protostars. Our aim is to determine the H$_2$S/OCS ratio in the warm inner core of 24 protostars in order to study how it is affected by different factors during its evolution. We used the NOEMA millimeter observations from the PRODIGE program of H$_2$S, H$_2^{33}$S, OCS, OC$^{33}$S and OC$^{34}$S to estimate the H$_2$S and OCS column densities in the warm inner cores. We used SO and SO$_2$ data from the ALMA archive to give a rough estimate of the total sulfur abundance. We explore the chemistry of H$_2$S and OCS in the warm cores using chemical and dynamical simulations of the collapse of a dense core to form a protostar. The estimated H$_2$S/OCS ratio reveals a segregation of the sources into ``OCS-poor'' and ``OCS-rich'' protostars, where the OCS-poor protostars present higher H$_2$S/OCS ratios than the OCS-rich ones. Total sulfur abundance is always dominated by either H$_2$S or OCS, grows with evolution during the Class 0 phase up to $D_S<8$, and decreases again in the Class I. Simulations show that temperature changes in the pre-stellar phase and during the collapse can produce substantial differences in the H$_2$S and OCS abundances and in the H$_2$S/OCS ratio. Our analysis shows that the H$_2$S/OCS ratio is strongly influenced by the environment and the initial conditions of the cloud.         |

|**Abstract**|            In the current panorama of large surveys, the vast amount of data obtained with different methods, data types, formats, and stellar samples, is making an efficient use of the available information difficult. The Survey of Surveys is a project to critically compile survey results in a single catalogue, facilitating the scientific use of the available information. In this second release, we present two new catalogs of stellar parameters (Teff, logg, and [Fe/H]). To build the first catalog, SoS-Spectro, we calibrated internally and externally stellar parameters from five spectroscopic surveys (APOGEE, GALAH, Gaia-ESO, RAVE, and LAMOST) and externally on the PASTEL database. The second catalog, SoS-ML catalog, is obtained by using SoS-Spectro as a reference to train a multi-layer perceptron, which predicts stellar parameters based on two photometric surveys, SDSS and SkyMapper. As a novel approach, we build on previous parameters sets, from Gaia DR3 and Andrae et al. (2023), aiming to improve their precision and accuracy. We obtain a catalog of stellar parameters for around 23 millions of stars, which we make publicly available. We validate our results with several comparisons with other machine learning catalogs, stellar clusters, and astroseismic samples. We find substantial improvements in the parameters estimates compared to other Machine Learning methods in terms of precision and accuracy, especially in the metal-poor range, as shown in particular when validating our results with globular clusters. We believe that there are two reasons behind our improved results at the low-metallicity end: first, our use of a reference catalog, the SoS-Spectro, which is calibrated using high-resolution spectroscopic data; and second, our choice to build on pre-existing parameter estimates from em Gaia and Andrae et al., rather than attempting to obtain our predictions from survey data alone.         |

|**Abstract**|            HD 135344 AB is a young visual binary system that is best known for the protoplanetary disk around the secondary star. The circumstellar environment of the A0-type primary star, on the other hand, is already depleted. HD 135344 A is therefore an ideal target for the exploration of recently formed giant planets because it is not obscured by dust. We searched for and characterized substellar companions to HD 135344 A down to separations of about 10 au. We observed HD 135344 A with VLT/SPHERE in the $H23$ and $K12$ bands and obtained $YJ$ and $YJH$ spectroscopy. In addition, we carried out VLTI/GRAVITY observations for the further astrometric and spectroscopic confirmation of a detected companion. We discovered a close-in young giant planet, HD 135344 Ab, with a mass of about 10 $M_\mathrm{J}$. The multi-epoch astrometry confirms the bound nature based on common parallax and common proper motion. This firmly rules out the scenario of a non-stationary background star. The semi-major axis of the planetary orbit is approximately 15-20 au, and the photometry is consistent with that of a mid L-type object. The inferred atmospheric and bulk parameters further confirm the young and planetary nature of the companion. HD 135344 Ab is one of the youngest directly imaged planets that has fully formed and orbits on Solar System scales. It is a valuable target for studying the early evolution and atmosphere of a giant planet that could have formed in the vicinity of the snowline.         |

|**Abstract**|            In this study we use Integral Field Spectroscopic (IFS) observations for one of the closest galaxy to us, the grand design spiral IC 342, to derive physical properties of HII regions at sub-kpc scales. This IFS data represents, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive observational effort in the optical for this galaxy. The final IFS datacube consists of 349 individual pointings using the IFS instrumentation from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. Using a prototype of the data analysis pipeline that will be devoted to the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM) survey, we measure different observables from the emission line in the optical. In particular, using the flux map of the H$\alpha$ emission line, we derive the location and sizes of H ii region candidates for IC 342. Using the integrated flux for different emission lines within each region, we derived the radial distribution of different physical properties from the ionized gas (e.g., optical extinction, H$\alpha$ luminosity, oxygen abundance, etc). Comparing with larger samples of galaxies with IFS data, our results suggest that physical properties of the ionized gas of IC 342 are similar to galaxies with similar stellar mass in the nearby universe.         |

|**Abstract**|            We describe the drizzling pipeline and contents of the drizzled database for Hubble Space Telescope Cycle 27-29 Archival Legacy project "SKYSURF," the largest archival project ever approved for Hubble. SKYSURF aims to investigate the extragalactic background light (EBL) using all 143,914 ACSWFC, WFC3UVIS, and WFC3IR images that have been taken by Hubble since its launch in 2002. SKYSURF has produced 38,027 single-visit mosaics and 7,893 multi-visit mosaics across 28 ACSWFC, WFC3UVIS, and WFC3IR filters using non-standard drizzling methods, which include preserving the lowest sky-level of each visit/group in the drizzled products, applying wider apertures for cosmic ray rejection, correcting effects caused by charge transfer efficiency (CTE) degradation, and removing potential light gradients from input images via sky-map subtraction. We generate source catalogs for all drizzled products with Source Extractor and provide updated star-galaxy separation parameters and integrated galaxy light (IGL) estimates for 25 of the 28 SKYSURF filters (wavelength range 0.2-1.7 microns) using a novel IGL fitting method made possible by the vast SKYSURF dataset. We discuss the data processing and data analysis challenges encountered, detail our solutions, and offer suggestions that may facilitate future large-scale IGL investigations with Webb, SPHEREx, and Roman.         |
