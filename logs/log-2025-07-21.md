|**Abstract**|            Sub-Neptune exoplanets are the most abundant type of planet known today. As they do not have a Solar System counterpart, many open questions exist about their composition and formation. Previous spectroscopic studies rule out aerosol-free hydrogen-helium-dominated atmospheres for many characterized sub-Neptunes but are inconclusive about their exact atmospheric compositions. Here we characterize the hot (Teq=1311K) sub-Neptune HD 86226 c, which orbits its G-type host star. Its high equilibrium temperature prohibits methane-based haze formation, increasing the chances for a clear atmosphere on this planet. We use HST data taken with WFC3 and STIS from the Sub-neptune Planetary Atmosphere Characterization Experiment (SPACE) Program to perform near-infrared 1.1-1.7micrometer transmission spectroscopy and UV characterization of the host star. We report a featureless transmission spectrum that is consistent within 0.4 sigma with a constant transit depth of 418+-14ppm. The amplitude of this spectrum is only 0.01 scale heights for a H/He-dominated atmosphere, excluding a cloud-free solar-metallicity atmosphere on HD 86226 c with a confidence of 6.5 sigma. Based on an atmospheric retrieval analysis and forward models of cloud and haze formation, we find that the featureless spectrum could be due to a metal enrichment [M/H] above 2.3 (3 sigma confidence lower limit) of a cloudless atmosphere, or silicate (MgSiO3), iron (Fe), or manganese sulfide (MnS) clouds. For these species, we perform an investigation of cloud formation in high-metallicity, high-temperature atmospheres. Our results highlight that HD 86226c does not follow the aerosol trend of sub-Neptunes found by previous studies. Follow-up observations with the JWST could determine whether this planet aligns with the recent detections of metal-enriched atmospheres or if it harbors a cloud species otherwise atypical for sub-Neptunes.         |

|**Abstract**|            We investigate the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) MIRI MRS gas molecular content of an externally irradiated Herbig disk, the F-type XUE 10 source, in the context of the eXtreme UV Environments (XUE) program. XUE 10 belongs to the massive star cluster NGC 6357 (1.69 kpc), where it is exposed to an external far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation $\approx$ 10$^3$ times stronger than in the Solar neighborhood. We modeled the molecular features in the mid-infrared spectrum with Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) 0D slab models. We derived basic parameters of the stellar host from a VLT FORS2 optical spectrum using PHOENIX stellar templates. We detect bright CO2 gas with the first simultaneous detection (> 5$\sigma$) of four isotopologues (12CO2, 13CO2, 16O12C18O, 16O12C17O) in a protoplanetary disk. We also detect faint CO emission (2$\sigma$) and the HI Pf$\alpha$ line (8$\sigma$). We also place strict upper limits on the water content, finding a total column density $\lesssim$ 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. The CO2 species trace low gas temperatures (300-370 K) with a range of column densities of 7.4 $\times$ 10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ (16O12C17O)-1.3 $\times$ 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (12CO2) in an equivalent emitting radius of 1.15 au. The emission of 13CO2 is likely affected by line optical depth effects. 16O12C18O and 16O12C17O abundances may be isotopically anomalous compared to the 16O/18O and 16O/17O ratios measured in the interstellar medium and the Solar System. We propose that the mid-infrared spectrum of XUE 10 is explained by H2O removal either via advection or strong photo-dissociation by stellar UV irradiation, and enhanced local CO2 gas-phase production. Outer disk truncation supports the observed CO2-H2O dichotomy. A CO2 vapor enrichment in 18O and 17O can be explained by means of external UV irradiation and early on (10$^{4-5}$ yr) delivery of isotopically anomalous water ice to the inner disk.         |

|**Abstract**|            Many white dwarfs are observed in compact double white dwarf binaries and, through the emission of gravitational waves, a large fraction are destined to merge. The merger remnants that do not explode in a Type Ia supernova are expected to initially be rapidly rotating and highly magnetized. We here present our discovery of the variable white dwarf ZTF J200832.79+444939.67, hereafter ZTF J2008+4449, as a likely merger remnant showing signs of circumstellar material without a stellar or substellar companion. The nature of ZTF J2008+4449 as a merger remnant is supported by its physical properties: hot ($35,500\pm300$ K) and massive ($1.12\pm0.03$ M$_\odot$), the white dwarf is rapidly rotating with a period of $\approx$ 6.6 minutes and likely possesses exceptionally strong magnetic fields ($\sim$ 400-600 MG) at its surface. Remarkably, we detect a significant period derivative of $(1.80\pm0.09)\times10^{-12}$ s/s, indicating that the white dwarf is spinning down, and a soft X-ray emission that is inconsistent with photospheric emission. As the presence of a mass-transferring stellar or brown dwarf companion is excluded by infrared photometry, the detected spin down and X-ray emission could be tell-tale signs of a magnetically driven wind or of interaction with circumstellar material, possibly originating from the fallback of gravitationally bound merger ejecta or from the tidal disruption of a planetary object. We also detect Balmer emission, which requires the presence of ionized hydrogen in the vicinity of the white dwarf, showing Doppler shifts as high as $\approx$ 2000 km s$^{-1}$. The unusual variability of the Balmer emission on the spin period of the white dwarf is consistent with the trapping of a half ring of ionised gas in the magnetosphere of the white dwarf.         |

|**Abstract**|            The advent of JWST has revolutionized the study of faint satellite galaxies at $z \gtrsim 1$, enabling statistical constraints on galaxy evolution and the galaxy$-$halo connection in a previously unexplored mass and redshift regime. We compare satellite abundances at $1 < z < 3.5$ from recent JWST observations with predictions from cosmological dark matter-only zoom-in simulations. We identify and quantify several sources of biases that can impact theoretical satellite counts, finding that assumptions about subhalo tidal evolution introduce the largest uncertainty in predictions for the satellite mass function. Using a flexible galaxy disruption model, we explore a range of disruption scenarios, spanning hydrodynamically motivated and idealized prescriptions, to bracket plausible physical outcomes. We show that varying galaxy durability can change the predicted satellite mass functions by a factor of $\sim3.5$. The JWST data and our fiducial model are consistent within $1-2\sigma$ across the full redshift ($1 < z < 3.5$) and stellar mass ($M_\star> 10^7~\mathrm{M}_\odot$) range probed. We find evidence that subhalos are at least as long-lived as predicted by hydrodynamic simulations. Our framework will enable robust constraints on the tidal evolution of subhalos with future observations. This work presents the first direct comparison between cosmological models and observations of the high-redshift satellite population in this low-mass regime. These results showcase JWST's emerging power to test structure formation in the first half of the Universe in a new domain and to constrain the physical processes driving the evolution of low-mass galaxies across cosmic time.         |

|| T.-N. Li, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            One of the most fundamental relationships in modern cosmology is the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), which describes the relationship between the angular diameter distance ($D_{\rm A}$) and the luminosity distance ($D_{\rm L}$), and is expressed as: $\eta(z)=D_{\rm L}(z)(1+z)^{-2}/D_{\rm A}(z)=1$. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive test of the CDDR by combining baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the SDSS and DESI surveys with type Ia supernova (SN) data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We utilize an artificial neural network approach to match the SN and BAO data at the same redshift. To explore potential violations of the CDDR, we consider three different parameterizations: (i) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z$; (ii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z/(1+z)$; (iii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0\ln(1+z)$. Our results indicate that the calibration of the SN absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ plays a crucial role in testing potential deviations from the CDDR, as there exists a significant negative correlation between $\eta_0$ and $M_{\rm B}$. For PantheonPlus analysis, when $M_{\rm B}$ is treated as a free parameter, no evidence of CDDR violation is found. In contrast, fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm D20}$ prior with $-19.230\pm0.040$ mag leads to a deviation at approximately the $2\sigma$ level, while fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm B23}$ prior with $-19.396\pm0.016$ mag remains in agreement with the CDDR. Furthermore, overall analyses based on the SDSS+DESY5 and DESI+DESY5 data consistently show no evidence of the deviation from the CDDR.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Pierre Auger Observatory, located in La Pampa Amarilla, Argentina, has been continuously acquiring data since 2004. It comprises a surface detector array covering 3,000 km$^2$ and 27 fluorescence telescopes, designed to detect extensive air showers initiated by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. An upgrade to the Observatory was commissioned in 2024, enhancing the existing water-Cherenkov detectors with additional radio antennas, surface scintillator detectors, and a buried scintillator array. This compilation of contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference, held in Geneva, Switzerland (July 15-24, 2025), presents recent results from the Pierre Auger Collaboration, addressing a wide range of fundamental questions in astroparticle physics. The included papers cover measurements of the energy spectrum, mass composition, and arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, investigations of hadronic interactions in extensive air showers, and searches for ultra-high-energy photons and neutrinos. Additional topics include radio detection techniques, solar-related phenomena, and atmospheric events such as ELVES and TGFs. The list also contains first results and performance evaluations of the upgraded detectors, AugerPrime, along with reports on outreach and social engagement initiatives conducted by the Collaboration.         |
