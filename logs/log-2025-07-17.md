|**Abstract**|            The detection of planets in protoplanetary disks has proven to be extremely challenging. In contrast, rings and gaps, usually attributed to planet-disk interactions, have been found in virtually every large protoplanetary (Class II) disk observed at 0.9-1.3 mm with sufficient spatial resolution (5 au). The nearby disk around MP Mus (PDS 66) stands as an exception to this rule, and its advanced age (7-10 Myr) is particularly difficult to reconcile with its apparent lack of substructures. Despite the disk's smooth appearance, Gaia data of MP Mus show a significant proper motion anomaly, signalling the presence of a companion. Here we present ALMA 3 mm observations of the system with comparable high spatial resolution to previous 1.3 mm data. The new observations pierce deeper into the disk midplane and reveal an inner cavity (<3 au) and a ring at 10 au. The disk structure inferred from ALMA observations narrows down the properties of the companion to a gas giant orbiting at 1-3 au, and hydrodynamic simulations further confirm that such a planet can produce the observed cavity. These independent pieces of evidence constitute an indirect but compelling detection of an exoplanet within a protoplanetary disk using Gaia astrometry. MP Mus is the first system in which undetected substructures are revealed thanks to the lower optical depths at longer wavelengths, suggesting that rings and gaps are even more abundant than what is currently believed.         |

|**Abstract**|            The exoALMA program gave an unprecedented view of the complex kinematics of protoplanetary disks, revealing diverse structures that remain poorly understood. We show that moderate disk warps ($\sim 0.5-2^\circ$) can naturally explain many of the observed large-scale velocity features with azimuthal wavenumber $m = 1$. Using a simple model, we interpret line-of-sight velocity variations as changes in the projected Keplerian rotation caused by warping of the disk. While not a unique explanation, this interpretation aligns with growing observational evidence that warps are common. We demonstrate that such warps can also produce spiral structures in scattered light and CO brightness temperature, with $\sim 10$ K variations in MWC 758. Within the exoALMA sample, warp properties correlate with stellar accretion rates, suggesting a link between the inner disc and outer disc kinematics. If warps cause large-scale kinematic structure, this has far reaching implications for turbulence, angular momentum transport, and planet formation.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present two extensive sets of 3500+1000 simulations of dark matter haloes on the past light cone, and two corresponding sets of simulated (`mock') galaxy catalogues that represent the Euclid spectroscopic sample. The simulations were produced with the latest version of the PINOCCHIO code, and provide the largest, public set of simulated skies. Mock galaxy catalogues were obtained by populating haloes with galaxies using an halo occupation distribution (HOD) model extracted from the Flagship galaxy catalogue provided by Euclid Collaboration. The Geppetto set of 3500 simulated skies was obtained by tiling a 1.2 Gpc/h box to cover a light-cone whose sky footprint is a circle of 30 deg radius, for an area of 2763 deg$^2$ and a minimum halo mass of $1.5\times10^{11}$ Msun/h. The relatively small box size makes this set unfit for measuring very large scales. The EuclidLargeBox set consists of 1000 simulations of 3.38 Gpc/h, with the same mass resolution and a footprint that covers half of the sky, excluding the Milky Way zone of avoidance. From this we produced a set of 1000 EuclidLargeMocks on the 30 deg radius footprint, whose comoving volume is fully contained in the simulation box. We validated the two sets of catalogues by analysing number densities, power spectra, and 2-point correlation functions, showing that the Flagship spectroscopic catalogue is consistent with being one of the realisations of the simulated sets, although we noticed small deviations limited to the quadrupole at k>0.2 h/Mpc. We show cosmological parameter inference from these catalogues and demonstrate that using one realisation of EuclidLargeMocks in place of the Flagship mock produces the same posteriors, to within the expected shift given by sample variance. These simulated skies will be used for the galaxy clustering analysis of Euclid's Data Release 1 (DR1).         |

|**Abstract**|            The Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of high redshift quasars is a powerful probe of the late stages of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), particularly through the presence of Gunn-Peterson troughs. These troughs span a broad range of lengths (up to $\sim 100$ Mpc), suggesting large-scale coherent structures in the intergalactic medium. We aim to gain insight into the presence, extent, and magnitude of correlations in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest at $5<z<6.1$, and to quantify the scales over which correlations are significant to inform on the necessary volume for simulating the EoR. Using the extended XQR-30 dataset and accounting for the relevant systematics, we compute the flux correlation matrix and perform an MCMC analysis to quantify the extent and strength of the correlation. To interpret our results, we compare to $1.5^3,\mathrm{Gpc}^3$ lightcones of Lyman-$\alpha$ transmission fluxes from several reionization scenarios, including a fiducial box employing SCRIPT. We detect strong correlations at $z > 5.3$, extending at least tens of Mpc and strongly increasing with redshift. Our results suggest a redshift-dependent correlation length, from $L \leq 26.53\, (68.47)$ Mpc at 1-$\sigma$ (2-$\sigma$) limit at $z = 5.0$ to $L = 252.72^{+272.61}_{-41.61}$ Mpc at $z = 6.1$. In contrast, all simulation models predict shorter correlation lengths ($< 60$ Mpc) and a slower redshift evolution. The presence and redshift-dependence of correlations in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest on $>200$ Mpc scales at $z=6$ indicates that cosmological simulations should be larger than this scale to adequately sample the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Despite implementing a fluctuating UVB and numerous neutral islands at $z<6$, our fiducial SCRIPT-based simulation fails to reproduce the large-scale correlations. It may be that those ingredients are necessary, but not sufficient, to understanding the unfolding of the EoR.         |

|**Abstract**|            Cold brown dwarf atmospheres are good training grounds for analyzing temperate giant planets. WISEP J173835.52+273258.9 (WISE 1738) is an isolated Y0 brown dwarf with a temperature between 350-400 K, at the T-Y transition. While its near-infrared spectrum has been studied, bulk properties and chemistry remain uncertain. We analyze new JWST MIRI medium-resolution spectra (5-18 micron), combined with near-infrared spectra (0.98-2.2 micron) from HST/WFC3 and Gemini/GNIRS, to better constrain WISE 1738's atmosphere and physical parameters. We use Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) with a cloud-free petitRADTRANS model and evaluate results using posterior checks, coverage, and L-C2ST diagnostics. Our retrieval confirms previous constraints on H2O, CH4, and NH3, and for the first time constrains CO, CO2, and 15NH3. We find evidence of disequilibrium chemistry through CO and CO2 abundances not expected under equilibrium. Estimated properties are temperature 402 (+12,-9) K, log g 4.43 (+0.26,-0.34) cm/s2, mass 13 (+11,-7) M_Jup, radius 1.14 (+0.03,-0.03) R_Jup, and bolometric luminosity -6.52 (+0.05,-0.04) log L/L_sun. Evolutionary models suggest an age between 1 and 4 Gyr, consistent with a 6-hour rotation. We place an upper bound on 15NH3, implying a 3-sigma lower limit on the 14N/15N ratio of 275. We also derive a C/O ratio of 1.35 (+0.39,-0.31) and metallicity of 0.34 (+0.12,-0.11), without accounting for oxygen sequestration.         |

|**Abstract**|            Binaries of two white dwarfs (WDs) are an important class of astrophysical objects that are theorized to lead to Type Ia supernovae and are also used to gain insight into complex processes involved in stellar binary evolution. We report the discovery of SDSS~J090618.44+022311.6, a rare post-common envelope binary of a hydrogen atmospheric DA WD and a DQ WD which shows carbon absorption features, and is only the fourth such binary known. We combine the available spectroscopic, photometric, and radial velocity data to provide a self-consistent model for the binary and discuss its history as a binary DA+DQ. The system has a period of 31.17 hours with masses of 0.42 M$_{\odot}$ for DA WD and 0.49 M$_{\odot}$ for DQ WD. The corresponding cooling ages point to an Algol type of evolution with the lower mass star evolving into a DA WD first and later the massive DQ WD is formed. The system has a merger timescale of 450 Gyrs and will lead to the formation of a massive WD. With this, the number of known DA+DQ WD binaries has increased to four, and we find that their stellar properties all lie in the same range. Detailed study of more such systems is vital to understand common processes involved in the formation of this rare class of binaries and give insights towards the broader picture of WD spectral evolution.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the first application of marked angular power spectra to weak lensing data, using maps from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 1 (HSC-Y1) survey. Marked convergence fields, constructed by weighting the convergence field with non-linear functions of its smoothed version, are designed to encode higher-order information while remaining computationally tractable. Using simulations tailored to the HSC-Y1 data, we test three mark functions that up- or down-weight different density environments. Our results show that combining multiple types of marked auto- and cross-spectra improves constraints on the clustering amplitude parameter $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$ by $\approx$43\% compared to standard two-point power spectra. When applied to the HSC-Y1 data, this translates into a constraint on $S_8 = 0.807\pm 0.024$. We assess the sensitivity of the marked power spectra to systematics, including baryonic effects, intrinsic alignment, photometric redshifts, and multiplicative shear bias. These results demonstrate the promise of marked statistics as a practical and powerful tool for extracting non-Gaussian information from weak lensing surveys.         |
