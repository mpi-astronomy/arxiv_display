|**Abstract**|            As the fiftieth anniversary of our common effort in the field of relativistic astrophysics is approaching, we offer a new look to some of our acquired knowledge in a more complete view, which evidence previous unnoticed connections. They are gaining due prominence in reaching a more complete picture evidencing the main results. We outline the history of GRB observations along with a summary of the contributions made by our group to develop the BdHN interpreting model. We show the seven Episodes characterizing the most powerful BdHNe I occurred to date: GRB 190114C and GRB 220101A. New inferences for the explanation of the highest energy radiation in the TeV are presented.         |
