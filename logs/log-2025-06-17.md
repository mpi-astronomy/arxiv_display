|**Abstract**|            The gas-phase metallicity gradients of galaxies have been extensively studied over the past four decades both in the local and high-redshift universe, as they trace the baryon cycle and growth of galaxies. With the unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it is now possible to measure metallicity and its radial gradients out to redshifts as high as $z = 9$. Here, we present a sample of 456 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies from redshifts $1.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 9$ that are spatially resolved on sub-kiloparsec (kpc) scales by deep JWST NIRCam or NIRISS Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS). Synthesizing these new JWST observations with legacy observations from the literature, we observe that at redshift $z > 5$, galaxy centers are more metal-rich, exhibiting negative metallicity gradients of $\sim-0.4$ dex kpc$^{-1}$. These gradients flatten over time, reaching near-zero around $z \approx 2$, coinciding with the peak of the cosmic star formation rate. Beyond this point, the gradients become negative again at lower redshifts approaching $z=0$. This evolution likely reflects transitions in galaxy formation modes: an inside-out growth phase dominated by intense central star formation with inefficient feedback and limited gas mixing during ``cosmic dawn", enhanced gas mixing due to feedback-driven wind and gas accretion at ``cosmic noon", and a later phase of slow evolution and reduced feedback toward the present day. These physical processes including gas accretion and feedback not only regulate star and galaxy formation on cosmic scale, but also shape the evolutionary pathways of individual galaxies over cosmic time.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present 90 GHz continuum imaging of 119 star-forming regions in 30 nearby galaxies observed with MUSTANG-2 on the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope as part of the Star Formation in Radio Survey. The 90 GHz data were combined with 3, 15, and 33 GHz data taken previously by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to decompose radio spectra on $\approx$0.8 kpc scales into their synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust emission components. This was done using three scenarios: (i) a power law fit from 3 to 33 GHz, (ii) Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting from 3 to 90 GHz with a thermal dust component, and (iii) MCMC fitting from 3 to 33 GHz without a thermal dust component. For these cases, we find a median thermal (free-free) emission fraction at 33 GHz of (i) $88 \pm 2$% with a scatter of 17%, (ii) $76\pm 3$% with a scatter of 25%, and (iii) $84\pm 2$% with a scatter of 18%. From this we conclude that, on average, free-free, not thermal dust, remains the dominant emission component at 33 GHz. While scenario (ii) yields a thermal fraction that is $\approx$10% larger than scenario (iii), this difference decreases to $\approx$5% after AGN are removed. Consequently, star formation rates measured with thermal fractions at 33 GHz are only mildly biased high without 90 GHz data for the spectral decomposition. Furthermore, a power law fit of data from 3 to 33 GHz still provides a reliable estimate of the free-free emission at 33 GHz.         |

|**Abstract**|            Recent hydrodynamical simulations of isolated barred disc galaxies have suggested a structural change in the distribution of the interstellar medium (ISM) around a stellar mass M$_{*}$ of $10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$. In the higher-mass regime (M$_{*} \geq 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$), we observe the formation of a central gas and stellar disc with a typical size of a few hundred parsecs connected through lanes to the ends of the stellar bar. In the lower-mass regime (M$_{*} < 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$), such an inner disc is absent and the gas component exhibits a more chaotic distribution. Observations of nearby star-forming galaxies support the existence of such a change. These inner gas discs may represent an important intermediate scale connecting the large kiloparsec-scale structures with the nuclear (sub-parsec) region, transporting gas inwards to fuel the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). For this work, we used an extended set of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of isolated disc galaxies with initial properties (i.e. stellar mass, gas fraction, stellar disc scale length, and the bulge mass fraction) with properties covering the range of galaxies in the PHANGS sample to investigate this change of regime. We studied the physical properties of the star-forming ISM in both stellar mass regimes and extracted a few physical tracers: the inner Lindblad resonance (ILR), the probability distribution function (PDF), the virial parameter, and the Mach number. In line with observations, we confirm a structure transition in the simulations that occurs between a stellar mass of $10^{9.5}$ and $10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$. We show that the physical origin of this change of regime is driven by stellar feedback and its contribution relative to the underlying gravitational potential.         |

|**Abstract**|            The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is one of the most important astrophysical distribution function, and is defined as the mass distribution for stars formed in a single star-formation event and when they just enter the main-sequence stage. The measurement of IMF is challenging even in the solar neighbourhood where IMF can be extracted by star-counting. This is because the definition of the IMF should be handled cautiously, and there are multiple corrections should be made from observation to a well-founded measurement. We present a new parametrisation of the stellar IMF in the 100-pc solar neighbourhood, leveraging the astrometric and photometric data from \textsl{Gaia} DR3: we model the colour-magnitude diagram of the field star population while accounting for observational uncertainties, Malmquist bias, Lutz-Kelker bias, the effect of varying mass-luminosity relation caused by mixture of different metallicity, and the effect of unresolved binaries. In particular, we synthesise the binaries with a process imitating the dynamical evolution observed in star clusters to model their present-day mass-ratio distribution. We derive a stellar IMF consistent with canonical IMFs but with significantly reduced uncertainties: $\alpha_1=0.81^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$, $\alpha_2=2.12^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, and a break point at $m_{\mathrm{break}}=0.41^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Our model also constrains the binary fraction to $\sim$25\% and the \textsl{Gaia} DR3 angular resolution to $1.31^{+0.24}_{-0.29}$ arcsec. We also provide the $\xi$-parameter for our IMF to be $0.5075_{-0.0051}^{+0.0112}$ for the users to compare our result with other work.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present an analysis of the polarization of three black widow pulsars, PSRs B1957+20, J2055+3829 and J1544+4937 at 1250\,MHz using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Radio eclipses for PSRs B1957+20 and J2055+3829 are detected, while the radio emission for J1544+4937 is detected throughout the eclipse. We study the polarization and dispersion measure properties of the pulsars near and during the eclipse. The position angle of the linear polarization is observed to shift at the eclipse boundary in all of these three pulsars implying a lower limit line-of-sight magnetic field strength of the eclipse medium of approximately a few mG to tens of mG. We also find evidence that the magnetic field in the eclipse medium of PSRs B1957+20 and J1544+4937 reverses.         |

|**Abstract**|            In the standard model of solar eruptive events, coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and flares are associated with each other through magnetic reconnection initiated by erupting flux ropes. Observations also reveal an increasing association ratio between flares and CMEs with flare intensity. However, the fundamental relationship between flares and CMEs, and that between thermal and nonthermal processes, remains unknown. Here we investigate energetic C-class flares (ECFs) -- Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) C-class flares with hard X-ray (HXR) emissions above 30 keV -- using observations from Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory/Hard X-ray Imager (HXI), Solar Dynamic Observatory, and GOES. Among 1331 C-class flares detected by HXI, 127 ECFs (9.5%) were identified for statistical analysis of their properties and associations with CMEs and other flare-related features. Our statistical results reveal that ECFs have relatively shorter durations and harder spectra (the mean electron power-law index is 4.65), with no significant correlation between soft X-ray flux and nonthermal parameters (e.g., HXR peak flux). Among the 127 events, 53 (42%) were associated with type III bursts, 38 (30%) with jets, at least 13 (~11%) with 360 nm brightenings, and only 5 (~4%) with CMEs. Crucially, all five CME events were narrow CMEs associated with jets. The surprising correlation between these ECFs and CMEs suggests that noneruptive or confined magnetic field configurations in these flares may favor electron acceleration, resulting in harder X-ray this http URL discuss the potential formation mechanisms and efficient electron acceleration processes in these atypical flares, providing valuable insights into nonstandard flare behavior.         |

|**Abstract**|            Tracking the correlation between radio and X-ray luminosities during black hole X-ray binary outbursts is a key diagnostic of the coupling between accretion inflows (traced by X-rays) and relativistic jet outflows (traced by radio). We present the radio--X-ray correlation of the black hole low-mass X-ray binary Swift~J1727.8$-$1613 during its 2023--2024 outburst. Our observations span a broad dynamic range, covering $\sim$4 orders of magnitude in radio luminosity and $\sim$6.5 in X-ray luminosity. This source follows an unusually radio-quiet track, exhibiting significantly lower radio luminosities at a given X-ray luminosity than both the standard (radio-loud) track and most previously known radio-quiet systems. Across most of the considered distance range ($D {\sim} 1.5--4.3$ kpc), Swift~J1727.8$-$1613 appears to be the most radio-quiet black hole binary identified to date. For distances ${\geq} 4$ kpc, while Swift~J1727.8$-$1613 becomes comparable to one other extremely radio-quiet system, its peak X-ray luminosity (${\gtrsim} 5{\times}10^{38}$ erg/s) exceeds that of any previously reported hard-state black hole low-mass X-ray binary, emphasising the extremity of this outburst. Additionally, for the first time in a radio-quiet system, we identify the onset of X-ray spectral softening to coincide with a change in trajectory through the radio--X-ray plane. We assess several proposed explanations for radio-quiet behaviour in black hole systems in light of this dataset. As with other such sources, however, no single mechanism fully accounts for the observed properties, highlighting the importance of regular monitoring and the value of comprehensive (quasi-)simultaneous datasets.         |

|**Abstract**|            A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a star travels too close to a supermassive black hole. In some cases, accretion of the disrupted material onto the black hole launches a relativistic jet. In this paper, we present a long term observing campaign to study the radio and sub-millimeter emission associated with the fifth jetted/relativistic TDE: AT2022cmc. Our campaign reveals a long lived counterpart. We fit three different models to our data: a non-thermal jet, a spherical outflow consisting of both thermal and non-thermal electrons, and a jet with thermal and non-thermal electrons. We find that the data is best described by a relativistic spherical outflow propagating into an environment with a density profile following R^-1.8. Comparison of AT2022cmc to other TDEs finds agreement in the density profile of the environment but also that AT2022cmc is twice as energetic as the other well-studied relativistic TDE Swift J1644. Our observations of AT2022cmc allow a thermal electron population to be inferred for the first time in a jetted transient providing, new insights into the microphysics of relativistic transients jets.         |

|**Abstract**|            Quasar outflows can play a crucial role in the evolution of their host galaxies through various feedback processes. This effect is expected to be particularly important when the universe was only 2-3 billion years old, during the period known as cosmic noon. By utilizing observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopy Instrument (DESI), we conduct a survey of high-ionization quasar outflows at cosmic noon, with the aim of doubling the current sample of such outflows with distance and energetics determination. We also aim to compare these properties to those derived from spatially resolved outflows in similar quasars probed through Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS). In a sample of 130 quasars we detect signatures of high-ionization outflows in the form of a S IV trough in eight objects. We characterize the physical conditions of these outflows by determining their total hydrogen column density ($N_H$), ionization parameter ($U_H$), and electron number density ($n_e$). The detected outflows show complex kinematic structures with a wide range in blueshifted velocities (100$-$4600 km s$^{-1}$). We locate five out of the eight outflows at distances between 240$-$5500 pc away from the central source. From the combined sample of 15 high-ionization S IV outflows at cosmic noon, we find a high fraction (up to 46 %) of them to be powerful enough to contribute significantly to multi-stage AGN feedback processes. Their mass outflow rates and kinetic luminosities are also found to be consistent with spatially resolved outflows in a luminosity and redshift matched sample of quasars. Comparison with previous spectra reveals interesting variations in some objects, with two cases of emerging high-velocity broad absorption line features with velocities of $-$8000 and $-$39,000 km s$^{-1}$. An impressive case of four line-locked Si IV outflow systems is also revealed in one of the objects.         |
