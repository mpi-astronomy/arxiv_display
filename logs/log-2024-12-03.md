|**Abstract**|            The dynamic of relativistic jets in the inner parsec regions is deeply affected by the nature of the magnetic fields. The level of magnetization of the plasma, as well as the geometry of these fields on compact scales, have not yet been fully constrained. In this paper we employ multi-frequency and multi-epoch very long baseline interferometry observations of the nearby radio galaxy NGC 315. We aim to derive insights into the magnetic field properties on sub-parsec and parsec scales by examining observational signatures such as the spectral index, synchrotron turnover frequency, and brightness temperature profiles. This analysis is performed by considering the properties of the jet acceleration and collimation zone, which can be probed thanks to the source vicinity, as well as the inner part of the jet conical region. We observe remarkably steep values for the spectral index on sub-parsec scales ($\alpha \sim -2$, $S_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$) which flatten around $\alpha \sim -0.8$ on parsec scales. We suggest that the observed steep values may result from particles being accelerated via diffusive shock acceleration mechanisms in magnetized plasma and subsequently experiencing cooling through synchrotron losses. The brightness temperature of the 43 GHz cores indicates a dominance of the magnetic energy at the jet base, while the cores at progressively lower frequencies reveal a gradual transition towards equipartition. Based on the spectral index and brightness temperature along the incoming jet, and by employing theoretical models, we derive that the magnetic field strength has a close-to-linear dependence with distance going from parsec scales up to the jet apex. Overall, our findings are consistent with a toroidal-dominated magnetic field on all the analyzed scales.         |

|**Abstract**|            The production of silicon monoxide (SiO) can be considered as a fingerprint of shock interaction. In this work, we use high-sensitivity observations of the SiO (2-1) and H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ (1-0) emission to investigate the broad and narrow SiO emission toward 146 massive star-forming regions in the ATOMS survey. We detected SiO emission in 136 regions and distinguished broad and narrow components across the extension of 118 sources (including 58 UC $H_{II}$ regions) with an average angular resolution of 2.5$^{\prime}$$^{\prime}$. The derived SiO luminosity ($L_{SiO}$) across the whole sample shows that the majority of $L_{SiO}$ (above 66$\%$) can be attributed to broad SiO, indicating its association with strong outflows. The comparison of the ALMA SiO images with the filamentary skeletons identified from H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and in the infrared data (at 4.5, 8, and 24 $mu$m), further confirms that most SiO emission originates from outflows. However, note that for nine sources in our sample, the observed SiO emission may be generated by expanding UC $H_{II}$ regions. There is a moderate positive correlation between the bolometric luminosity ($L_{bol}$) and $L_{SiO}$ for both components (narrow and broad). The UC $H_{II}$ sources show a weaker positive correlation between $L_{bol}$ and $L_{SiO}$ and higher $L_{SiO}$ compared to the sources without UC $H_{II}$ regions. These results imply that the SiO emission from UC $H_{II}$ sources might be affected by UV-photochemistry induced by UC $H_{II}$ regions.         |

|**Abstract**|            The recently launched James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is opening new observing windows on the distant universe. Among JWST's instruments, the Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI) offers the unique capability of imaging observations at wavelengths $\lambda > 5\mu$m. This enables unique access to the rest frame near infra-red (NIR, $\lambda \ge 1$\mum) emission from galaxies at redshifts $z>4$ and the visual ($\lambda \gtrsim 5000$Å) rest frame for $z>9$. We here report on the guaranteed time observations (GTO) from the MIRI European Consortium, of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), forming the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS), consisting of an on source integration time of $\sim41$ hours in the MIRI/F560W (5.6 $\mu$m) filter. To our knowledge, this constitutes the longest single filter exposure obtained with JWST of an extragalactic field as yet.         |

|**Abstract**|            Type Ia supernovae, critical for studying cosmic expansion, arise from thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs, but their precise progenitor pathways remain unclear. Growing evidence supports the ``double-degenerate'' scenario, where two white dwarfs interact. The absence of other companion types capable of explaining the observed Ia rate, along with observations of hyper-velocity white dwarfs interpreted as surviving companions of such systems provide compelling evidence in favor of this scenario. Upcoming millihertz gravitational wave observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are expected to detect thousands of double-degenerate systems, though the most compact known candidate Ia progenitors produce only marginally detectable gravitational wave signals. Here, we report observations of ATLAS J1138-5139, a binary white dwarf system with an orbital period of 28 minutes. Our analysis reveals a 1 solar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreting from a helium-core white dwarf. Given its mass, the accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarf is poised to trigger a typical-luminosity Type Ia supernova within a few million years, or to evolve into a stably mass-transferring AM CVn system. ATLAS J1138-5139 provides a rare opportunity to calibrate binary evolution models by directly comparing observed orbital parameters and mass transfer rates closer to merger than any previously identified candidate Type Ia progenitor. Its compact orbit ensures detectability by LISA, demonstrating the potential of millihertz gravitational wave observatories to reveal a population of Type Ia progenitors on a Galactic scale, paving the way for multi-messenger studies offering insights into the origins of these cosmologically significant explosions.         |

|**Abstract**|            The circumgalactic medium (CGM), as the gas repository for star formation, might contain the answer to the mysterious galaxy quenching and bimodal galaxy population origin. We measured the X-ray emission of the hot CGM around star-forming and quiescent galaxies. We detect extended X-ray emission from the hot CGM around star-forming galaxies with $\log(M_*/M_\odot)>11.0$ and quiescent galaxies with $\log(M_*/M_\odot)>10.5$, extending out to $R_{\rm 500c}$. $L_{\rm X, CGM}$ of star-forming galaxies with median stellar masses $\log(M_{\rm *,med}/M_\odot) = 10.7, 11.1, 11.3$ are approximately $0.8\,, 2.3\,, 4.0 \times 10^{40}\,\rm erg/s$, while for quiescent galaxies with $\log(M_{\rm *,med}/M_\odot) = 10.8, 11.1, 11.4$, they are $1.1\,, 6.2\,, 30 \times 10^{40}\,\rm erg/s$. Notably, quiescent galaxies with $\log(M_{\rm *,med}/M_\odot) > 11.0$ exhibit brighter hot CGM than their star-forming counterparts. In halo mass bins, we detect similar X-ray emission around star-forming and quiescent galaxies with $\log(M_{\rm 200m}/M_\odot) > 12.5$, suggesting that galaxies in the same mass dark matter halos host equally bright hot CGM. We emphasize the observed $L_{\rm X, CGM} - M_{\rm 500c}$ relations of star-forming and quiescent galaxies are sensitive to the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR). A comparison with cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (EAGLE, TNG100, and SIMBA) reveals varying degrees of agreement, contingent on the simulation and the specific stellar or halo mass ranges considered. Either selected in stellar mass or halo mass, the star-forming galaxies do not host brighter stacked X-ray emission from the hot CGM than their quiescent counterparts at the same mass range. The result provides useful constraints on the extent of feedback's impacts as a mechanism for quenching star formation as implemented in current cosmological simulations.         |

|**Abstract**|            This work focuses on the ice features toward the binary protostellar system Ced 110 IRS 4A and 4B, and observed with JWST as part of the Early Release Science Ice Age collaboration. We aim to explore the JWST observations of the binary protostellar system Ced~110~IRS4A and IRS4B to unveil and quantify the ice inventories toward these sources. We compare the ice abundances with those found for the same molecular cloud. The analysis is performed by fitting or comparing laboratory infrared spectra of ices to the observations. Spectral fits are carried out with the ENIIGMA fitting tool that searches for the best fit. For Ced~110~IRS4B, we detected the major ice species H$_2$O, CO, CO$_2$ and NH$_3$. All species are found in a mixture except for CO and CO$_2$, which have both mixed and pure ice components. In the case of Ced~110~IRS4A, we detected the same major species as in Ced~110~IRS4B, as well as the following minor species CH$_4$, SO$_2$, CH$_3$OH, OCN$^-$, NH$_4^+$ and HCOOH. Tentative detection of N$_2$O ice (7.75~$\mu$m), forsterite dust (11.2~$\mu$m) and CH$_3^+$ gas emission (7.18~$\mu$m) in the primary source are also presented. Compared with the two lines of sight toward background stars in the Chameleon I molecular cloud, the protostar has similar ice abundances, except in the case of the ions that are higher in IRS4A. The clearest differences are the absence of the 7.2 and 7.4~$\mu$m absorption features due to HCOO$^-$ and icy complex organic molecules in IRS4A and evidence of thermal processing in both IRS4A and IRS4B as probed by the CO$_2$ ice features. We conclude that the binary protostellar system Ced~110~IRS4A and IRS4B has a large inventory of icy species. The similar ice abundances in comparison to the starless regions in the same molecular cloud suggest that the chemical conditions of the protostar were set at earlier stages in the molecular cloud.         |

|**Abstract**|            Quiet-Sun regions cover most of the Sun's surface; its magnetic fields contribute significantly to the solar chromospheric and coronal heating. However, characterizing the magnetic fields of the quiet Sun is challenging due to their weak polarization signal. The 4-m \textit{Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope} (\textit{DKIST}) is expected to improve our understanding of the quiet-Sun magnetism. In this paper, we assess the diagnostic capability of the Diffraction-Limited Near Infrared Spectropolarimeter (DL-NIRSP) instrument on \textit{DKIST} on the energy transport processes in the quiet-Sun photosphere. To this end, we synthesize high-resolution, high-cadence Stokes profiles of the \ion{Fe}{1} 630~nm lines using a realistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation, degrade them to emulate the \textit{DKIST}/DL-NIRSP observations, and subsequently infer the vector magnetic and velocity fields. For the assessment, we first verify that a widely used flow-tracking algorithm, Differential Affine Velocity Estimator for Vector Magnetograms, works well for estimating the large-scale ($> 200$ km) photospheric velocity fields with these high-resolution data. We then examine how the accuracy of inferred velocity depends on the temporal resolution. Finally, we investigate the reliability of the Poynting flux estimate and its dependence on the model assumptions. The results suggest that the unsigned Poynting flux, estimated with existing schemes, can account for about $71.4\%$ and $52.6\%$ of the reference ground truth at $\log \tau =0.0$ and $\log \tau = -1$. However, the net Poynting flux tends to be significantly underestimated. The error mainly arises from the underestimated contribution of the horizontal motion. We discuss the implications on \textit{DKIST} observations.         |

|**Abstract**|            We analyse and model rapid rotations of polarization orientations in PSR B1919+21's single pulses, based on FAST observation data. In more than one third of B1919+21's single pulses, polarization angle (PA) is found to rotate quasi-monotonically with pulse longitude, by over 180 or even 360 degrees. Most of these quasi-monotonic PA curves have negative slopes with respect to pulse longitude. Oscillations of circular polarization fraction accompany these PA rotations. This rapid rotation could be induced by quick change of phase lag between normal wave modes within an individual pulse. We propose a phenomenological model to successfully reproduce the observed polarization rotations in single pulses, and calculate phase lags in a dipolar magnetic field of an aligned rotating pulsar, with a dispersion relation of orthogonal wave modes in strongly magnetized plasma. The weak frequency dependence of observed polarization rotation requires the radio emission height to be low, approximately 10 times the neutron star radius.         |
