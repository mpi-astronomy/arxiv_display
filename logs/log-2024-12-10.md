|**Abstract**|            We present a joint analysis of TTVs and Doppler data for the transiting exoplanet system TOI-4504. TOI-4504 c is a warm Jupiter-mass planet that exhibits the largest known transit timing variations (TTVs), with a peak-to-node amplitude of $\sim$ 2 days, the largest value ever observed, and a super-period of $\sim$ 930 d. TOI-4504 b and c were identified in public TESS data, while the TTVs observed in TOI-4504 c, together with radial velocity (RV) data collected with FEROS, allowed us to uncover a third, non-transiting planet in this system, TOI-4504 d. We were able to detect transits of TOI-4504 b in the TESS data with a period of 2.4261$\pm 0.0001$ days and derive a radius of 2.69$\pm 0.19$ R$_{\oplus}$. The RV scatter of TOI-4504 was too large to constrain the mass of TOI-4504 b, but the RV signals of TOI-4504 c \& d were sufficiently large to measure their masses. The TTV+RV dynamical model we apply confirms TOI-4504 c as a warm Jupiter planet with an osculating period of 82.54$\pm 0.02$ d, mass of 3.77$\pm 0.18$ M$_{\rm J}$ and a radius of 0.99$\pm 0.05$ R$_{\rm J}$, while the non-transiting planet TOI-4504 d, has an orbital period of 40.56$\pm 0.04$ days and mass of 1.42$_{-0.06}^{+0.07}$ M$_{\rm J}$. We present the discovery of a system with three exoplanets: a hot sub-Neptune and two warm Jupiter planets. The gas giant pair is stable and likely locked in a first-order 2:1 mean-motion resonance (MMR). The TOI-4504 system is an important addition to MMR pairs, whose increasing occurrence supports a smooth migration into a resonant configuration during the protoplanetary disk phase.         |

|**Abstract**|            Accurate measurements of europium abundances in cool stars are essential for an enhanced understanding of the r-process mechanisms. We measure the abundance of Eu in solar spectra and a sample of metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo and metal-poor disk, with the metallicities ranging from \GG{$-2.4$} to $-0.5$ dex, using non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) line formation. We compare these measurements with Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models to \GG{explore the impact of the NLTE corrections on the contribution of r-process site in Galactic chemical evolution. In this work, we use NLTE line formation, as well as one-dimensional (1D) hydrostatic and spatial averages of 3D hydrodynamical ($<$3D$>$) model atmospheres to measure the abundance of Eu based on both the Eu II 4129 Å and Eu II 6645 Å lines for solar spectra and metal-poor stars. We find that \GG{for Eu II 4129 Å line the NLTE modelling leads to higher (0.04 dex) solar Eu abundance in 1D and higher (0.07 dex) in \GG{$<$3D$>$} NLTE while} NLTE modelling leads to higher (0.01 dex) solar Eu abundance in 1D and lower (0.03 dex) in \GG{$<$3D$>$} NLTE for Eu II 6645 Å line. Although the NLTE corrections for the Eu II $\lambda$ 4129 Å and Eu II $\lambda$ 6645 Å lines are opposite, the discrepancy between the abundances derived from these individual lines reduces after applying NLTE corrections, highlighting the critical role of NLTE abundance determinations. By comparing these measurements with Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models, we find that the \G{amount of NLTE correction does not require significant change of the parameters for Eu production} in the GCE models.         |

|**Abstract**|            The synergy between different detection methods is a key asset in exoplanetology, allowing for both precise characterization of detected exoplanets and robust constraints even in the case of non-detection. Recently, the interplay between imaging, radial velocities and astrometry has produced significant advancements in exoplanetary science. We report a first result of an ongoing survey performed with SHARK-NIR, the new high-contrast near-infrared imaging camera at the Large Binocular Telescope, in parallel with LBTI/LMIRCam in order to detect planetary companions around stars with significant proper motion anomaly. In this work we focus on HD 57625, a F8 star for which we determine a $4.8^{+3.7}_{-2.9}$Ga age, exhibiting significant astrometric acceleration and for which archival radial velocities hint at the presence of a previously undetected massive long-period companion. We analyse the imaging data we collected with SHARK-NIR and LMIRCam in synergy with the available public SOPHIE radial velocity time series and Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion anomaly. With this joint multi-technique analysis, we aim at characterizing the companion responsible for the astrometric and radial velocity signals. The imaging observations result in a non-detection, indicating the companion to be in the substellar regime. This is confirmed by the synergic analysis of archival radial velocity and astrometric measurements resulting in the detection of HD 57625 b, a ${8.43}_{-0.91}^{+1.10}$M$_{\rm Jup}$ planetary companion with an orbital separation of ${5.70}_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$au and ${0.52}_{-0.03}^{+0.04}$ eccentricity. HD 57625 b joins the small but growing population of giant planets in outer orbits with true mass determination provided by the synergic usage of multiple detection methods, proving once again the importance of multi-technique analysis in providing robust characterization of planetary companions.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the discovery of two mini Neptunes near a 2:1 orbital resonance configuration orbiting the K0 star TOI-1803. We describe their orbital architecture in detail and suggest some possible formation and evolution scenarios. Using CHEOPS, TESS, and HARPS-N datasets we can estimate the radius and the mass of both planets. We used a multidimensional Gaussian Process with a quasi-periodic kernel to disentangle the planetary components from the stellar activity in the HARPS-N dataset. We performed dynamical modeling to explain the orbital configuration and performed planetary formation and evolution simulations. For the least dense planet, we define possible atmospheric characterization scenarios with simulated JWST observations. TOI-1803 b and TOI-1803 c have orbital periods of $\sim$6.3 and $\sim$12.9 days, respectively, residing in close proximity to a 2:1 orbital resonance. Ground-based photometric follow-up observations revealed significant transit timing variations (TTV) with an amplitude of $\sim$10 min and $\sim$40 min, respectively, for planet -b and -c. With the masses computed from the radial velocities data set, we obtained a density of (0.39$\pm$0.10) $\rho_{earth}$ and (0.076$\pm$0.038) $\rho_{earth}$ for planet -b and -c, respectively. TOI-1803 c is among the least dense mini Neptunes currently known, and due to its inflated atmosphere, it is a suitable target for transmission spectroscopy with JWST. We report the discovery of two mini Neptunes close to a 2:1 orbital resonance. The detection of significant TTVs from ground-based photometry opens scenarios for a more precise mass determination. TOI-1803 c is one of the least dense mini Neptune known so far, and it is of great interest among the scientific community since it could constrain our formation scenarios.         |

|**Abstract**|            The number of known periodic variable stars has increased rapidly in recent years. As an all-sky transit survey, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) plays an important role in detecting low-amplitude variable stars. Using 2-minute cadence data from the first 67 sectors of TESS, we find 72,505 periodic variable stars. We used 19 parameters including period, physical parameters, and light curve (LC) parameters to classify periodic variable stars into 12 sub-types using random forest method. Pulsating variable stars and eclipsing binaries are distinguished mainly by period, LC parameters and physical parameters. GCAS, ROT, UV, YSO are distinguished mainly by period and physical parameters. Compared to previously published catalogs, 63,106 periodic variable stars (87.0$\%$) are newly classified, including 13 Cepheids, 27 RR Lyrae stars, $\sim$4,600 $\delta$ Scuti variable stars, $\sim$1,600 eclipsing binaries, $\sim$34,000 rotational variable stars, and about 23,000 other types of variable stars. The purity of eclipsing binaries and pulsation variable stars ranges from 94.2$\%$ to 99.4$\%$ when compared to variable star catalogs of Gaia DR3 and ZTF DR2. The purity of ROT is relatively low at 83.3$\%$. The increasing number of variables stars is helpful to investigate the structure of the Milky Way, stellar physics, and chromospheric activity.         |

|**Abstract**|            With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have introduced convenient and user-friendly methods for leveraging tools across various domains. In the field of astronomical observation, the construction of new telescopes has significantly increased astronomers' workload. Deploying LLM-powered agents can effectively alleviate this burden and reduce the costs associated with training personnel. Within the Nearby Galaxy Supernovae Survey (NGSS) project, which encompasses eight telescopes across three observation sites, aiming to find the transients from the galaxies in 50 mpc, we have developed the \textbf{StarWhisper Telescope System} to manage the entire observation process. This system automates tasks such as generating observation lists, conducting observations, analyzing data, and providing feedback to the observer. Observation lists are customized for different sites and strategies to ensure comprehensive coverage of celestial objects. After manual verification, these lists are uploaded to the telescopes via the agents in the system, which initiates observations upon neutral language. The observed images are analyzed in real-time, and the transients are promptly communicated to the observer. The agent modifies them into a real-time follow-up observation proposal and send to the Xinglong observatory group chat, then add them to the next-day observation lists. Additionally, the integration of AI agents within the system provides online accessibility, saving astronomers' time and encouraging greater participation from amateur astronomers in the NGSS project.         |
