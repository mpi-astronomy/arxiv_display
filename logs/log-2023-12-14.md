|**Abstract**| We investigate the bright CO fundamental emission in the central regions of five Class 0 protostars using the JWST's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and provide clues to what processes excite the gas. CO line emission images are extracted for a forest of $\sim$150 ro-vibrational transitions from two vibrational bands, $v=1-0$ and $v=2-1$. However, ${}^{13}$CO is not detected, and thus we can only statistically constrain the ${}^{12}$CO optical depth. Using noise measurements to determine upper limits to the ${}^{13}$CO emission, the flux ratio of ${}^{12}$CO/${}^{13}$CO indicates that the ${}^{12}$CO emission itself is not optically thick for ro-vibrational transitions with upper state rotational quantum number $J_u \geq 15$. We construct population diagrams to estimate the rotational temperature and number of molecules from extinction-corrected CO line fluxes assuming CO emission is optically thin. Two different temperature components are required for $v=1$ ($\sim600-1000$ K and $\sim1500-3500$ K), while one hotter component is required for $v=2$ ($\sim2000-6000$ K). The vibrational temperature is $\sim 900$ K among our sources and shows no trend with luminosity. Using vibrational temperatures and the inferred total amount of CO molecules for our sources, the total warm gas mass correlates strongly with luminosity ranging from $\sim$0.1 $\rm M_{Earth}$ for the low-mass protostars to $\sim$1 M$_{\rm sun}$ for the high-mass protostars. Interpreting the distribution of gas column densities and temperatures depends on radiative and chemical processes affecting CO. The presence of a $v=2$ population may indicate CO gas radiatively excited. Selective UV photodissociation of CO isotopologues around our high-mass sources may explain their depletion of ${}^{13}$CO. |

|**Abstract**| The Planck space mission has observed the first three rotational lines of emission of Galactic CO. Those maps, however, are either noisy, or contaminated by astrophysical emissions from different origin. We revisit those data products to deliver new full-sky CO maps with low astrophysical contamination and significantly enhanced noise properties. To that effect, a specific pipeline is designed to evaluate and postprocess the existing Planck Galactic CO maps. Specifically, we use an extension of the Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination method to extract multi-component astrophysical emissions from multi-frequency observations. Well characterized, clean CO full-sky maps at $10^\prime$ angular resolution are produced. These maps are made available to the scientific community and can be used to trace CO emission over the entire sky, and to generate sky simulations in preparation for future CMB observations. |

|| D. Ye, C. Du, <mark>J. Shi</mark>, J. Ma |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-12-14*|
|*Comments*| *12 pages, 6 Figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**| Based on 4,\,098 very metal-poor (VMP) stars with 6D phase-space and chemical information from \textit{Gaia} DR3 and LAMOST DR9 as tracers, we apply an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN), to identify stellar groups in the action-energy (\textbf{\textit{J}}-$E$) space. We detect seven previously known mergers in local samples, including Helmi Stream, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), Metal-weak Thick Disk (MWTD), Pontus, Wukong, Thamnos, and I'itoi+Sequoia+Arjuna. According to energy, we further divide GSE and Wukong into smaller parts to explore the orbital characteristics of individual fragments. Similarly, the division of Thamnos is based on action. It can be found that the apocentric distances of GSE parts of high and medium energy levels are located at $29.5\pm3.6\,{\rm kpc}$ and $13.0\pm2.7\,{\rm kpc}$, respectively, which suggests that GSE could account for breaks in the density profile of the Galactic halo at both $\approx30$\,kpc and $15\text{-}18$\,kpc. The VMP stars of MWTD move along prograde orbits with larger eccentricities than those of its more metal-rich stars, which indicates that the VMP part of MWTD may be formed by accreting with dwarf galaxies. Finally, we summarize all substructures discovered in our local VMP samples. Our results provide a reference for the formation and evolution of the inner halo of the Milky Way (MW). |
