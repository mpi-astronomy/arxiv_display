|**Abstract**|            Galaxy proto-clusters are receiving an increased interest since most of the processes shaping the structure of clusters of galaxies and their galaxy population are happening at early stages of their formation. The Euclid Survey will provide a unique opportunity to discover a large number of proto-clusters over a large fraction of the sky (14 500 square degrees). In this paper, we explore the expected observational properties of proto-clusters in the Euclid Wide Survey by means of theoretical models and simulations. We provide an overview of the predicted proto-cluster extent, galaxy density profiles, mass-richness relations, abundance, and sky-filling as a function of redshift. Useful analytical approximations for the functions of these properties are provided. The focus is on the redshift range z= 1.5 to 4. We discuss in particular the density contrast with which proto-clusters can be observed against the background in the galaxy distribution if photometric galaxy redshifts are used as supplied by the ESA Euclid mission together with the ground-based photometric surveys. We show that the obtainable detection significance is sufficient to find large numbers of interesting proto-cluster candidates. For quantitative studies, additional spectroscopic follow-up is required to confirm the proto-clusters and establish their richness.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the abundances of magnesium (Mg) and silicon (Si) for 314 dwarf stars with spectral types in the interval K7.0-M5.5 (Teff range ~4200-3050 K) observed with the CARMENES high-resolution spectrograph at the 3.5 m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory. Our analysis employs the BT-Settl model atmospheres, the radiative transfer code Turbospectrum, and a state-of-the-art selection of atomic and molecular data. These Mg and Si abundances are critical for understanding both the chemical evolution and assembly of the Milky Way and the formation and composition of rocky planets. Our chemical abundances show a line-to-line scatter at the level of 0.1 dex for all studied spectral types. The typical error bar of our chemical abundance measurements is +- 0.11 dex (Mg) and +- 0.16 dex (Si) for all spectral types based on the comparison of the results obtained for stellar components of multiple systems. The derived abundances are consistent with the galactic evolution trends and observed chemical abundance distribution of earlier FGK-type stars in the solar neighbourhood. Besides, our analysis provides compatible abundances for stars in multiple systems. In addition, we studied the abundances of different galactic stellar populations. In this paper, we also explore the relation of the Mg and Si abundances of stars with and without known planets.         |

|**Abstract**|            A rich inventory of complex organic molecules (COMs) has been observed in high abundances in the gas phase toward Class 0 protostars. These molecules are suggested to be formed in ices and sublimate in the warm inner envelope close to the protostar. However, only the most abundant COM, methanol (CH3OH), has been firmly detected in ices before the era of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Now it is possible to detect the interstellar ices of other COMs and constrain their ice column densities quantitatively. We aim to determine the column densities of several oxygen-bearing COMs (O-COMs) in both gas and ice for two low-mass protostellar sources, NGC 1333 IRAS 2A and B1-c, as case studies in our JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS+) program. By comparing the column density ratios w.r.t. CH3OH between both phases measured in the same sources, we can probe into the evolution of COMs from ice to gas in the early stages of star formation. We are able to fit the fingerprints range of COM ices between 6.8 and 8.8 um in the JWST/MIRI-MRS spectra of B1-c using similar components as recently used for IRAS 2A. We claim detection of CH4, OCN-, HCOO-, HCOOH, CH3CHO, C2H5OH, CH3OCH3, CH3OCHO, and CH3COCH3 in B1-c, and upper limits are estimated for SO2, CH3COOH, and CH3CN. The comparison of O-COM ratios w.r.t CH3OH between ice and gas shows two different cases. 1) the column density ratios of CH3OCHO and CH3OCH3 match well between the two phases, which may be attributed to a direct inheritance from ice to gas or strong chemical links with CH3OH. 2) the ice ratios of CH3CHO and C2H5OH w.r.t. CH3OH are higher than the gas ratios by 1-2 orders of magnitudes. This difference can be explained by the gas-phase reprocessing following sublimation, or different spatial distributions of COMs in the envelope.         |

|**Abstract**|            Despite the established role of additive manufacturing (AM) in aerospace and medical fields, its adoption in astronomy remains low. Encouraging AM integration in a risk-averse community necessitates documentation and dissemination of previous case studies. The objective of this study is to create the first review of AM in astronomy hardware, answering: where is AM currently being used in astronomy, what is the status of its adoption, and what challenges are preventing its widespread use? The review starts with an introduction to astronomical instruments size/cost challenges, alongside the role of manufacturing innovation. This is followed by highlighting the benefits/challenges of AM and used materials/processes in both space-based and ground-based applications. The review case studies include mirrors, optomechanical structures, compliant mechanisms, brackets and tooling applications that are either in research phase or are implemented.         |

|**Abstract**|            We perform a thorough analysis of the projected shapes of nearby galaxies in both observations and cosmological simulations. We implement a forward-modeling approach to overcome the limitations in previous studies which hinder accurate comparisons between observations and simulations. We measure axis ratios of $z=0$ (snapshot 99) TNG50 galaxies from their synthetic Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) images and compare them with those obtained from real HSC-SSP images of a matched galaxy sample. Remarkably, the comparison shows excellent agreement between observations and the TNG50 simulation. Specifically, for galaxies with stellar masses $10\leq \log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \leq 11.5$, we find $\lesssim 0.1\sigma$ tensions between the observation and the simulation, whereas previous studies found $\gtrsim 10\sigma$ tensions due to lack of thin galaxies in simulations. We reveal that low-mass galaxies ($M_{\star}\lesssim 10^{9.5}$) in TNG50 are thicker than their observed counterparts in HSC-SSP and attribute this to the spurious dynamical heating effects that artificially puff up galaxies. We also find that despite the overall broad agreement, TNG50 galaxies are more concentrated than the HSC-SSP ones at the low- and high-mass end of the stellar mass range of $9.0\leq \log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \leq 11.2$ and are less concentrated at intermediate stellar masses. But we argue that the higher concentrations of the low-mass TNG50 galaxies are not likely the cause of their thicker/rounder appearances. Our study underscores the critical importance of conducting mock observations of simulations and applying consistent measurement methodologies to facilitate proper comparison with observations.         |

|**Abstract**|            IGR J17091-3624, in addition to GRS 1915+105, is the only black hole X-ray binary that displays ``heartbeat"-like variability characterized by structured flares with high amplitudes. In this study, we conduct a detailed phase-resolved analysis of the recently identified ``heartbeat"-like Class X variability in IGR J17091-3624 during its 2022 outburst, utilizing data from NICER and NuSTAR observations. A shortage in the high-energy (>20 keV) X-ray flux is detected at peak phases of the soft X-ray flare at a ~15 sigma confidence level from the phase-folded light curves. Furthermore, our phase-resolved spectral analysis reveals variations in the spectral shape, particularly showing significant synchronous variations in the disk temperature and flux with the count rate. These findings imply that the flare is primarily driven by instabilities within the accretion disk, consistent with previous studies on the well-known Class rho variability in GRS 1915+105. However, we also observe a positive correlation between the disk temperature and flux over the flare cycle, which differs from a loop relation between the two parameters found in the Class rho variability. This could suggest differences in underlying physical processes between the two variability classes. Variations in the Componization component during flares are also observed: the electron temperature and covering fraction show anti-correlations with the disk flux, revealing potential interactions between the accretion disk and the corona during these flares.         |

|**Abstract**|            The interaction between axion-like particles (ALPs) and photons induces ALP-photon oscillations in astrophysical magnetic fields, leading to spectral distortions in the $\gamma$-ray spectrum of blazars. The primary uncertainty of this phenomenon may originate from the magnetic field within the jet of the blazar. While many studies have explored the effects of ALP-photon oscillations using typical values for jet magnetic field parameters, it is important to recognize that these parameters can be constrained by multi-wavelength observations. In this study, we utilize the high energy $\gamma$-ray spectrum of Mrk 421 obtained from MAGIC and Fermi-LAT observations. By employing multi-wavelength fitting with a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model, we derive the parameters characterizing the magnetic field model within the jet, and investigate their impacts on the ALP constraints.         |

|**Abstract**|            The turbulent ionosphere causes phase shifts to incoming radio waves on a broad range of temporal and spatial scales. When an interferometer is not sufficiently calibrated for the direction-dependent ionospheric effects, the time-varying phase shifts can cause the signal to decorrelate. The ionosphere's influence over various spatiotemporal scales introduces a baseline-dependent effect on the interferometric array. We study the impact of baseline-dependent decorrelation on high-redshift observations with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). Datasets with a range of ionospheric corruptions are simulated using a thin-screen ionosphere model, and calibrated using the state-of-the-art LOFAR Epoch of Reionisation pipeline. For the first time ever, we show the ionospheric impact on various stages of the calibration process including an analysis of the transfer of gain errors from longer to shorter baselines using realistic end-to-end simulations. We find that direction-dependent calibration for source subtraction leaves excess power of up to two orders of magnitude above the thermal noise at the largest spectral scales in the cylindrically averaged auto-power spectrum under normal ionospheric conditions. However, we demonstrate that this excess power can be removed through Gaussian process regression, leaving no excess power above the ten per cent level for a $5~$km diffractive scale. We conclude that ionospheric errors, in the absence of interactions with other aggravating effects, do not constitute a dominant component in the excess power observed in LOFAR Epoch of Reionisation observations of the North Celestial Pole. Future work should therefore focus on less spectrally smooth effects, such as beam modelling errors.         |
