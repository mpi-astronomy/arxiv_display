|**Abstract**| Gaia can not individually resolve very close binary systems, however, the collected data can still be used to identify them. A powerful indicator of stellar multiplicity is the sources reported Renormalized Unit Weight Error (ruwe), which effectively captures the astrometric deviations from single-source solutions. We aim to characterise the imprints left on ruwe caused by binarity. By flagging potential binary systems based on ruwe, we aim to characterise which of their properties will contribute the most to their detectability. We develop a model to estimate ruwe values for observations of Gaia sources, based on the biases to the single-source astrometric track arising from the presence of an unseen companion. Then, using the recipes from previous GaiaUnlimited selection functions, we estimate the selection probability of sources with high ruwe, and discuss what binary properties contribute to increasing the sources ruwe. We compute the maximum ruwe value which is compatible with single-source solutions as a function of their location on-sky. We see that binary systems selected as sources with a ruwe higher than this sky-varying threshold have a strong detectability window in their orbital period distribution, which peaks at periods equal to the Gaia observation time baseline. We demonstrate how our sky-varying ruwe threshold provides a more complete sample of binary systems when compared to single sky-averaged values by studying the unresolved binary population in the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars. We provide the code and tools used in this study, as well as the sky-varying ruwe threshold through the GaiaUnlimited Python package |

|**Abstract**| In this paper, we describe the "Medium Bands, Mega Science" JWST Cycle 2 survey (JWST-GO-4111) and demonstrate the power of these data to reveal both the spatially-integrated and spatially-resolved properties of galaxies from the local universe to the era of cosmic dawn. Executed in November 2023, MegaScience obtained ~30 arcmin^2 of deep multiband NIRCam imaging centered on the z~0.3 Abell 2744 cluster, including eleven medium-band filters and the two shortest-wavelength broad-band filters, F070W and F090W. Together, MegaScience and the UNCOVER Cycle 1 treasury program provide a complete set of deep (~28-30 mag) images in all NIRCam medium- and broad-band filters. This unique dataset allows us to precisely constrain photometric redshifts, map stellar populations and dust attenuation for large samples of distant galaxies, and examine the connection between galaxy structures and formation histories. MegaScience also includes ~17 arcmin^2 of NIRISS parallel imaging in two broad-band and four medium-band filters from 0.9-4.8um, expanding the footprint where robust spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is possible. We provide example SEDs and multi-band cutouts at a variety of redshifts, and use a catalog of JWST spectroscopic redshifts to show that MegaScience improves both the scatter and catastrophic outlier rate of photometric redshifts by factors of 2-3. Additionally, we demonstrate the spatially-resolved science enabled by MegaScience by presenting maps of the [OIII] line emission and continuum emission in three spectroscopically-confirmed z>6 galaxies. We show that line emission in reionization-era galaxies can be clumpy, extended, and spatially offset from continuum emission, implying that galaxy assembly histories are complex even at these early epochs. We publicly release fully reduced mosaics and photometric catalogs for both the NIRCam primary and NIRISS parallel fields. |
