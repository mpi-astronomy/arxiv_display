|**Abstract**| The accuracy of stellar distances inferred purely from parallaxes degrades rapidly with distance. Proper motion measurements, when combined with some idea of typical velocities, provide independent information on stellar distances. Here I build a direction- and distance-dependent model of the distribution of stellar velocities in the Galaxy, then use this together with parallaxes and proper motions to infer kinegeometric distances and transverse velocities for stars in Gaia DR3. Using noisy simulations I assess the performance of the method and compare its accuracy to purely parallax-based (geometric) distances. Over the whole Gaia catalogue, kinegeometric distances are on average 1.25 times more accurate than geometric ones. This average masks a large variation in the relative performance, however. Kinegeometric distances are considerably better than geometric ones beyond several kpc, for example. On average, kinegeometric distances can be measured to an accuracy of 19% and velocities (sqrt[vra^2 + vdec^2]) to 16 km/s (median absolute deviations). In Gaia DR3, kinegeometric distances are smaller than geometric ones on average for distant stars, but the pattern is more complex in the bulge and disk. With the much more accurate proper motions expected in Gaia DR5, a further improvement in the distance accuracy by a factor of (only) 1.35 on average is predicted (with kinegeometric distances still 1.25 times more accurate than geometric ones). The improvement from proper motions is limited by the width of the velocity prior, in a way that the improvement from better parallaxes is not limited by the width of the distance prior. |

|**Abstract**| Large-scale astronomical surveys can capture numerous images of celestial objects, including galaxies and nebulae. Analysing and processing these images can reveal intricate internal structures of these objects, allowing researchers to conduct comprehensive studies on their morphology, evolution, and physical properties. However, varying noise levels and point spread functions can hamper the accuracy and efficiency of information extraction from these images. To mitigate these effects, we propose a novel image restoration algorithm that connects a deep learning-based restoration algorithm with a high-fidelity telescope simulator. During the training stage, the simulator generates images with different levels of blur and noise to train the neural network based on the quality of restored images. After training, the neural network can directly restore images obtained by the telescope, as represented by the simulator. We have tested the algorithm using real and simulated observation data and have found that it effectively enhances fine structures in blurry images and increases the quality of observation images. This algorithm can be applied to large-scale sky survey data, such as data obtained by LSST, Euclid, and CSST, to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of information extraction, promoting advances in the field of astronomical research. |

|**Abstract**| We present a multiwavelength investigation of the hub-filament system RCW 117 (IRAS 17059-4132), which shows intricate filamentary features in the far-infrared, mapped using Herschel images. We obtain the column density and dust temperature maps for the region using the Herschel images, and identify 88 cores and 12 filaments from the column density map of the region ($18'\times18'$). We employ the ThrUMMS $^{13}$CO (J=1-0) data for probing the kinematics in RCW 117, and find velocity gradients ($\sim 0.3-1$ km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$) with hints of matter inflow along the filamentary structures. Ionised gas emission from the associated HII region is examined using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 610 and 1280 MHz, and is found to be of extent $5 \times 3$ pc$^2$ with intensity being brightest towards the hub. We estimate the peak electron density towards the hub to be $\sim 750$ cm$^{-3}$. Thirty four Class 0/I young stellar objects (YSOs) have been identified in the region using the Spitzer GLIMPSE colour-colour diagram, with many lying along the filamentary structures. Based on the (i) presence of filamentary structures, (ii) distribution of cores across the region, with $\sim39$% found along the filamentary structures, (iii) massive star-formation tracers in the hub, and (iv) the kinematics, we believe that global hierarchical collapse can plausibly explain the observed features in RCW 117. |

|**Abstract**| Photonics offer numerous functionalities that can be used to realize astrophotonic instruments. The most spectacular example to date is the ESO Gravity instrument at the Very Large Telescope in Chile. Integrated astrophotonic devices stand to offer critical advantages for instrument development, including extreme miniaturization, as well as integration, superior thermal and mechanical stabilization owing to the small footprint, and high replicability offering cost savings. Numerous astrophotonic technologies have been developed to address shortcomings of conventional instruments to date, including for example the development of photonic lanterns, complex aperiodic fiber Bragg gratings, complex beam combiners to enable long baseline interferometry, and laser frequency combs for high precision spectral calibration of spectrometers. Despite these successes, the facility implementation of photonic solutions in astronomical instrumentation is currently limited because of (1) low throughputs from coupling to fibers, coupling fibers to chips, propagation and bend losses, device losses, etc, (2) difficulties with scaling to large channel count devices needed for large bandwidths and high resolutions, and (3) efficient integration of photonics with detectors, to name a few. In this roadmap, we identify 24 areas that need further development. We outline the challenges and advances needed across those areas covering design tools, simulation capabilities, fabrication processes, the need for entirely new components, integration and hybridization and the characterization of devices. To realize these advances the astrophotonics community will have to work cooperatively with industrial partners who have more advanced manufacturing capabilities. With the advances described herein, multi-functional instruments will be realized leading to novel observing capabilities for both ground and space platforms. |
