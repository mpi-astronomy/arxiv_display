|**Abstract**| We use the TNG50 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project to study cold, dense clouds of gas in the circumgalactic media (CGM) of Milky Way-like galaxies. We find that their CGM is typically filled with of order one hundred (thousand) reasonably (marginally) resolved clouds, possible analogs of high-velocity clouds (HVCs). There is a large variation in cloud abundance from galaxy to galaxy, and the physical properties of clouds that we explore -- mass, size, metallicity, pressure, and kinematics -- are also diverse. We quantify the distributions of cloud properties and cloud-background contrasts, providing cosmological inputs for idealized simulations. Clouds characteristically have sub-solar metallicities, diverse shapes, small overdensities ($\chi = n_{\rm cold} / n_{\rm hot} \lesssim 10$), are mostly inflowing, and have sub-virial rotation. At TNG50 resolution, resolved clouds have median masses of $\sim 10^6\,\rm{M_\odot}$ and sizes of $\sim 10$ kpc. Larger clouds are well converged numerically, while the abundance of the smallest clouds increases with resolution, as expected. In TNG50 MW-like haloes, clouds are slightly (severely) under-pressurised relative to their surroundings with respect to total (thermal) pressure, implying that magnetic fields may be important. Clouds are not distributed uniformly throughout the CGM, but are clustered around other clouds, often near baryon-rich satellite galaxies. This suggests that at least some clouds originate from satellites, via direct ram-pressure stripping or otherwise. Finally, we compare with observations of intermediate and high velocity clouds from the real Milky Way halo. TNG50 shows a similar cloud velocity distribution as observations, and predicts a significant population of currently difficult-to-detect low velocity clouds. |

|**Abstract**| We present the properties of Milky Way- and Andromeda-like (MW/M31-like) galaxies simulated within TNG50, the highest-resolution run of the IllustrisTNG suite of $\Lambda$CDM magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. We introduce our fiducial selection for MW/M31 analogs, which we propose for direct usage as well as for reference in future analyses. TNG50 contains 198 MW/M31 analogs, i.e. galaxies with stellar disky morphology, with a stellar mass in the range of $M_* = 10^{10.5 - 11.2}$ Msun, and within a MW-like Mpc-scale environment at z=0. These are resolved with baryonic (dark matter) mass resolution of $8.5\times10^4$ Msun ($4.5\times10^5$ Msun) and $\sim150$ pc of average spatial resolution in the star-forming regions: we therefore expand by many factors (2 orders of magnitude) the sample size of cosmologically-simulated analogs with similar ($\times 10$ better) numerical resolution. The majority of TNG50 MW/M31 analogs at $z=0$ exhibit a bar, 60 per cent are star-forming, the sample includes 3 Local Group (LG)-like systems, and a number of galaxies host one or more satellites as massive as e.g. the Magellanic Clouds. Even within such a relatively narrow selection, TNG50 reveals a great diversity in galaxy and halo properties, as well as in past histories. Within the TNG50 sample, it is possible to identify several simulated galaxies whose integral and structural properties are consistent, one or more at a time, with those measured for the Galaxy and Andromeda. With this paper, we document and release a series of broadly applicable data products that build upon the IllustrisTNG public release and aim to facilitate easy access and analysis by public users. These include datacubes across snapshots ($0 \le z \le 7$) for each TNG50 MW/M31-like galaxy, and a series of value-added catalogs that will be continually expanded to provide a convenient and up to date community resource. |

|**Abstract**| We use the sample of 198 Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) analogs from TNG50 to quantify the level of disk flaring predicted by a modern, high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. Disk flaring refers to the increase of vertical stellar disk height with galactocentric distance. The TNG50 galaxies are selected to have stellar disky morphology, a stellar mass in the range of $M_* = 10^{10.5 - 11.2}~\rm{M_{\odot}}$, and a MW-like Mpc-scale environment at $z=0$. The stellar disks of such TNG50 MW/M31 analogs exhibit a wide diversity of structural properties, including a number of galaxies with disk scalelength and thin and thick disk scaleheights that are comparable to those measured or inferred for the Galaxy and Andromeda. With one set of physical ingredients, TNG50 returns a large variety of flaring flavours and amounts, also for mono-age stellar populations. With this paper, we hence propose a non-parametric characterization of flaring. The typical MW/M31 analogs exhibit disk scaleheights that are $1.5-2$ times larger in the outer than in the inner regions of the disk for both old and young stellar populations, but with a large galaxy-to-galaxy variation. Which stellar population flares more, and by how much, also varies from galaxy to galaxy. TNG50 de facto brackets existing observational constraints for the Galaxy and all previous numerical findings. A link between the amount of flaring and the $z=0$ global galaxy structural properties or merger history is complex. However, a connection between the scaleheights and the local stellar vertical kinematics and gravitational potential is clearly in place. |

|**Abstract**| The baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), which connects the baryonic mass of galaxies with their circular velocities, has been validated across a wide range of galaxies, from dwarf galaxies to massive galaxies. Recent studies have found that several ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) deviate significantly from the BTFR, indicating a galaxy population with abnormal dynamical properties. However, such studies were still confined within a small sample size. In this study, we used the 100% complete Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFALFA) to investigate the BTFR of 88 HI-rich UDGs (HUDGs), which is the largest UDG sample with dynamical information. We found that the HUDGs form a continuous distribution in the BTFR diagram, with high-velocity galaxies consistent with normal dwarf galaxies at 1 $\sigma$ level, and low-velocity galaxies deviating from the BTFR, in line with that reported in the literature. We point out that the observed deviation may be subject to various selection effects or systemic biases. Nevertheless, we found that the significance of the deviation of HUDGs from the BTFR and TFR are different, i.e., they either deviate from the BTFR or from the TFR. Our result indicates that a high-gas fraction may play an important role in explaining the deviation of HUDGs from BTFR. |

|| Y. Li, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |

|**Abstract**| Fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been found in great numbers but the physical mechanism of these sources is still a mystery. The redshift evolutions of the FRB energy distribution function and the volumetric rate shed light on revealing the origin of the FRBs. However, such estimations rely on the dispersion measurement (DM)-redshift ($z$) relationship. A few of FRBs detected recently show large excess DM beyond the expectation from the cosmological and Milky Way contributions, which indicates large spread of DM from their host galaxies. In this work, we adopt the lognormal distributed $\rm DM_{host}$ model and estimate the energy function using the non-repeating FRBs selected from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)/FRB Catalog 1. By comparing the lognormal distributed $\rm DM_{host}$ model to the constant $\rm DM_{host}$ model, the FRB energy function results are consistent within the measurement uncertainty. We also estimate the volumetric rate of the non-repeating FRBs in three different redshift bins. The volumetric rate shows that the trend is consistent with the stellar-mass density redshift evolution. Since the lognormal distributed $\rm DM_{host}$ model increases the measurement errors, the inference of FRBs tracking the stellar-mass density is nonetheless undermined. |

|**Abstract**| The population of black holes inferred from the detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has revealed interesting features in the properties of black holes in the universe. We analyze the GWTC-3 dataset assuming the detected black holes have both astrophysical and primordial origins. In particular, we consider primordial black holes forming from vacuum bubbles that nucleate during inflation, with their mass distribution described by a broken power law. We find that more than half of the events could come from primordial black hole mergers. Astrophysical black holes are mainly responsible for the peak in mass distribution at $\sim 10M_\odot$ indicated by GWTC-3; whereas primordial black holes are responsible for the massive black holes, as well as the peak at $\sim 30M_\odot$. We also discuss the implications on the primordial black hole formation mechanism and the underlying inflationary model. |

|**Abstract**| We present the discovery of 48 new and the analysis of 55, including 7 previously discovered, dwarf galaxy candidates around the giant spiral galaxy NGC~2997 using deep $BVI$ images from the KMTNet Supernova Program. Their $V$-band central surface brightness and total absolute magnitudes range between 20.3--26.7 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and --(8.02--17.69) mag, respectively, while the $I$-band effective radii are between 0.14 and 2.97 kpc. We obtain $\alpha$ $\simeq$ --1.43 $\pm$ 0.02 for the faint-end slope of their luminosity function, comparable to previously measured values but shallower than theoretical predictions based on $\Lambda$CDM models. The distance-independent distributions of their mass and color from the host galaxy NGC~2997 suggest that the group could be dynamically young, prior to the development of significant mass segregation or radial color gradients. The systematically bluer colors of the brighter candidates than the fainter ones indicate higher star formation activities in brighter members. We suggest that the higher-mass dwarf galaxies in the group have maintained star-formation activities by effectively retaining gas content, while environmental quenching is only effective for the lower-mass galaxies. The interpretation of early evolutionary stage of this group is also consistent with the overall morphological distribution of the dwarf galaxy candidates showing a lack of morphologically evolved candidates but a plethora of irregularly shaped ones. Our detection rate of dwarf galaxy candidates in the NGC~2997 group and their inferred star formation activities are largely comparable to those found in Milky Way analog systems from the SAGA survey within the magnitude limit M$_{V}$ $\lesssim$ --13 mag, as well as those found in the ELVES survey. |

|**Abstract**| NGC 6302 (The ''Butterfly Nebula'') is an extremely energetic bipolar nebula whose central star is among the most massive, hottest, and presumably rapidly evolving of all central stars of planetary nebulae. Our proper-motion study of NGC 6302, based on excellent HST WFC3 images spanning 11 yr, has uncovered at least four different pairs of expanding internal lobes that were ejected at various times over the past two millennia at speeds ranging from 10 to 600 km s^-1. In addition, we find a pair of off-axis flows in constant motion at 760 +/- 100 km s^-1 within which bright [Fe II] feathers are conspicuous. Combining our results with those previously published, we find that the ensemble of flows has an ionized mass > 0.1 M_sun. The kinetic energy of the ensemble, 10^46 - 10^48 ergs, lies at the upper end of gravity-powered processes such as stellar mergers or mass accretion and is too large to be explained by stellar radiation pressure or convective ejections. The structure and dynamics of the Butterfly Nebula suggests that its central engine has had a remarkable history, and the highly unusual patterns of growth within its wings challenge our current understanding of late stellar mass ejection. |
