|**Abstract**| The variations in Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity observed at $z>5.3$ between lines of sight to different background quasars are too strong to be caused by fluctuations in the density field alone. The leading hypothesis for the cause of this excess variance is a late, ongoing reionization process at redshifts below six. Another model proposes strong ionizing background fluctuations coupled to a short, spatially varying mean free path of ionizing photons, without explicitly invoking incomplete reionization. With recent observations suggesting a short mean free path at $z\sim6$, and a dramatic improvement in $z>5$ Ly$\alpha$ forest data quality, we revisit this latter possibility. Here we apply the likelihood-free inference technique of approximate Bayesian computation to jointly constrain the hydrogen photoionization rate $\Gamma_{\rm HI}$ and the mean free path of ionizing photons $\lambda_{\rm mfp}$ from the effective optical depth distributions at $z=5.0$-$6.1$ from XQR-30. We find that the observations are well-described by fluctuating mean free path models with average mean free paths that are consistent with the steep trend implied by independent measurements at $z\sim5$-$6$, with a concomitant rapid evolution of the photoionization rate. |

|**Abstract**| We aim to investigate the origin of the HI Br$\gamma$ emission in young stars by using GRAVITY to image the innermost region of circumstellar disks, where important physical processes such as accretion and winds occur. With high spectral and angular resolution, we focus on studying the continuum and the HI Br$\gamma$-emitting area of the Herbig star HD58647. Using VLTI-GRAVITY, we conducted observations of HD58647 with both high spectral and high angular resolution. Thanks to the extensive $uv$ coverage, we were able to obtain detailed images of the circumstellar environment at a sub-au scale, specifically capturing the continuum and the Br$\gamma$-emitting region. Through the analysis of velocity-dispersed images and photocentre shifts, we were able to investigate the kinematics of the HI Br$\gamma$-emitting region. The recovered continuum images show extended emission where the disk major axis is oriented along a position angle of 14\degr. The size of the continuum emission at 5-sigma levels is $\sim$ 1.5 times more extended than the sizes reported from geometrical fitting (3.69 mas $\pm$ 0.02 mas). This result supports the existence of dust particles close to the stellar surface, screened from the stellar radiation by an optically thick gaseous disk. Moreover, for the first time with GRAVITY, the hot gas component of HD58647 traced by the Br$\gamma$ ,has been imaged. This allowed us to constrain the size of the Br$\gamma$-emitting region and study the kinematics of the hot gas; we find its velocity field to be roughly consistent with gas that obeys Keplerian motion. The velocity-dispersed images show that the size of the hot gas emission is from a more compact region than the continuum (2.3 mas $\pm$ 0.2 mas). Finally, the line phases show that the emission is not entirely consistent with Keplerian rotation, hinting at a more complex structure in the hot gaseous disk. |

|**Abstract**| We present a new method for modelling the kinematics of galaxies from interferometric observations by performing the optimization of the kinematic model parameters directly in visibility-space instead of the conventional approach of fitting velocity fields produced with the CLEAN algorithm in real-space. We demonstrate our method on ALMA observations of $^{12}$CO (2$-$1), (3$-$2) or (4$-$3) emission lines from an initial sample of 30 massive 850$\mu$m-selected dusty star-forming galaxies with far-infrared luminosities $\gtrsim$$\,10^{12}\,$L$_{\odot}$ in the redshift range $z \sim\,$1.2$-$4.7. Using the results from our modelling analysis for the 12 sources with the highest signal-to-noise emission lines and disk-like kinematics, we conclude the following: (i) Our sample prefers a CO-to-$H_2$ conversion factor, of $\alpha_{\rm CO} = 0.92 \pm 0.36$; (ii) These far-infrared luminous galaxies follow a similar Tully$-$Fisher relation between the circularized velocity, $V_{\rm circ}$, and baryonic mass, $M_{\rm b}$, as more typical star-forming samples at high redshift, but extend this relation to much higher masses $-$ showing that these are some of the most massive disk-like galaxies in the Universe; (iii) Finally, we demonstrate support for an evolutionary link between massive high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies and the formation of local early-type galaxies using the both the distributions of the baryonic and kinematic masses of these two populations on the $M_{\rm b}\,-\,\sigma$ plane and their relative space densities. |

|**Abstract**| In the hunt for Earth-like exoplanets it is crucial to have reliable host star parameters, as they have a direct impact on the accuracy and precision of the inferred parameters for any discovered exoplanet. For stars with masses between 0.35 and 0.5 ${\rm M_{\odot}}$ an unexplained radius inflation is observed relative to typical stellar models. However, for fully convective objects with a mass below 0.35 ${\rm M_{\odot}}$ it is not known whether this radius inflation is present as there are fewer objects with accurate measurements in this regime. Low-mass eclipsing binaries present a unique opportunity to determine empirical masses and radii for these low-mass stars. Here we report on such a star, EBLM J2114-39\,B. We have used HARPS and FEROS radial-velocities and TESS photometry to perform a joint fit of the data, and produce one of the most precise estimates of a very low mass star's parameters. Using a precise and accurate radius for the primary star using Gaia DR3 data, we determine J2114-39 to be a $M_1 = 0.987 \pm 0.059$ ${\rm M_{\odot}}$ primary star hosting a fully convective secondary with mass $M_2~=~0.0986~\pm 0.0038~\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, which lies in a poorly populated region of parameter space. With a radius $R_2 =~0.1275~\pm0.0020~\,\mathrm{R_{\odot}}$, similar to TRAPPIST-1, we see no significant evidence of radius inflation in this system when compared to stellar evolution models. We speculate that stellar models in the regime where radius inflation is observed might be affected by how convective overshooting is treated. |

|**Abstract**| The gravitational microlensing technique is most sensitive to planets in a Jupiter-like orbit and has detected more than 200 planets. However, only a few wide-orbit ($s > 2$) microlensing planets have been discovered, where $s$ is the planet-to-host separation normalized to the angular Einstein ring radius, $\theta_{\rm E}$. Here we present the discovery and analysis of a strong candidate wide-orbit microlensing planet in the event, OGLE-2017-BLG-0448. The whole light curve exhibits long-term residuals to the static binary-lens single-source model, so we investigate the residuals by adding the microlensing parallax, microlensing xallarap, an additional lens, or an additional source. For the first time, we observe a complex degeneracy between all four effects. The wide-orbit models with $s \sim 2.5$ and a planet-to-host mass-ratio of $q \sim 10^{-4}$ are significantly preferred, but we cannot rule out the close models with $s \sim 0.35$ and $q \sim 10^{-3}$. A Bayesian analysis based on a Galactic model indicates that, despite the complicated degeneracy, the surviving wide-orbit models all contain a super-Earth-mass to Neptune-mass planet at a projected planet-host separation of $\sim 6$ au and the surviving close-orbit models all consist of a Jovian-mass planet at $\sim 1$ au. The host star is probably an M or K dwarf. We discuss the implications of this dimension-degeneracy disaster on microlensing light-curve analysis and its potential impact on statistical studies. |
