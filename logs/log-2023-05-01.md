|**Abstract**| High-mass stars are thought to accumulate much of their mass via short, infrequent bursts of disk-aided accretion. Such accretion events are rare and difficult to observe directly but are known to drive enhanced maser emission. In this Letter we report high-resolution, multi-epoch methanol maser observations toward G358.93-0.03 which reveal an interesting phenomenon; the sub-luminal propagation of a thermal radiation "heat-wave" emanating from an accreting high-mass proto-star. The extreme transformation of the maser emission implies a sudden intensification of thermal infrared radiation from within the inner (40 mas, 270 au) region. Subsequently, methanol masers trace the radial passage of thermal radiation through the environment at $\geq$ 4-8\% the speed of light. Such a high translocation rate contrasts with the $\leq$ 10 km s$^{-1}$ physical gas motions of methanol masers typically observed using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). The observed scenario can readily be attributed to an accretion event in the high-mass proto-star G358.93-0.03-MM1. While being the third case in its class, G358.93-0.03-MM1 exhibits unique attributes hinting at a possible `zoo' of accretion burst types. These results promote the advantages of maser observations in understanding high-mass star formation, both through single-dish maser monitoring campaigns and via their international cooperation as VLBI arrays. |

|**Abstract**| High-mass protostars (M$_{\star} >$ 8 M$_{\odot}$) are thought to gain the majority of their mass via short, intense bursts of growth. This episodic accretion is thought to be facilitated by gravitationally unstable and subsequently inhomogeneous accretion disks. Limitations of observational capabilities, paired with a lack of observed accretion burst events has withheld affirmative confirmation of the association between disk accretion, instability and the accretion burst phenomenon in high-mass protostars. Following its 2019 accretion burst, a heat-wave driven by a burst of radiation propagated outward from the high-mass protostar G358.93-0.03-MM1. Six VLBI (very long baseline interferometry) observations of the raditively pumped 6.7 GHz methanol maser were conducted during this period, tracing ever increasing disk radii as the heat-wave propagated outward. Concatenating the VLBI maps provided a sparsely sampled, milliarcsecond view of the spatio-kinematics of the accretion disk covering a physical range of $\sim$ 50 - 900 AU. We term this observational approach `heat-wave mapping'. We report the discovery of a Keplerian accretion disk with a spatially resolved four-arm spiral pattern around G358.93-0.03-MM1. This result positively implicates disk accretion and spiral arm instabilities into the episodic accretion high-mass star formation paradigm. |
