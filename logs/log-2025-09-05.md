|**Abstract**|            We aim to study the clustering of metal absorption lines and the structures that they arise in as a function of cosmic time. We focus on C IV and Si IV absorption features that are identified along a given quasar sightline. We exploit the two-point correlation function (2PCF) to investigate the clustering of these structures as a function of their separation. We utilise the E-XQR-30 data to perform a novel analysis at z>5. We also draw on literature surveys (including XQ-100) of lower redshift quasars to investigate the possible evolution of this clustering towards cosmic noon (i.e., z~2-3). We find no significant evolution with redshift when considering the separation of absorbers in velocity space. Since we are comparing data across a large interval of cosmic time, we also consider the separation between absorbers in the reference frame of physical distances. In this reference frame, we find that the amplitude of the clustering increases with cosmic time for both C IV and Si IV on the scales of <1500 physical kpc. For the first time, we assess the 2PCF of C IV and Si IV close to the epoch of reionisation utilising the absorber catalogue from the E-XQR-30 survey. We compare this with lower redshift data and find that, on small scales, the clustering of these structures grows with cosmic time. We compare these results to the clustering of galaxies in the GAEA simulations. It appears that the structures traced by C IV are broadly comparable to the galaxies from the considered simulations. The clustering is most similar to that of the galaxies with virial masses M~10^10.5 M_sun. We require tailor-made simulations to investigate the full range of factors contributing to the observed clustering. Future ground-based spectrographs will further facilitate surveys of absorbers at this epoch with increased sensitivity.         |

|**Abstract**|            To support the selection of large optical/infrared telescope sites in western China, long-term monitoring of atmospheric conditions and astronomical seeing has been conducted at the Muztagh-Ata site on the Pamir Plateau since 2017. With the monitoring focus gradually shifting northward, three stations were established: the South Point, North-1 point, and North-2 point. The North-1 point,selected as the site for the 1.93m Muztagh Optical Survey Telescope (MOST), has recorded seeing and meteorological parameters since late 2018. In 2023,the North-2 point was established approximately 1.5 km northeast of North-1 point as a candidate location for a future large-aperture telescope. A 10m DIMM tower and a PC-4A environmental monitoring system were installed to evaluate site quality. This study presents a comparative analysis of data from the North-1 and North-2 points during this http URL median seeing is 0.89 arcsecs at North-1 and 0.78 arcsecs at North-2. Both points show clear seasonal and diurnal variations,with winter nights offering optimal observing this http URL average, about 64% of the nighttime duration per year is suitable for astronomical observations. Nighttime temperature variation is low :2.03 at North-1 and 2.10 at North-2 .Median wind speeds are 5-6 m/s, with dominant directions between 210 and 300, contributing to stable airflow. Moderate wind suppresses turbulence, while strong shear and rapid fluctuations degrade image quality. These findings confirm that both the North-1 and North-2 points offer high-quality atmospheric conditions and serve as promising sites for future ground-based optical/infrared telescopes in western China.         |

|| Y. G. M. Chew, et al. -- incl., <mark>F. Walter</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            We present the discovery of the eclipsing binary MML 48, which is a member of Upper Centaurus Lupus, has an associated age of 16 Myr, and is composed of two young, low-mass stars. We used space- and ground-based observations to characterize the system with both time-series photometry and spectroscopy. Given the extreme mass ratio between the stars, q_EB = 0.209 +- 0.014, we modeled a single-lined spectroscopic and eclipsing binary system. The orbital period, 2.0171068 +- 0.0000004 d, is measured from the highest precision light curves. We derive a primary mass of 1.2 +- 0.07 Msun using stellar models, and with radial velocities we measured a secondary mass of 0.2509 +- 0.0078 Msun. The radii are large, as expected for pre-main-sequence stars, and are measured as 1.574 +- 0.026 +- 0.050 Rsun and 0.587 +- 0.0095 +- 0.050 Rsun, for the primary and secondary stars, respectively. MML 48 joins the short list of known low-mass, pre-main-sequence eclipsing binaries (EBs), being one of only five systems with intermediate ages (15-25 Myr), and the system with the most extreme mass ratio. The primary star is currently at the "fusion bump", undergoing an over-production of energy in the core due to the build-up of 3He before reaching its equilibrium abundance set by the proton-proton (p-p) I chain. MML 48 A is the first young star in an eclipsing system that has been found during its fusion bump. MML 48 is thus an important benchmark for low-mass stellar evolution at a time when the stars are rapidly changing, which allows for a tight constraint on the corresponding isochrone given the uneven mass ratio.         |
