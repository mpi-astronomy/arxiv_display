|**Abstract**|            We present a sample of six F200W and three F277W dropout sources identified as $16<z<25$ galaxy candidates based on the deepest JWST/NIRCam data to date, provided by the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) and the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public survey (NGDEEP), reaching 5$\sigma$ depths of $\sim31.5$ mag (AB) at $\geq2$ $\mu$m. We estimate ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions and densities at $z\sim17$ and $z\sim25$. We find that the number density of galaxies with absolute magnitudes $-19<M_\mathrm{UV}<-18$ (AB) at $z\sim17$ ($z\sim25$) is a factor of 4 (25) smaller than at $z\sim12$; a similar evolution is observed for the luminosity density. Compared to state-of-the-art galaxy simulations, we find the need for an enhanced UV-photon production at $z=17-25$ in $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{DM}=10^{8.5-9.5}$ M$_\odot$ dark matter halos, maybe provided by an increase in the star formation efficiency at early times and/or by intense bursts fed by very low metallicity or primordial gas. There are few robust theoretical predictions for the evolution of galaxies above $z\sim20$ in the literature, however, the continuing rapid drop in the halo mass function suggests more rapid evolution than we observe if photon production efficiencies remained constant. Our $z>16$ galaxy candidates present mass-weighted ages around 30 Myr, and attenuations $\mathrm{A(V)}<0.1$ mag. Their average stellar mass is $\mathrm{M}_\bigstar\sim10^{7}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, implying a star formation efficiency (stellar-to-baryon mass fraction) around 10%. We find three galaxies with very blue UV spectral slopes ($\beta\sim-3$) compatible with low metallicity or Pop III and young ($\lesssim10$ Myr) stars and/or high escape fractions of ionizing photons, the rest presenting slopes $\beta\sim-2.5$ similar to $z=10-12$ samples.         |

|**Abstract**|            The European Space Agency's Euclid mission will observe approximately 14,000 $\rm{deg}^{2}$ of the extragalactic sky and deliver high-quality imaging for many galaxies. The depth and high spatial resolution of the data will enable a detailed analysis of stellar population properties of local galaxies. In this study, we test our pipeline for spatially resolved SED fitting using synthetic images of Euclid, LSST, and GALEX generated from the TNG50 simulation. We apply our pipeline to 25 local simulated galaxies to recover their resolved stellar population properties. We produce 3 types of data cubes: GALEX + LSST + Euclid, LSST + Euclid, and Euclid-only. We perform the SED fitting tests with two SPS models in a Bayesian framework. Because the age, metallicity, and dust attenuation estimates are biased when applying only classical formulations of flat priors, we examine the effects of additional priors in the forms of mass-age-$Z$ relations, constructed using a combination of empirical and simulated data. Stellar-mass surface densities can be recovered well using any of the 3 data cubes, regardless of the SPS model and prior variations. The new priors then significantly improve the measurements of mass-weighted age and $Z$ compared to results obtained without priors, but they may play an excessive role compared to the data in determining the outcome when no UV data is available. The spatially resolved SED fitting method is powerful for mapping the stellar populations of galaxies with the current abundance of high-quality imaging data. Our study re-emphasizes the gain added by including multiwavelength data from ancillary surveys and the roles of priors in Bayesian SED fitting. With the Euclid data alone, we will be able to generate complete and deep stellar mass maps of galaxies in the local Universe, thus exploiting the telescope's wide field, NIR sensitivity, and high spatial resolution.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present an analysis of globular clusters (GCs) of dwarf galaxies in the Perseus galaxy cluster to explore the relationship between dwarf galaxy properties and their GCs. Our focus is on GC numbers ($N_{\rm GC}$) and GC half-number radii ($R_{\rm GC}$) around dwarf galaxies, and their relations with host galaxy stellar masses ($M_*$), central surface brightnesses ($\mu_0$), and effective radii ($R_{\rm e}$). Interestingly, we find that at a given stellar mass, $R_{\rm GC}$ is almost independent of the host galaxy $\mu_0$ and $R_{\rm e}$, while $R_{\rm GC}/R_{\rm e}$ depends on $\mu_0$ and $R_{\rm e}$; lower surface brightness and diffuse dwarf galaxies show $R_{\rm GC}/R_{\rm e}\approx 1$ while higher surface brightness and compact dwarf galaxies show $R_{\rm GC}/R_{\rm e}\approx 1.5$-$2$. This means that for dwarf galaxies of similar stellar mass, the GCs have a similar median extent; however, their distribution is different from the field stars of their host. Additionally, low surface brightness and diffuse dwarf galaxies on average have a higher $N_{\rm GC}$ than high surface brightness and compact dwarf galaxies at any given stellar mass. We also find that UDGs (ultra-diffuse galaxies) and non-UDGs have similar $R_{\rm GC}$, while UDGs have smaller $R_{\rm GC}/R_{\rm e}$ (typically less than 1) and 3-4 times higher $N_{\rm GC}$ than non-UDGs. Examining nucleated and not-nucleated dwarf galaxies, we find that for $M_*>10^8M_{\odot}$, nucleated dwarf galaxies seem to have smaller $R_{\rm GC}$ and $R_{\rm GC}/R_{\rm e}$, with no significant differences between their $N_{\rm GC}$, except at $M_*<10^8M_{\odot}$ where the nucleated dwarf galaxies tend to have a higher $N_{\rm GC}$. Lastly, we explore the stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR) of dwarf galaxies and conclude that the Perseus cluster dwarf galaxies follow the expected SHMR at $z=0$ extrapolated down to $M_*=10^6M_{\odot}$.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report the spatial distribution and physical characteristics of molecular clouds in the G24 region, which is located near the intersection of the Milky Way's Galactic bar with the Norma arm and the 3 kpc arm. Utilizing molecular line data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project, including $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O, along with our own observations of HCO$^{+}$ line using the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO) 13.7 m telescope, we have revealed the complex architecture of molecular clouds in the G24 region. Seven giant molecular clouds, each with a mass exceeding $10^4$ $M_\odot$ and a typical H$_2$ column density of $10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, have been identified through observations of CO and its isotopes. The conversion factor $X_{\text{CO}}$ for the G24 region is estimated to be 8.25 $\times$ 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$, aligning with the typical values observed in other regions. Adopting the GaussClumps algorithm, we have identified a total of 257, 201, and 110 clumps in $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O within G24 region, respectively. The derived physical properties (including effective radius, mass, and virial parameter) indicate that the majority of these clumps are gravitationally bound, with a subset possessing the potential to form massive stars. Examination of gas infall activities within these clumps further suggests ongoing massive star formation. The complex physical and kinematic environment, shaped by the G24 region's unique location within the Milky Way, has limited the clear detection of gas outflows.         |

|**Abstract**|            The existence of the binary system SDSS J1257+5428 has been described as paradoxical. Here we investigate under which conditions SDSS J1257+5428 could be understood as a descendant of a cataclysmic variable with an evolved donor star, which is a scenario that has never been explored in detail. We used the BSE code for pre-common-envelope (CE) evolution and the MESA code for post-CE evolution to run binary evolution simulations and searched for potential formation pathways for SDSS J1257+5428 that lead to its observed characteristics. For the post-CE evolution, we adopted a boosted version of the CARB model. We find that SDSS J1257+5428 can be explained as a post-cataclysmic-variable system if (i) the progenitor of the extremely low-mass WD was initially a solar-type star that evolved into a subgiant before the onset of mass transfer and underwent hydrogen shell flashes after the mass transfer stopped, (ii) the massive WD was highly or entirely rejuvenated during the cataclysmic variable evolution, and (iii) magnetic braking was strong enough to make the evolution convergent. In this case, the torques due to magnetic braking need to be stronger than those provided by the CARB model by a factor of ${\sim100}$. We conclude that SDSS J1257+5428 can be reasonably well explained as having originated from a cataclysmic variable that hosted an evolved donor star and should no longer be regarded as paradoxical. If our formation channel is correct, our findings provide further support that stronger magnetic braking acts on progenitors of (i) close detached WD binaries, (ii) close detached millisecond pulsar with extremely low-mass WDs, (iii) AM CVn binaries, and (iv) ultra-compact X-ray binaries, in comparison to the magnetic braking strength required to explain binaries hosting main-sequence stars and single main-sequence stars.         |
