|**Abstract**|            Dust traps are the most promising mechanisms to explain the observed substructures in protoplanetary discs. In this work, we present high-angular resolution ($\sim$60 mas, 9.4\,au) and high-sensitivity Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) observations at 3 mm of the transitional disc around LkCa15. The new data, combined with previous high-resolution observations at $\lambda=0.87,1.3$ mm, make LkCa15 an ideal laboratory for testing the dust trapping mechanism. We found that the width of the three rings decreases linearly with frequency, and the spectral indices show local minima at the locations of the rings, consistent with dust trap models. Multi-wavelength modelling confirms that the dust surface density and maximum grain size peak at 69 and 101\,au, and suggestive peak at 42\,au. The estimated total dust mass is between 13-250 M$_{\oplus}$, depending on the chosen opacity. The inner disc shows bright and unresolved emission at 3 mm, exhibiting a spectral index of $\alpha_{1.3-3 \rm mm} = 0.3 \pm 0.37$, and $\alpha_{\rm 3mm-3cm}$ ranging from $-0.1$ to $0.0$. These properties are consistent with free-free emission from an ionised jet or disc wind. Dust evolution models and radiative transfer calculations suggest that a viscosity coefficient of $\alpha = 10^{-3}$, a fragmentation velocity of 10 m\,s$^{-1}$, and DSHARP opacities provide the best match to the observed properties.         |

|**Abstract**|            We use the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) observations of the edge-on galaxy UGCA 250, taken as part of the MeerKAT HI Observations of Nearby Galactic Objects - Observing Southern Emitters (MHONGOOSE) survey to investigate the amount, morphology, and kinematics of extraplanar gas. The combination of high column density sensitivity and high spatial resolution of the survey over a large field of view is ideal for studying the underlying physics governing the extraplanar gas. These data reveal 9 additional detections within the field of view along with UGCA 250, with 8 of them being within $\sim$ 200 km s$^{-1}$ of the galaxy's systemic velocity. The galaxy seems to have a tail-like feature extending away from it in the southern direction up to $\sim$ 41 kpc (in projection). We also detect a cloud at anomalous velocities, but we did not find any optical counterpart. We construct a detailed tilted ring model for this edge-on galaxy to gain a deeper understanding of the vertical structure of its neutral hydrogen. The model that best matches the data features a thick disc with a scale height of $\sim$ 3$\pm$1 kpc and an HI mass of about 15$\%$ of the total HI mass. This extraplanar gas is detected for the first time in UGCA 250. Our analysis favours a mixed origin for the extraplanar gas in UGCA 250, likely arising from a combination of internal stellar feedback and external tidal interactions.         |

|**Abstract**|            By analyzing the data from Insight-HXMT and NICER, we can determine the evolution of the significance of the hard shortage in 4U 1636--536 with its spectral state, as well as the evolution of the fraction of deficit with energy. Additionally, we investigate the possible geometry and evolution of the corona in 4U 1636-536 by combining our findings with the results of spectral analysis. We find that during the soft state, the significance of possible hard X-ray shortage in bursts is almost zero. However, in the hard state, some bursts exhibit significant shortages (>3 $\sigma$), while others do not. We attempt to establish a correlation between the significance of the hard X-ray shortage and the spectral parameters, but the data quality and the limited number of bursts prevent us from finding a strong correlation. For bursts with insignificant shortages in the soft state, their fraction of the deficit remains small. However, in the hard state, the fraction of deficit for all bursts increases with energy, regardless of the significance of the shortage of individual bursts. For bursts during the hard state, we investigate the evolution of the fraction of deficit during the bursts by stacking the peaks and decays of the bursts, respectively, and find that as the flux of the bursts decreases, the energy corresponding to the maximum of the fraction of deficit becomes progressively higher. We explore the possible geometry and evolution of the corona clued by the evolution of the fraction of deficit, which is obtained from the spectral and temporal analysis.         |

|**Abstract**|            The systematic properties are largely unknown for the black hole X-ray binary Swift J151857.0--572147 newly discovered in the 2024 outburst. The nature of a black hole can be completely defined by specifying the mass and dimensionless spin parameter. Therefore, accurate measurement of the two fundamental parameters is important for understanding the nature of black holes. The joint spectral fitting of a reflection component with simultaneous observations from Insight-HXMT, NICER and NuSTAR reveals for the first time a black hole dimensionless spin of $0.84^{+0.17}_{-0.26}$ and an inclination angle of $21.1^{+4.5}_{-3.6}$ degree for this system. Monitoring of the soft state by NICER results in disk flux and temperature following $F_{\rm disk} \propto T_{\rm in}^{3.83\pm 0.17}$. For the standard thin disk, $L_{\rm disk}\approx 4\pi R_{\rm in}^{2}\sigma T_{\rm in}^{4}$, so the relationship between the flux and temperature of the disk we measured indicates that the inner radius of the disk is stable and the disk is in the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit. With an empirical relation built previously between the black hole outburst profile and the intrinsic power output, the source distance is estimated as $5.8\pm 2.5$ kpc according to the outburst profile and peak flux observed by Insight-HXMT and NICER. Finally, a black hole mass of $3.67\pm1.79-8.07\pm 4.20 M_\odot$ can be inferred from a joint diagnostic of the aforementioned parameters measured for this system. This system is also consistent with most black hole X-ray binaries with high spin and a mass in the range of 5--20 $M_\odot$         |

|**Abstract**|            We study the spectral properties of the black hole X-ray transient binary 4U 1630--472 during the 2022 and 2023 outbursts with Insight-HXMT observations. We find that the outbursts are in peculiar soft states. The effect of the hardening factor on the disk temperature is taken into account by kerrbb, and the flux and temperature of the disk are found to follow $F \propto T_{\rm eff}^{3.92\pm 0.13}$ and $F \propto T_{\rm eff}^{4.91\pm 1.00}$, for the two outbursts respectively. The flux-temperature relation is roughly consistent with holding a standard disk, By fitting with the p-free model, the p-value is found to have anti-correlation with disk temperature. Combined a joint diagnostic in a diagram of the relation between the non-thermal fraction and luminosity, by enclosing as well the previous outbursts, reveals a possible pattern for the disk evolution toward a slim one, and such an evolution may depend on the fraction of the non-thermal emission in the high soft state.         |

|*Comments*| *10 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            In this paper, we present the linear decomposition method (LDM), which we developed to detect and analyze pulsar profile variations and mode changing behaviour. We developed LDM utilizing the likelihood function approach assuming the Gaussian noise. The LDM projects pulse profiles onto significance-ordered orthonormal vector bases. We show that the method is similar to the principal component analysis (PCA), but LDM can handle more general situations. We use simulated dataset and data from the Kunming 40-m radio telescope to demonstrate the application of the LDM. We found that the LDM successfully identified mode changes for well-known mode-changing PSR B0329+54 and found a continuous pulse profile evolution for PSR B0355+54 . We also show that the LDM can be used to improve the timing precision for mode changing PSR B0329+54.         |

|| D. Belfiori, et al. -- incl., <mark>A. Hughes</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            Magnetic fields have an impact on galaxy evolution at multiple scales. They are particularly important for starburst galaxies, where they play a crucial role in shaping the interstellar medium (ISM), influencing star formation processes and interacting with galactic outflows. The primary aim of this study is to obtain a parsec scale map of dust polarisation and B-field structure within the central starburst region of NGC253. This includes examining the relationship between the morphology of B-fields, galactic outflows and the spatial distribution of super star clusters (SSC), to understand their combined effects on the galaxy's star formation and ISM. We used ALMA full polarisation data in Bands 4 (145 GHz) and 7 (345 GHz) with resolution of 25 and 5 pc scale, respectively. According to our SED fitting analysis, the observed Band 4 emission is a combination of dust, synchrotron and free-free, while Band 7 traces only dust. The polarisation fraction (PF) of the synchrotron component is 2%, while that of the dust component is 0.3%. The B-fields orientation maps in both bands at common resolution show that the same B-fields structure is traced by dust and synchrotron emission at scales of 25 pc. The B-field morphology suggests a coupling with the multiphase outflow, while the distribution of PF in Band 7 showed to be correlated with the presence of SSC. We observed a significant anti-correlation between polarisation fraction and column density in both Bands 4 and 7. A negative correlation between PF and dispersion angle function was observed in Band 4 but was nearly absent in Band 7 at native resolution, suggesting that the tangling of B-field geometry along the plane of the sky is the main cause of depolarisation at 25 pc scales, while other factors play a role at 5 pc scales.         |

|**Abstract**|            Phosphorus plays an essential role in the chemistry of living organisms, being present in several fundamental biomolecules. The investigation of chemical reactions taking place in different astronomical environments involving phosphorus-containing molecules is essential for understanding how these species are produced and destroyed. Phosphorus monoxide (PO) and phosphorus nitride (PN) are key reservoirs of phosphorus in the Interstellar Medium (ISM). This work presents a computational study of the CPN system to identify viable reaction pathways involving atom-diatom collisions and to explore a potential destruction route for PN in the ISM. We explore the potential energy landscape of the C($\mathrm{^3P}$) + PN($^1\Sigma^+$), N($\mathrm{^4S}$) + CP($^2\Sigma^+$) and P($\mathrm{^4S}$) + CN($^2\Sigma^+$) reactions by performing high-accuracy ab initio calculations and provide their rate coefficients over a wide range of temperatures. The temperature-dependent rate coefficients were fitted to the modified Arrhenius equation: $k(T)=\alpha(T/300)^{\beta}\mathrm{exp}(-\gamma/T)$. An updated chemical network for P-bearing species was used to model the time-dependent abundances and reaction contributions of P, PO, PN, and PH during the chemical evolution of diffuse/translucent and dense clouds. The only neutral-neutral reaction capable of destroying PN without an activation energy seems to be the PN+C one. We have also shown that reactions between CP and N can yield CN and PN barrierless. Chemical models indicate that PO is a crucial species driving the gas-phase formation of PN. Typically, PO/PN ratios exceed 1, though their chemistry is influenced by photon- and cosmic-ray-induced processes. Over time in simulated dense clouds, neutral-neutral reactions such as PO + N, PH + N, P + OH, and PH + O play a significant role in determining the relative abundances of PO and PN.         |

|| R. Anna-Thomas, et al. -- incl., <mark>F. Walter</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-03-06*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted to ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients that serve as unique probes of extragalactic matter. We report on the discovery and localization of two FRBs piercing the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) by the realfast fast transient detection system at the Very Large Array. Their unique sightlines allow constraints on M31's electron density distribution. We localized FRB 20230903A to its host galaxy at a redshift $z=0.09$ and FRB 20230506C to a host galaxy at a redshift $z=0.39$. After accounting for the dispersion contribution from the Milky Way, the host galaxy and the intergalactic medium along the line of sight of the FRBs, we estimate that M31 alone will likely contribute between 21-217 $\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ along FRB 20230903A and between 43-338 $\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ along FRB 20230506C with a 90% confidence. We also modeled the M31 disk's contribution to the DM to determine the halo contribution. We find that the halo of M31 will contribute between 9-145 $\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ along FRB 20230903A and between 28-286 $\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ along FRB 20230506C with 90% confidence. The measured values of $\rm DM_{M31,halo}$ are consistent with the predictions from the modified Navarro-Frenk-White profile of M31's halo for a given impact parameter. The ions of the cool halo alone cannot account for the calculated $\rm DM_{M31,halo}$ and therefore this measurement presents indirect evidence of the hot halo of M31. We also suggest a possible intersection of the line of sight of FRB 20230506C with a hot baryon bridge between M31 and the Milky Way         |
