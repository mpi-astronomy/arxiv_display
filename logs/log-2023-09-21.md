|**Abstract**| Recent work on the characterization of small exoplanets has allowed us to accumulate growing evidence that the sub-Neptunes with radii greater than $\sim2.5\,R_\oplus$ often host H$_2$/He-dominated atmospheres both from measurements of their low bulk densities and direct detections of their low mean-molecular-mass atmospheres. However, the smaller sub-Neptunes in the 1.5-2.2 R$_\oplus$ size regime are much less understood, and often have bulk densities that can be explained either by the H$_2$/He-rich scenario, or by a volatile-dominated composition known as the "water world" scenario. Here, we report the detection of water vapor in the transmission spectrum of the $1.96\pm0.08$ R$_\oplus$ sub-Neptune GJ9827d obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. We observed 11 HST/WFC3 transits of GJ9827d and find an absorption feature at 1.4$\mu$m in its transit spectrum, which is best explained (at 3.39$\sigma$) by the presence of water in GJ9827d's atmosphere. We further show that this feature cannot be caused by unnoculted star spots during the transits by combining an analysis of the K2 photometry and transit light-source effect retrievals. We reveal that the water absorption feature can be similarly well explained by a small amount of water vapor in a cloudy H$_2$/He atmosphere, or by a water vapor envelope on GJ9827d. Given that recent studies have inferred an important mass-loss rate ($>0.5\,$M$_\oplus$/Gyr) for GJ9827d making it unlikely to retain a H-dominated envelope, our findings highlight GJ9827d as a promising water world candidate that could host a volatile-dominated atmosphere. This water detection also makes GJ9827d the smallest exoplanet with an atmospheric molecular detection to date. |

|**Abstract**| We report the serendipitous discovery of a giant mid-infrared (MIR) outburst from a previously unknown source near a star-forming region in the constellation Monoceros. The source gradually brightened by a factor of 5 from 2014 to 2016 before an abrupt rise by a factor of more than 100 in 2017. A total amplitude increase of >500 at 4.5 microns has since faded by a factor of about 10. Prior to the outburst, it was only detected at wavelengths longer than 1.8 microns in UKIDSS, Spitzer, and Herschel with a spectral energy distribution of a Class I Young Stellar Object (YSO). It has not been detected in recent optical surveys, suggesting that it is deeply embedded. With a minimum distance of 3.5 kpc, the source has a bolometric luminosity of at least 9 $L_\odot$ in the quiescent state and 400 $L_\odot$ at the peak of the eruption. The maximum accretion rate is estimated to be at least a few $10^{-5}$ $M_\odot$ year$^{-1}$. It shares several common properties with another eruptive event, WISE~J142238.82-611553.7: exceptionally large amplitude, featureless near-infrared spectrum with the exception of H_2 lines, intermediate eruption duration, an embedded Class I YSO, and a low radiative temperature (<600-700 K) in outburst. We interpret that the radiation from the inner accretion disk and young star is obscured and reprocessed by either an inflated outer disk or thick dusty outflow on scales > 6.5 AU during the outburst. |

|| Z. Zhang, et al. -- incl., <mark>S. Li</mark> |

|**Abstract**| In this work, we investigate the optimal map-making technique for the linear system $\bm{d}=\bm{A}\bm{x}+\bm{n}$ while carefully taking into account singularities that may come from either the covariance matrix $\bm{C} = \<\bm{n}\bm{n}^t\>$ or the main matrix $\bm{A}$. We first describe the general optimal solution, which is quite complex, and then use the modified pseudo inverse to create a near-optimal solution, which is simple, robust, and can significantly alleviate the unwanted noise amplification during map-making. The effectiveness of the nearly optimal solution is then compared to that of the naive co-adding solution and the standard pseudo inverse solution, showing noticeable improvements. Interestingly, all one needs to get the near-optimal solution with singularity is just a tiny change to the traditional optimal solution that is designed for the case without singularity. |
