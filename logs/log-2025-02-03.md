|**Abstract**|            We present observations of the Type IIP supernova (SN) 2024jlf, including spectroscopy beginning just 0.7 days ($\sim$17 hours) after first light. Rapid follow-up was enabled by the new $\texttt{BTSbot-nearby}$ program, which involves autonomously triggering target-of-opportunity requests for new transients in Zwicky Transient Facility data that are coincident with nearby ($D<60$ Mpc) galaxies and identified by the $\texttt{BTSbot}$ machine learning model. Early photometry and non-detections shortly prior to first light show that SN 2024jlf initially brightened by $>$4 mag/day, quicker than $\sim$90% of Type II SNe. Early spectra reveal weak flash ionization features: narrow, short-lived ($1.3 < \tau ~\mathrm{[d]} < 1.8$) emission lines of H$\alpha$, He II, and C IV. Assuming a wind velocity of $v_w=50$ km s$^{-1}$, these properties indicate that the red supergiant progenitor exhibited enhanced mass-loss in the last year before explosion. We constrain the mass-loss rate to $10^{-4} < \dot{M}~\mathrm{[M_\odot~yr^{-1}]} < 10^{-3}$ by matching observations to model grids from two independent radiative hydrodynamics codes. $\texttt{BTSbot-nearby}$ automation minimizes spectroscopic follow-up latency, enabling the observation of ephemeral early-time phenomena exhibited by transients.         |
