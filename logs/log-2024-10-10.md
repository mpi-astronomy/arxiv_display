|**Abstract**|            Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) plays a critical role in shaping the matter distribution on scales comparable to and larger than individual galaxies. Upcoming surveys such as $\textit{Euclid}$ and LSST aim to precisely quantify the matter distribution on cosmological scales, making a detailed understanding of AGN feedback effects essential. Hydrodynamical simulations provide an informative framework for studying these effects, in particular by allowing us to vary the parameters that determine the strength of these feedback processes and, consequently, to predict their corresponding impact on the large-scale matter distribution. We use the EAGLE simulations to explore how changes in subgrid viscosity and AGN heating temperature affect the matter distribution, quantified via 2- and 3-point correlation functions, as well as higher order cumulants of the matter distribution. We find that varying viscosity has a small impact ($\approx 10\%$) on scales larger than $1 h^{-1}$ Mpc, while changes to the AGN heating temperature lead to substantial differences, with up to $70\%$ variation in gas clustering on small scales ($\lesssim 1 h^{-1}$ Mpc). By examining the suppression of the power spectrum as a function of time, we identify the redshift range $z = 1.5 - 1$ as a key epoch where AGN feedback begins to dominate in these simulations. The 3-point function provides complementary insight to the more familiar 2-point statistics, and shows more pronounced variations between models on the scale of individual haloes. On the other hand, we find that effects on even larger scales are largely comparable.         |

|**Abstract**|            Combining Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array CO(2-1) mapping and JWST near- and mid-infrared imaging, we characterize the relationship between CO(2-1) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at ~100 pc resolution in 66 nearby star-forming galaxies, expanding the sample size from previous ~100 pc resolution studies by more than an order of magnitude. Focusing on regions of galaxies where most of the gas is likely to be molecular, we find strong correlations between CO(2-1) and 3.3 micron, 7.7 micron, and 11.3 micron PAH emission, estimated from JWST's F335M, F770W, and F1130W filters. We derive power law relations between CO(2-1) and PAH emission, which have indices in the range 0.8-1.2, implying relatively weak variations in the observed CO-to-PAH ratios across the regions that we study. We find that CO-to-PAH ratios and scaling relationships near HII regions are similar to those in diffuse sight lines. The main difference between the two types of regions is that sight lines near HII regions show higher intensities in all tracers. Galaxy centers, on the other hand, show higher overall intensities and enhanced CO-to-PAH ratios compared to galaxy disks. Individual galaxies show 0.19 dex scatter in the normalization of CO at fixed I_PAH and this normalization anti-correlates with specific star formation rate (SFR/M*) and correlates with stellar mass. We provide a prescription that accounts for these galaxy-to-galaxy variations and represents our best current empirical predictor to estimate CO(2-1) intensity from PAH emission, which allows one to take advantage of JWST's excellent sensitivity and resolution to trace cold gas.         |

|**Abstract**|            We aim to trace the evolution of eight edge-on star-forming disc galaxies through the analysis of stellar population properties of their thin and thick discs. These galaxies have relatively low stellar masses (4 $\times$ 10$^9$ to 6 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$). We use Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations and full-spectrum fitting to produce spatially resolved maps of ages, metallicities and [Mg/Fe]-abundances and extract the star formation histories of stellar discs. Our maps show thick discs that are on average older, more metal-poor and more [Mg/Fe]-enhanced than thin discs. However, age differences between thin and thick discs are small (around 2 Gyr) and the thick discs are younger than previously observed in more massive and more quiescent galaxies. Both thin and thick discs show mostly sub-solar metallicities, and the vertical metallicity gradient is milder than previously observed in similar studies. [Mg/Fe] differences between thick and thin discs are not sharp. The star formation histories of thick discs extend down to recent times, although most of the mass in young stars was formed in thin discs. Our findings show thick discs that are different from old quiescent thick discs previously observed in galaxies of different morphologies and/or different masses. We propose that thick discs in these galaxies did not form quickly at high redshift, but slowly in an extended time. Also, the thin discs formed slowly, however, a larger mass fraction was created at very recent times.         |

|**Abstract**|            Gravitational redshift and Doppler effects give rise to an antisymmetric component of the galaxy correlation function when cross-correlating two galaxy populations or two different tracers. In this paper, we assess the detectability of these effects in the Euclid spectroscopic galaxy survey. We model the impact of gravitational redshift on the observed redshift of galaxies in the Flagship mock catalogue using a Navarro-Frenk-White profile for the host haloes. We isolate these relativistic effects, largely subdominant in the standard analysis, by splitting the galaxy catalogue into two populations of faint and bright objects and estimating the dipole of their cross-correlation in four redshift bins. In the simulated catalogue, we detect the dipole signal on scales below $30\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, with detection significances of $4\,\sigma$ and $3\,\sigma$ in the two lowest redshift bins, respectively. At higher redshifts, the detection significance drops below $2\,\sigma$. Overall, we estimate the total detection significance in the Euclid spectroscopic sample to be approximately $6\,\sigma$. We find that on small scales, the major contribution to the signal comes from the nonlinear gravitational potential. Our study on the Flagship mock catalogue shows that this observable can be detected in Euclid Data Release 2 and beyond.         |

|**Abstract**|            The composition of protoplanetary disks, and hence the initial conditions of planet formation, may be strongly influenced by the infall and thermal processing of material during the protostellar phase. Composition of dust and ice in protostellar envelopes, shaped by energetic processes driven by the protostar, serves as the fundamental building material for planets and complex organic molecules. As part of the JWST GO program, "Investigating Protostellar Accretion" (IPA), we observed an intermediate-mass protostar HOPS 370 (OMC2-FIR3) using NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS. This study presents the gas and ice phase chemical inventory revealed with the JWST in the spectral range of $\sim$2.9 to 28 $\mu$m and explores the spatial variation of volatile ice species in the protostellar envelope. We find evidence for thermal processing of ice species throughout the inner envelope. We present the first high-spatial resolution ($\sim 80$ au) maps of key volatile ice species H$_{2}$O, CO$_{2}$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, CO, and OCN$^-$, which reveal a highly structured and inhomogeneous density distribution of the protostellar envelope, with a deficiency of ice column density that coincides with the jet/outflow shocked knots. Further, we observe high relative crystallinity of H$_{2}$O ice around the shocked knot seen in the H$_2$ and OH wind/outflow, which can be explained by a lack of outer colder material in the envelope along the line of sight due to the irregular structure of the envelope. These observations show clear evidence of thermal processing of the ices in the inner envelope, close to the outflow cavity walls, heated by the luminous protostar.         |

|**Abstract**|            JWST has revealed an abundance of compact, red objects at $z\approx5-8$ dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs), whose SEDs display a faint blue UV continuum followed by a steep rise in the optical. Despite extensive study of their characteristic V-shaped SEDs, the nature of LRDs remains unknown. We present a new analysis of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum of A2744-QSO1, a triply imaged LRD at $z=7.04$ from the UNCOVER survey. The spectrum shows a strong Balmer break and broad Balmer emission lines, both of which are difficult to explain with models invoking exclusively AGN or stellar contributions. Our fiducial model decomposes the spectrum into a post-starburst galaxy dominating the UV-optical continuum and a reddened AGN being sub-dominant at all wavelength and contributing at $\sim20\%$ level. However, our most credible model infers a stellar mass of $M_\star\approx 4\times10^9\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ within a radius of $r_\mathrm{e}<30\,$pc, driving its central density to the highest among observations to date. This high central density could be explained if A2744-QSO-1 is the early-forming core of a modern-day massive elliptical galaxy that later puffed up via the inside-out growth channel. The models also necessitate an unusually steep dust law to preserve the strong break strength, though this steepness may be explained by a deficit of large dust grains. It is also probable that these challenges reflect our ignorance of A2744-QSO1's true nature. Future variability and reverberation mapping studies could help disentangle the galaxy and AGN contribution to the continuum, and deeper redder observations could also unveil the dust properties in LRDs.         |

|**Abstract**|            A recent study on the spectral energy distribution (SED) of AGN combined unobscured X-ray sources from the eROSITA eFEDS Survey with high quality optical imaging from Subaru's Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC). The HSC data enabled accurate host galaxy subtraction as well as giving a uniform black hole mass estimator from the stellar mass. The resulting stacked optical/X-ray SEDs for black holes at fixed mass show a dramatic transition, where the dominating disc component in bright AGN evaporates into an X-ray hot plasma below $L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$. The models fit to these datasets predicted the largest change in SED in the rest frame UV ($< 3000\,Å$), but this waveband was not included in the original study. Here we use archival $u$-band and UV photometry to extend the SEDs into this range, and confirm the UV is indeed intrinsically faint in AGN below $L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$ as predicted. This dramatic drop in UV photo-ionising flux is also seen from its effect on the broad emission lines. We stack the recently released SDSS DR18 optical spectra for this sample, and show that the broad H$\beta$ line disappears along with the UV bright component at $L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$. This shows that there is a population of unobscured, X-ray bright, UV faint AGN which lack broad emission lines (true type 2 Seyferts).         |

|| Y. Zhao, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-10-10*|

|**Abstract**|            Cosmological simulations indicate that nearly half of the baryons in the nearby Universe are in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) phase, with about half of which residing in cosmic filaments. Recent observational studies using stacked survey data and deep exposures of galaxy cluster outskirts have detected soft X-ray excess associated with optically identified filaments. However, the physical characteristics of WHIM in filaments remain largely undetermined due to the lack of direct spectral diagnostics. In this work, we aim to select appropriate targets for WHIM characterization through pointing observations with the future Hot Universe Baryon Surveyor (HUBS) mission, which is designed with eV level energy resolution in the 0.1-2.0 keV band and a 1 square degree field-of-view. We built a sample of 1577 inter-cluster filaments based on the first eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) supercluster catalog and estimated their soft X-ray emission, and used their modeled geometrical properties and oxygen line intensities to select four most appropriate candidate targets for HUBS observations. By simulating and analyzing their mock observations, we demonstrated that with 200 ks HUBS exposure for each candidate, the gas properties of individual filaments can be accurately determined, with the temperature constrained to +-0.01 keV, metallicity constrained to < +-0.03 solar, and density constrained to < +-10%. Elemental abundance of O, Ne, Mg, and Fe can be measured separately, providing unprecedented insights into the chemical history of the filament gas. We also showed that direct mapping of the WHIM distribution is promising with narrow-band imaging of the O viii line. Our work forecasts that next-generation X-ray missions such as HUBS will provide substantial improvement in our understanding of the physical status and evolution history of the diffuse WHIM gas in cosmic large-scale structure.         |
