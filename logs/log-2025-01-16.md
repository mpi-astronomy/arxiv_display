|**Abstract**|            The beta Pictoris system, with its two directly imaged planets beta Pic b and beta Pic c and its well characterised debris disk, is a prime target for detailed characterisation of young planetary systems. Here, we present high-resolution and high-contrast LM band spectroscopy with CRIRES+ of the system, primarily for the purpose of atmospheric characterisation of beta Pic b. We developed methods for determining slit geometry and wavelength calibration based on telluric absorption and emission lines, as well as methods for PSF modelling and subtraction, and artificial planet injection, in order to extract and characterise planet spectra at a high S/N and spectral fidelity. Through cross-correlation with model spectra, we detected H2O absorption for planet b in each of the 13 individual observations spanning four different spectral settings. This provides a clear confirmation of previously detected water absorption, and allowed us to derive an exquisite precision on the rotational velocity of beta Pic b, v_rot = 20.36 +/- 0.31 km/s, which is consistent within error bars with previous determinations. We also observed a tentative H2O cross-correlation peak at the expected position and velocity of planet c; the feature is however not at a statistically significant level. Despite a higher sensitivity to SiO than earlier studies, we do not confirm a tentative SiO feature previously reported for planet b. When combining data from different epochs and different observing modes for the strong H2O feature of planet b, we find that the S/N grows considerably faster when sets of different spectral settings are combined, compared to when multiple data sets of the same spectral setting are combined. This implies that maximising spectral coverage is often more important than maximising integration depth when investigating exoplanetary atmospheres using cross-correlation techniques.         |

|**Abstract**|            The large apertures of the upcoming generation of Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes will enable unprecedented angular resolutions that scale as $\propto$ $\lambda$/D and higher sensitivities that scale as $D^4$ for point sources corrected by adaptive optics. However, all will have pupil segmentation caused by mechanical struts holding up the secondary mirror [European Extremely Large Telescope and Thirty Meter Telescope] or intrinsically, by design, as in the Giant Magellan Telescope. These gaps will be separated by more than a typical atmospheric coherence length (Fried Parameter). The pupil fragmentation at scales larger than the typical atmospheric coherence length, combined with wavefront sensors with weak or ambiguous sensitivity to differential piston, can introduce differential piston areas of the wavefront known as "petal modes". Commonly used wavefront sensors, such as a pyramid WFS, also struggle with phase wrapping caused by >$\lambda$/2 differential piston WFE. We have developed the holographic dispersed fringe sensor, a single pupil-plane optic that employs holography to interfere the dispersed light from each segment onto different spatial locations in the focal plane to sense and correct differential piston between the segments. This allows for a very high and linear dynamic piston sensing range of approximately $\pm$10 $\mu$m. We have begun the initial attempts at phasing a segmented pupil utilizing the HDFS on the High Contrast Adaptive optics phasing Testbed and the Extreme Magellan Adaptive Optics instrument (MagAO-X) at the University of Arizona. Additionally, we have demonstrated use of the HDFS as a differential piston sensor on-sky for the first time. We were able to phase each segment to within $\pm\lambda$/11.3 residual piston WFE ($\lambda$ = 800 nm) of a reference segment and achieved ~50 nm RMS residual piston WFE across the aperture in poor seeing conditions.         |

|**Abstract**|            As part of the LAMOST medium-resolution spectroscopic survey, the LAMOST-MRS-O is a non-time domain survey that aims to perform medium-resolution spectral observations for member stars in the open cluster area. This survey plans to obtain the spectroscopic parameters such as radial velocity and metal abundances of member stars and provide data support for further study on the chemical and dynamical characteristics and evolution of open clusters in combination with Gaia data. We have completed the observations on ten open cluster fields and obtained 235184 medium-resolution spectra of 133792 stars. Based on the data analyzed of LAMOST DR11V1.1, for some clusters of particular concern, it is found that the sampling ratio of members stars with Gmag < 15 mag can reach 70%, which indicates that the LAMOST-MRS-O has reached our initial design goal.         |

|**Abstract**|            OJ 287 is a bright blazar with century-long observations, and one of the strongest candidates to host a supermassive black hole binary. Its polarisation behaviour between 2015 and 2017 (MJD 57300-58000) contains several interesting events that we re-contextualise in this study. We collected optical photometric and polarimetric data from several telescopes and obtained high-cadence light curves from this period. In the radio band, we collected mm-wavelength polarisation data from the AMAPOLA program. We combined these with existing multifrequency polarimetric radio results and the results of very-long-baseline-interferometry imaging with the Global mm-VLBI Array at 86 GHz. In December 2015, an optical flare was seen according to the general relativistic binary black hole model. We suggest that the overall activity near the accretion disk and the jet base during this time may be connected to the onset of a new moving component K seen in the jet in March 2017. With the additional optical data, we find a fast polarisation angle rotation of 210 degrees coinciding with the December 2015 flare, hinting at a possible link between these events. Based on the 86-GHz images, we calculated a new speed of 0.12 mas/yr for K, which places it inside the core at the time of the 2015 flare. This speed also supports the scenario where the passage of K through the quasi-stationary feature S1 could have been the trigger for the very-high-energy gamma-ray flare of OJ 287 seen in February 2017. With the mm-polarisation data, we established that these bands follow the cm-band data but show a difference during the time of K passing through S1. This indicates that the mm-bands trace the substructures of the jet still unresolved in the cm-bands.         |

|**Abstract**|            Data from the Euclid space telescope will enable cosmic shear measurements with very small statistical errors, requiring corresponding systematic error control level. A common approach to correct for shear biases involves calibrating shape measurement methods using image simulations with known input shear. Given their high resolution, Hubble Space Telescope (HST) galaxies can, in principle, be utilised to emulate Euclid observations. In this work, we employ a GalSim-based testing environment to investigate whether uncertainties in the HST point spread function (PSF) model or in data processing techniques introduce significant biases in weak-lensing (WL) shear calibration. We used single SÃ©rsic galaxy models to simulate both HST and Euclid observations. We then `Euclidised' our HST simulations and compared the results with the directly simulated Euclid-like images. For this comparison, we utilised a moment-based shape measurement algorithm and galaxy model fits. Through the Euclidisation procedure, we effectively reduced the residual multiplicative biases in shear measurements to sub-percent levels. This achievement was made possible by employing either the native pixel scales of the instruments, utilising the Lanczos15 interpolation kernel, correcting for noise correlations, and ensuring consistent galaxy signal-to-noise ratios between simulation branches. However, the Euclidisation procedure requires further analysis on the impact of the correlated noise, to estimate calibration bias. Additionally, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the accuracy of TinyTim HST PSF models using star fields observed in the F606W and F814W filters. We observe that F606W images exhibit a broader scatter in the recovered best-fit focus, compared to those in the F814W filter.         |
