|**Abstract**| The Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescope for Survey (TMTS) has been constantly monitoring the northern sky since 2020 in search of rapidly variable stars. To find variable white dwarfs (WDs), the TMTS catalog is cross-matched with the WD catalog of Gaia EDR3, resulting in over 3000 light curves of WD candidates. The WD TMTS J17184064+2524314 (hereafter J1718) is the second ZZ~Ceti star discovered among these common sources. Based on the light curves from TMTS, follow-up photometric observations, and TESS, 10 periods and 3 combination periods are detected. A rotation period of $25.12\pm0.18$ hr is derived, according to the identified rotational splitting. Our spectroscopic observation indicates that this WD belongs to DA type with $T_{\rm eff}=11,670\pm604$ K, log $g=8.16\pm0.36$, $M = 0.70\pm0.23$ M$_{\odot}$, and age=$0.51\pm0.34$ Gyr. Based on core-parameterized asteroseismological model grids ($\geqslant$ 14 million), we derive a best-fit solution of $T_{\rm eff}=11,640\pm20$ K, log $g=8.267\pm0.008$, and $M = 0.750\pm0.005$ M$_{\odot}$ for J1718, consistent with the spectral fitting results. For this WD, the corresponding carbon and oxygen abundances in the core are 0.43 and 0.57, respectively. The distance derived from the intrinsic luminosity given by asteroseismology is $64\pm15$ pc, in accord with the distance of $70.1\pm0.2$ pc from Gaia DR3 within the uncertainties. |

|**Abstract**| We study young massive clusters (YMCs) in their embedded "infant" phase with $\sim$0.1" ALMA, HST, and JWST observations targeting the central starburst ring in NGC 3351, a nearby Milky Way analog galaxy. Our new ALMA data reveal 18 bright and compact (sub-)millimeter continuum sources, of which 11 have apparent counterparts in JWST images and only 6 have counterparts in HST images. Based on the ALMA continuum and molecular line data, as well as ancillary measurements for the HST and JWST counterparts, we identify 14 sources as infant star clusters with high stellar and/or gas masses (${\sim}10^5\;\mathrm{M_\odot}$), small radii (${\lesssim}\,5\;\mathrm{pc}$), large escape velocities ($6{-}10\;\mathrm{km/s}$), and short free-fall times ($0.5{-}1\;\mathrm{Myr}$). Their multiwavelength properties motivate us to divide them into four categories, likely corresponding to four evolutionary stages from starless clumps to exposed HII region-cluster complexes. Leveraging age estimates for HST-identified clusters in the same region, we infer an evolutionary timeline going from $1{-}2\;\mathrm{Myr}$ before cluster formation as starless clumps, to $4{-}6\;\mathrm{Myr}$ after as exposed HII region-cluster complexes. Finally, we show that the YMCs make up a substantial fraction of recent star formation across the ring, exhibit an non-uniform azimuthal distribution without a very coherent evolutionary trend along the ring, and are capable of driving large-scale gas outflows. |
