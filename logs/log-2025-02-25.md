|**Abstract**|            The distribution and physical conditions of molecular gas are closely linked to star formation and the subsequent evolution of galaxies. Emission from carbon monoxide (CO) and its isotopologues traces the bulk of molecular gas and provides constraints on the physical conditions through their line ratios. However, comprehensive understanding on how the particular choice of line modeling approach impacts derived molecular properties remain incomplete. Here, we study the nearby starburst galaxy M82, known for its intense star formation and molecular emission, using the large set of available multi-CO line observations. We present high-resolution (${\sim}85$ pc) emission of seven CO isotopologue lines, including $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O from the $J = 1-0$, $2-1$ and $3-2$ transitions. Using \texttt{RADEX} for radiative transfer modeling, we analyze M82\textsc{\char39}s molecular properties with (i) a one-zone model and (ii) a variable density model, comparing observed and simulated emissions via a minimum $\chi^2$ analysis. We find that inferred gas conditions -- kinetic temperature and density -- are consistent across models, with minimal statistical differences. However, due to their low critical densities (${<}10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$), low-$J$ CO isotopologue lines do not effectively probe higher density gas prevalent in starburst environments like that of M82. Our results further imply that this limitation extends to high-redshift ($z{\gtrapprox}1$) galaxies with similar conditions, where low-$J$ CO lines are inadequate for density constraints. Future studies of extreme star-forming regions like M82 will require higher-$J$ CO lines or alternative molecular tracers with higher critical densities.         |

|| M. Bayer, et al. -- incl., <mark>N. Martin</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            Providing a detailed picture of the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream offers important constraints on the build-up of the Galactic halo as well as its gravitational potential at large radii. While several attempts have been made to model the structure of the Sgr stream, no model has yet been able to match all the features observed for the stream. Moreover, for several of these features, observational characterisation of their properties is rather limited, particularly at large distances. The aim of this work is to investigate the kinematics of the Sgr stream outermost spur feature using blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars. Candidate BHB stars were selected by combining two approaches; one capitalising on Pan-STARRS1 3$\Pi$ griz and u photometry taken as part of UNIONS, the other using Pristine Survey CaHK and SDSS ugr photometry. Follow-up optical spectra are obtained using ESO/VLT/FORS2 to confirm their BHB nature and obtain line-of-sight (LOS) velocities. Of our 25 candidates, 20 stars can be confirmed as bona fide BHB stars. Their LOS velocities, together with the 3D positions of these stars qualitatively match well with Sgr model predictions and trace the outer apocentre of the trailing arm and its spur feature very nicely. The quantitative offsets that are found between our data and the different models can be used to provide information about the Galactic gravitational potential at large distances. We present a first, tentative, analysis in this direction, showing that the model of Vasiliev et al. (2021) would provide better agreement with our observations if the enclosed mass of the Milky Way within 100 kpc were lowered to $(5.3\!\pm\!0.4)\!\times\!10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ (versus $(5.6\!\pm\!0.4)\!\times\!10^{11}$ M$_\odot$). Our selection of BHB stars provides a new view on the outermost structure in 3D positions and LOS velocities of the Sgr debris.         |

|| R. A. Lee, et al. -- incl., <mark>I. J. M. Crossfield</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-02-25*|

|**Abstract**|            We report the confirmation of TOI-6324 b, an Earth-sized (1.059 $\pm$ 0.041 R$_\oplus$) ultra-short-period (USP) planet orbiting a nearby ($\sim$20 pc) M dwarf. Using the newly commissioned Keck Planet Finder (KPF) spectrograph, we have measured the mass of TOI-6324 b 1.17 $\pm$ 0.22 M$_\oplus$. Because of its extremely short orbit of just $\sim$6.7 hours, TOI-6324 b is intensely irradiated by its M dwarf host, and is expected to be stripped of any thick, H/He envelope. We were able to constrain its interior composition and found an iron core mass fraction (CMF = 27$\pm$37%) consistent with that of Earth ($\sim$33%) and other confirmed USPs. TOI-6324 b is the closest to Earth-sized USP confirmed to date. TOI-6324 b is a promising target for JWST phase curve and secondary eclipse observations (Emission Spectroscopy Metric = 25) which may reveal its surface mineralogy, day-night temperature contrast, and possible tidal deformation. From 7 sectors of TESS data, we report a tentative detection of the optical phase curve variation with an amplitude of 42$\pm$28 ppm.         |

|**Abstract**|            Dense cores in massive, parsec-scale molecular clumps are sites that harbor protocluster formation. We present results from observations towards a hub-filament structure of a massive Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G14.225-0.506 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The dense cores are revealed by the 1.3 mm dust continuum emission at an angular resolution of $\sim$ 1.5'' and are identified through the hierarchical Dendrogram technique. Combining with the N$_2$D$^+$ 3-2 spectral line emission and gas temperatures derived from a previous NH$_3$ study, we analyze the thermodynamic properties of the dense cores. The results show transonic and supersonic-dominated turbulent motions. There is an inverse correlation between the virial parameter and the column density, which implies that denser regions may undergo stronger gravitational collapse. Molecular outflows are identified in the CO 2-1 and SiO 5-4 emission, indicating active protostellar activities in some cores. Besides these star formation signatures revealed by molecular outflows in the dense cores, previous studies in the infrared, X-ray, and radio wavelengths also found a rich and wide-spread population of young stellar objects (YSOs), showing active star formation both inside and outside of the dense cloud.         |

|| Y. Tang, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-02-25*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            Asteroid shape inversion using photometric data has been a key area of study in planetary science and astronomical this http URL, the current methods for asteroid shape inversion require extensive iterative calculations, making the process time-consuming and prone to becoming stuck in local optima. We directly established a mapping between photometric data and shape distribution through deep neural networks. In addition, we used 3D point clouds to represent asteroid shapes and utilized the deviation between the light curves of non-convex asteroids and their convex hulls to predict the concave areas of non-convex asteroids. We compared the results of different shape models using the Chamfer distance between traditional methods and ours and found that our method performs better, especially when handling special shapes. For the detection of concave areas on the convex hull, the intersection over union (IoU) of our predictions reached 0.89. We further validated this method using observational data from the Lowell Observatory to predict the convex shapes of the asteroids 3337 Milo and 1289 Kuta, and conducted light curve fitting experiments. The experimental results demonstrated the robustness and adaptability of the method         |

|*Appeared on*| *2025-02-25*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            China plans to launch a probe (Tianwen-2) around 2025, mainly for exploring the near-Earth asteroid 2016 HO3 . The mission involves close-range exploration, landing, and mining operations that require three-dimensional modeling of the asteroid, which requires prior knowledge of its material composition and uniformity. This information is crucial in progressive or ground exploration processes. Our research focuses on high-precision intelligent inversion of complex physical properties of asteroids based on spectral data, providing support for further analysis of aster oid materials, density, and structure. We have developed a platform for asteroid spectral classification, albedo estimation, and composition analysis, which includes three types of neural networks based on Transformer attention mechanism: One for spectral classification, achieving a four-class classification accuracy of 97.28% and an eleven-class classification accuracy of 95.69%; second one for albedo estimation, with an average absolute error of 0.0308 in S-type asteroid albedo estimation, and the third one for composition analysis, with a predicted spectral angular distance of only 0.0340 and a root mean square error of 0.1759 for the abundance of end members. These results indicate that our network can provide high-precision asteroid spectral classification, albedo estimation, and composition analysis results. In addition, we utilized the platform to analyze and provide results for six asteroids.         |

|**Abstract**|            This work presents visual morphological and dynamical classifications for 637 spatially resolved galaxies, most of which are at intermediate redshift ($z\sim0.3$), in the Middle-Ages Galaxy Properties with Integral field spectroscopy (MAGPI) Survey. For each galaxy, we obtain a minimum of 11 independent visual classifications by knowledgeable classifiers. We use an extension of the standard Dawid-Skene bayesian model introducing classifier-specific confidence parameters and galaxy-specific difficulty parameters to quantify classifier confidence and infer reliable statistical confidence estimates. Selecting sub-samples of 86 bright ($r<20$ mag) high-confidence ($>0.98$) morphological classifications at redshifts ($0.2 \le z \le0.4$), we confirm the full range of morphological types is represented in MAGPI as intended in the survey design. Similarly, with a sub-sample of 82 bright high-confidence stellar kinematic classifications, we find that the rotating and non-rotating galaxies seen at low redshift are already in place at intermediate redshifts. We \textit{do not} find evidence that the kinematic morphology-density relation seen at $z\sim0$ is established at $z\sim0.3$. We suggest that galaxies without obvious stellar rotation are dynamically pre-processed sometime before $z\sim0.3$ within lower mass groups before joining denser environments.         |

|**Abstract**|            HSC 120505.09-000027.9 (J1205$-$0000) is one of the highest redshift ($z=6.72$) dust-reddened quasars (red quasars) known to date. We present an improved analysis of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array data of the [CII] $158\ \rm{\mu m}$ line and the underlying rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) continuum emission, previously reported in Izumi et al. (2021a), toward J1205$-$0000. Red quasars are thought to be a transitional phase from an obscured starburst to a luminous blue quasar, in some cases associated with massive outflows driven by the active galactic nucleus (AGN). J1205$-$0000 has a high FIR luminosity, $L_{\mathrm{FIR}}=2.5\times 10^{12}\ L_{\odot}$ and a total IR luminosity of $L_{\mathrm{TIR}}=3.5\times 10^{12}\ L_{\odot}$, corresponding to a star formation rate (SFR) of $\sim 528\ M_{\odot}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. With the [CII]-based dynamical mass of $\sim 1 \times 10^{11}~M_\odot$, we conclude that J1205$-$0000 is hosted by a starburst galaxy. In contradiction to Izumi et al. (2021a), our improved analysis shows no hint of a broad component in the [CII] line spectrum. Thus there is no evidence for a host galaxy-scale fast [CII] outflow, despite the fact that J1205$-$0000 has fast nuclear ionized outflows seen in the rest-frame UV. We explore several scenarios for this discrepancy (e.g., early phase of AGN feedback, reliability of the [CII] line as a tracer of outflows), and we claim that it is still too early to conclude that there is no significant negative AGN feedback on star formation in this red quasar.         |
