|**Abstract**|            Since the recent discovery of the directly imaged super-Jovian planet AF Lep b, several studies have been conducted to characterize its atmosphere and constrain its orbital parameters. AF Lep b has a measured dynamical mass of $3.68 \pm 0.48$ MJup, a radius of $1.3 \pm 0.15$ RJup, a nearly circular orbit in spin-orbit alignment with the host star, a relatively high metallicity, and a near-solar to super-solar C/O ratio. However, key parameters such as the rotational velocity and radial velocity could not be estimated as they require high-resolution spectroscopic data that is impossible to obtain with classical spectrographs. AF Lep b was recently observed with the new HiRISE visitor instrument at the VLT, with the goal of obtaining high-resolution (R~140,000) spectroscopic observations to better constrain the orbital and atmospheric parameters of the young giant exoplanet. We compare the extracted spectrum of AF Lep b to self-consistent atmospheric models using ForMoSA. We then use our measurements of the radial velocity of the planet to provide new constraints on the orbit of the planet. From the forward modeling, we find a C/O ratio that aligns with previous low-resolution analyses, and we confirm the super-solar metallicity. We also confirm unambiguously the presence of methane in the atmosphere of the companion. Based on all available relative astrometry and radial velocity measurements of the host star, we show that two distinct orbital populations are possible for the companion. We derive the radial velocity of AF Lep b to be $10.51 \pm 1.03$ km/s, and show that this value agrees well with one of the two orbital solutions, allowing us to rule out an entire family of orbits. Additionally, assuming that the rotation and orbit are coplanar, the derived planet's rotation rate is consistent with the observed trend of increasing spin velocity with higher planet mass.         |

|**Abstract**|            During thermonuclear bursts, it is suspected that {\bf the cooling of the corona by the burst emission} may be the cause of hard X-ray {\bf deficits}. Although this {\bf deficit} has been observed in nine sources, it has not been observed {\bf from} 4U~1608--52, a nearby prolific burster. Therefore, the authenticity and universality of the hard X-ray {\bf deficit} may be in question. To investigate this suspicion, Insight-HXMT performed cadence observations during the low/hard state of 4U~1608--52 in September 2022 and detected 10 thermonuclear X-ray bursts. Two of these bursts show a double-peaked structure in the soft X-ray band, which could be caused by the high temperature of the burst emission and a marginal photospheric radius expansion (PRE) around the burst peak time. This is indicated by their peak fluxes being up to the Eddington limit and having a large color factor at the peak of the bursts. The hard X-ray deficit is significantly observed during bursts at $>$ 30 keV. Furthermore, the fraction of this deficit shows saturation at 50\% for the first 8 bursts. This saturation may indicate that the corona is layered and only a part of the corona is cooled by the bursts. For example, the part close to the NS surface is cooled while the rest remains intact during bursts. This result provides a clue to the geometry of the corona, e.g., a possible scenario is that the corona has two forms: a quasi-spheric corona between the NS and the disk, and a disk-corona on both surfaces of the disk.         |

|**Abstract**|            Thermonuclear X-ray bursts occur on the surface of an accreting neutron star (NS), and their characteristics and interplay with the surrounding circumstance could be a clue to understand the nature of the NS and accretion process. For this purpose, Insight-HXMT has performed high cadence observations on the bright thermonuclear X-ray burster--4U~1608--52 during its outburst in July and August 2022; nine bursts were detected, including seven bursts with the photospheric radius expansion (PRE). Time-resolved spectroscopy of the bright PRE bursts reveals that an enhancement of accretion rate or the Comptonization of the burst emission by the corona could reduce the residuals when fitting their spectra with the conventional model--blackbody. The inferred energy increment rate of the burst photon gained from the corona is up to $\sim$40\%, even though the bursts have different peak fluxes and locate at different accretion rates. Moreover, the flux shortage of the rising PRE is observed in the bursts at a high mass accretion rate, but not for the burst with a faint persistent emission, which has been predicted theoretically but first observed in this work. If the flux shortage is due to the disk obscuration, i.e., the burst emission is anisotropic, the phenomenon above could indicate that the anisotropy of the burst emission is accretion rate dependent, which could also be evidence of the truncated disk in the low/hard state.         |

|**Abstract**|            We use the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to observe the bright millisecond pulsar (MSP) PSR B1937+21 (J1939+2134) and record the data in the band from 1.0 GHz to 1.5 GHz. We measure the neutral hydrogen (HI) emission and absorption lines near 1420 MHz ($\lambda \simeq 21$ cm). We derive the kinematic distance of the pulsar with the HI observation, and update the upper bound of kinematic distance from the previous $14.8\pm 0.9$ npc in the Outer Arm to the nearer $9.4\pm 0.5$ kpc in the Perseus Arm. By comparing with the archival absorption spectra observed decades ago, we notice possible variations in the absorption spectra towards this pulsar, which corresponds to a possible tiny-scale atomic structure (TSAS) of a few AU in size. We also verify the apparent faster-than-light anomalous dispersion at the HI absorption line of this pulsar previously reported.         |
