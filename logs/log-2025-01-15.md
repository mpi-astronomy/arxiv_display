|**Abstract**|            The vertical shear instability and the streaming instability are two robust sources of turbulence in protoplanetary disks. The former has been found to induce anisotropic turbulence that is stronger in the vertical than in the radial dimension and to be overall stronger compared to the largely isotropic turbulence caused by the streaming instability. In this study, we shed light on the dust diffusion by the vertical shear instability and the streaming instability separately and together, and in particular on the direction- and scale-dependence of the diffusion. To this end, we employ two-dimensional global models of the two instabilities either in isolation or in combination. The vertical shear instability in isolation diffuses dust more strongly in the vertical direction than the streaming instability in isolation, resulting in a wave-shaped dust layer in our two-dimensional simulations. Compared with this large-scale diffusion, though, our study highlights that the vertical shear instability causes substantially weaker or even negligible small-scale diffusion. We validate this result using previously published three-dimensional simulations. In particular when simulating centimetre-sized dust, the undulating dust layer becomes internally razor-thin. In contrast, the diffusion owing to the streaming instability exhibits only a marginal scale-dependence, with the dust layer possessing a Gaussian shape. In models including both instabilities, the undulating mid-plane layer is broadened to a width set by the intrinsic diffusion level caused by the streaming instability.         |

|**Abstract**|            With enough X-ray flux to be detected in a 160s scan by SRG/eROSITA, the $z = 6.19$ quasar CFHQS J142952+544717 is, by far, the most luminous X-ray source known at $z > 6$. We present deep (245 ks) NuSTAR observations of this source; with $\sim180$ net counts in the combined observations, CFHQS J142952+544717 is the most distant object ever observed by the observatory. Fortuitously, this source was independently observed by Chandra $\sim110$ days earlier, enabling the identification of two nearby (30'' and 45'' away), fainter X-ray sources. We jointly fit both Chandra and NuSTAR observations--self-consistently including interloper sources--and find that, to greater than 90% confidence, the observed 3-7 keV flux varied by a factor of $\sim2.6$ during that period, corresponding to approximately two weeks in the quasar rest-frame. This brightening is one the most extreme instances of statistically significant X-ray variability seen in the Epoch of Reionization. We discuss possible scenarios that could produce such rapid change, including X-ray emission from jets too faint at radio frequencies to be observed.         |

|**Abstract**|            The disintegrating ultra-short period rocky exoplanet K2-22b periodically emits dusty clouds in a dynamically chaotic process resulting in a variable transit depth from 0-1.3%. The effluents that sublimate off the surface and condense out in space are probably representative of the formerly interior layers convectively transported to the molten surface. Transmission spectroscopy of these transiting clouds reveal spectral fingerprints of the interior composition of this rocky world. We used JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) as a low-resolution slitless spectrograph to observe four predicted transit windows for K2-22b. For each observation, we extracted a transmission spectrum over the spectral range of 4.3-11.8 $\mu$m. We detect one transit at high significance and two at low significance. We find that the data 1) disfavor featureless, iron-dominated core material, 2) are consistent with some form of magnesium silicate minerals, likely from mantle material, and 3) show a distinct and unexpected feature at $\sim$5 $\mu$m. The unexpected feature, also seen weakly in the low-significance transits, is consistent with some gas features, possibly NO and/or CO$_2$. These findings warrant further study to improve the constraints on the composition of this disintegrating rocky world.         |

|**Abstract**|            A 2.1-year periodic oscillation of the gamma-ray flux from the blazar PG 1553+113 has previously been tentatively identified in almost 7 year of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. After 15 years of Fermi sky-survey observations, doubling the total time range, we report >7 cycle gamma-ray modulation with an estimated significance of 4 sigma against stochastic red noise. Independent determinations of oscillation period and phase in the earlier and the new data are in close agreement (chance probability <0.01). Pulse timing over the full light curve is also consistent with a coherent periodicity. Multiwavelength new data from Swift X-Ray Telescope, Burst Alert Telescope, and UVOT, and from KAIT, Catalina Sky Survey, All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, and Owens Valley Radio Observatory ground-based observatories as well as archival Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer satellite-All Sky Monitor data, published optical data of Tuorla, and optical historical Harvard plates data are included in our work. Optical and radio light curves show clear correlations with the gamma-ray modulation, possibly with a nonconstant time lag for the radio flux. We interpret the gamma-ray periodicity as possibly arising from a pulsational accretion flow in a sub-parsec binary supermassive black hole system of elevated mass ratio, with orbital modulation of the supplied material and energy in the jet. Other astrophysical scenarios introduced include instabilities, disk and jet precession, rotation or nutation, and perturbations by massive stars or intermediate-mass black holes in polar orbit.         |

|**Abstract**|            Globular clusters (GCs) are some of the oldest bound structures in the Universe, holding clues to the earliest epochs of star formation and galaxy assembly. However, accurate age measurements of ancient clusters are challenging due to the age-metallicity degeneracy. Here, we report the discovery of 42 compact stellar systems within the 'Relic', a massive, quiescent galaxy at $z=2.53$. The Relic resides in an over-density behind the Abell 2744 cluster, with a prominent tidal tail extending towards two low-mass companions. Using deep data from the UNCOVER/MegaScience JWST Surveys, we find that clusters formed in age intervals ranging from 8 Myr up to $\sim2$ Gyr, suggesting a rich formation history starting at $z\sim10$. While the cluster-based star formation history is broadly consistent with the high past star formation rates derived from the diffuse host galaxy light, one potential discrepancy is a tentative $\sim2-3\times$ higher rate in the cluster population for the past Gyr. Taken together with the spatial distribution and low inferred metallicities of these young-to-intermediate age clusters, we may be seeing direct evidence for the accretion of star clusters in addition to their early in-situ formation. The cluster masses are high, $\sim10^6-10^7~M_{\odot}$, which may explain why we are able to detect them around this likely post-merger galaxy. Overall, the Relic clusters are consistent with being precursors of the most massive present-day GCs. This unique laboratory enables the first connection between long-lived, high-redshift clusters and local stellar populations, offering insights into the early stages of GC evolution and the broader processes of galaxy assembly.         |
