|**Abstract**| This is a technical report for band 4 (550-900 MHz) polarization data with the upgraded GMRT (uGMRT). The report describes the band 4 polarization data analysis procedure and includes notes for observers who are planning polarization observations with the uGMRT. A few pipelines that are currently being used and tested by astronomers at NCRA are discussed as well. |
