|**Abstract**| The peptide-like molecules, cyanoformamide (NCCONH2), is the cyano (CN) derivative of formamide (NH2CHO). It is known to play a role in the synthesis of nucleic acid precursors under prebiotic conditions. In this paper, we present a tentative detection of NCCONH2 in the interstellar medium (ISM) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) archive data. Ten unblended lines of NCCONH2 were seen around 3sigma noise levels toward Sagittarius B2(N1E), a position that is slightly offset from the continuum peak. The column density of NCCONH2 was estimated to be 2.4\times 10^15 cm ^-2, and the fractional abundance of NCCONH2 toward Sgr B2(N1E) was 6.9\times10^-10. The abundance ratio between NCCONH2 and NH2CHO is estimated to be ~0.01. We also searched for other peptide-like molecules toward Sgr B2(N1E). The abundances of NH2CHO, CH3NCO and CH3NHCHO toward Sgr B2(N1E) were about one tenth of those toward Sgr B2(N1S), while the abundances of CH3CONH2 was only one twentieth of that toward Sgr B2(N1S). |

|**Abstract**| In this paper we introduce the software package ProPane, written for the R data analysis language. ProPane combines the full range of wcslib projections with the C++ image manipulation routines provided by the CImg library. ProPane offers routines for image warping and combining (including stacking), and various related tasks such as image alignment tweaking and pixel masking. It can stack an effectively unlimited number of target frames using multiple parallel cores, and offers threading for many lower level routines. It has been used for a number of current and upcoming large surveys, and we present a range of its capabilities and features. ProPane is already available under a permissive open-source LGPL-3 license at github.com/asgr/ProPane (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.10057053). |

|**Abstract**| The NASA's Double-Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) was a unique planetary defence and technology test mission, the first of its kind. The main spacecraft of the DART mission impacted the target asteroid Dimorphos, a small moon orbiting asteroid (65803) Didymos, on 2022 September 26. The impact brought up a mass of ejecta which, together with the direct momentum transfer from the collision, caused an orbital period change of 33 +/- 1 minutes, as measured by ground-based observations. We report here the outcome of the optical monitoring campaign of the Didymos system from the Danish 1.54 m telescope at La Silla around the time of impact. The observations contributed to the determination of the changes in the orbital parameters of the Didymos-Dimorphos system, as reported by arXiv:2303.02077, but in this paper we focus on the ejecta produced by the DART impact. We present photometric measurements from which we remove the contribution from the Didymos-Dimorphos system using a H-G photometric model. Using two photometric apertures we determine the fading rate of the ejecta to be 0.115 +/- 0.003 mag/d (in a 2" aperture) and 0.086 +/- 0.003 mag/d (5") over the first week post-impact. After about 8 days post-impact we note the fading slows down to 0.057 +/- 0.003 mag/d (2" aperture) and 0.068 +/- 0.002 mag/d (5"). We include deep-stacked images of the system to illustrate the ejecta evolution during the first 18 days, noting the emergence of dust tails formed from ejecta pushed in the anti-solar direction, and measuring the extent of the particles ejected sunward to be at least 4000 km. |
