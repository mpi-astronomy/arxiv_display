|**Abstract**|            I present spherical (this https URL), a software package and database designed for the ESO VLT/SPHERE high-contrast imager. SPHERE has produced the world's largest archive of direct imaging observations of exoplanets and circumstellar disks, but its heterogeneous metadata and fragmented reduction tools make end-to-end analysis labor-intensive. spherical addresses this by combining (1) a curated, regularly updated, and searchable database of all SPHERE observations, cross-matched with stellar properties and observing conditions, and (2) a Python-based, script-driven pipeline for the Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS). The database, archived on Zenodo (this https URL) and reproducible from the ESO archive, currently includes about 6000 IRDIS dual-band imaging, about 1000 IRDIS polarimetric, and about 4500 IFS sequences, with additional modes (ZIMPOL, IRDIS-LSS, SAM) planned. The pipeline automates raw data retrieval, calibration, and IFS reduction with the adapted open-source CHARIS instrument pipeline, followed by astrometric and photometric calibration and post-processing with TRAP for companion detection and spectral extraction. spherical lowers the barrier from raw files to science-ready products, enabling homogeneous population studies, atmospheric characterization of companions, and efficient survey follow-up, while remaining interoperable with community tools such as VIP, pyKLIP, and IRDAP.         |

|**Abstract**|            The existence of abundant post-starburst/quiescent galaxies just $\sim$1-2 Gyrs after the Big Bang challenges our current paradigm of galaxy evolution. Cosmological simulations suggest that quasar feedback is likely the most promising mechanism responsible for such rapid quenching. Here we report a high detection rate (6/27) of exceptionally fast and powerful galaxy-scale outflows traced by [O III] emission in z $\sim$ 5-6 luminous quasars as revealed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with velocity up to $\sim$8400 km s$^{-1}$ and order-of-magnitude kinetic energy outflow rates up to $\sim$260% the observed quasar bolometric luminosities. This fraction is $\gtrsim$6.6 times larger than that in luminosity-matched comparison samples at z $\sim$ 1.5-3.5 (0/58) and z $<$ 1 (5/148). These extreme outflows are comparable to or even faster than the most rapid [O III] outflows reported at z $\lesssim$ 3, and could reach the circumgalactic medium (CGM) or even the intergalactic medium (IGM). The average kinetic energy outflow rate of our entire sample is $\sim$230$\times$ higher than that at cosmic noon. The substantially higher frequency of outflows with energetics well above the threshold for negative feedback in our sample strongly suggests that quasar feedback plays a significant role in efficiently quenching/regulating early massive galaxies.         |

|**Abstract**|            We model the short gamma-ray bursts (GRB) 090510 as the product of a magnetized neutron star (NS) binary merger. Accounting for the NS critical mass constraint given by the mass of PSR J0952--0607, we infer that GRB 090510 was a highly-magnetized NS-NS merger that left as remnant a Kerr black hole (BH) of $2.4 M_\odot$ with a low-mass accretion disk. The gamma-ray precursor is powered by the magnetic energy released during the merger of the NSs. The prompt emission originates at the transparency of an ultra-relativistic $e^+e^-$ pair-plasma produced by the overcritical electric field induced by the rotating strong magnetic field around the merged object before it reaches the critical mass, the GeV emission by the extractable energy of the newborn BH, and the X-ray afterglow by accretion onto it. We derive the masses of the merging NSs, their magnetic fields, the BH mass, spin, and irreducible mass, the strength of the magnetic field, the disk mass, and obtain an estimate of the gravitational-wave emission during the merger phase preceding the prompt short GRB emission. The inferred parameters agree with up-to-date numerical relativity simulations, confirming that strong magnetic fields above $10^{14}$ G develop in NS-NS mergers and that mergers leading to a central BH remnant have low-mass disks of $\sim 10^{-2} M_\odot$. We also advance the possibility that quasi-period oscillations of tens of Hz of frequency due to Lense-Thirring precession of the matter surrounding the merged object before BH formation can explain the successive spikes following the prompt emission peak.         |
