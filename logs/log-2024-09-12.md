|**Abstract**|            We present a sample of 50 H-alpha detected broad-line active galactic nuclei (BLAGN) at redshifts 3.5<z<6.8 using data from the CEERS and RUBIES surveys. We select these sources directly from JWST/NIRSpec G395M/F290LP spectra. We use a multi-step pre-selection and a Bayesian fitting procedure to ensure a high-quality sample of sources with broad Balmer lines and narrow forbidden lines. We compute rest-frame ultraviolet and optical spectral slopes for these objects, and determine that 10 BLAGN in our sample are also little red dots (LRDs). These LRD BLAGN, when examined in aggregate, show broader H-alpha line profiles and a higher fraction of broad-to-narrow component H-alpha emission than non-LRD BLAGN. Moreover, we find that ~66% of these objects are intrinsically reddened (beta (optical)>0), independent of the contributions of emission lines to the broadband photometry. We construct the black hole (BH) mass function at 3.5<z<6 after computing robust observational and line detection completeness corrections. This BH mass function shows broad agreement with both recent JWST/NIRSpec and JWST/NIRCam WFSS based BH mass functions, though we extend these earlier results to log(M(BH)/M(sun)) < 7. The derived BH mass function is consistent with a variety of theoretical models, indicating that the observed abundance of black holes in the early universe is not discrepant with physically-motivated predictions. The BH mass function shape resembles a largely featureless power-law, suggesting that any signature from black-hole seeding has been lost by redshift z~5-6. Finally, we compute the BLAGN UV luminosity function and find good agreement with JWST-detected BLAGN samples from recent works, finding that BLAGN hosts constitute <10% of the total observed UV luminosity at all but the brightest luminosities.         |

|**Abstract**|            Understanding the rapid formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early universe requires an understanding of how stellar mass grows in the host galaxies. Here, we perform an analysis of rest-frame optical spectra and imaging from JWST of two quasar host galaxies at z>6 which exhibit Balmer absorption lines. These features in the stellar continuum indicate a lack of young stars, similar to low-redshift post-starburst galaxies whose star formation was recently quenched. We find that the stellar mass (log(M_* / M_sun) > 10.6) of each quasar host grew in a starburst episode at redshift 7 or 8. One of the targets exhibits little ongoing star formation, as evidenced by the photometric signature of the Balmer break and a lack of spatially resolved H-alpha emission, placing it well below the star formation main sequence at z = 6. The other galaxy is transitioning to a quiescent phase; together, the two galaxies represent the most distant massive post-starburst galaxies known. The maturity of these two galaxies is further supported by the stellar velocity dispersions of their host galaxies, placing them slightly above the upper end of the local M_BH - sigma_* relation. The properties of our two post-starburst galaxies, each hosting an active SMBH with log(M_BH / M_sun) > 9, suggests that black holes played a major role in shaping the formation of the first massive galaxies in the Universe.         |

|**Abstract**|            K2-2 b/HIP 116454 b, the first exoplanet discovery by K2 during its Two-Wheeled Concept Engineering Test, is a sub-Neptune (2.5 $\pm$ 0.1 $R_\oplus$, 9.7 $\pm$ 1.2 $M_\oplus$) orbiting a relatively bright (KS = 8.03) K-dwarf on a 9.1 day period. Unfortunately, due to a spurious follow-up transit detection and ephemeris degradation, the transit ephemeris for this planet was lost. In this work, we recover and refine the transit ephemeris for K2-2 b, showing a $\sim40{\sigma}$ discrepancy from the discovery results. To accurately measure the transit ephemeris and update the parameters of the system, we jointly fit space-based photometric observations from NASA's K2, TESS, and Spitzer missions with new photometric observations from the ground, as well as radial velocities from HARPS-N that are corrected for stellar activity using a new modeling technique. Ephemerides becoming lost or significantly degraded, as is the case for most transiting planets, highlights the importance of systematically updating transit ephemerides with upcoming large efforts expected to characterize hundreds of exoplanet atmospheres. K2-2 b sits at the high-mass peak of the known radius valley for sub-Neptunes, and is now well-suited for transmission spectroscopy with current and future facilities. Our updated transit ephemeris will ensure no more than a 13-minute uncertainty through 2030.         |
