|**Abstract**| The iMaNGA project uses a forward-modelling approach to compare the predictions of cosmological simulations with observations from SDSS-IV/MaNGA. We investigate the dependency of age and metallicity radial gradients on galaxy morphology, stellar mass, stellar surface mass density ($\Sigma_*$), and environment. The key of our analysis is that observational biases affecting the interpretation of MaNGA data are emulated in the theoretical iMaNGA sample. The simulations reproduce the observed global stellar population scaling relations with positive correlations between galaxy mass and age/metallicity quite well and also produce younger stellar populations in late-type in agreement with observations. We do find interesting discrepancies, though, that can inform the physics and further development of the simulations. Ages of spiral galaxies and low-mass ellipticals are overestimated by about 2-4 Gyr. Radial metallicity gradients are steeper in iMaNGA than in MaNGA, a discrepancy most prominent in spiral and lenticular galaxies. Also, the observed steepening of metallicity gradients with increasing galaxy mass is not well matched by the simulations. We find that the theoretical radial profiles of surface mass density $\Sigma_*$ are steeper than in observations except for the most massive galaxies. In both MaNGA and iMaNGA [Z/H] correlates with $\Sigma_*$, however, the simulations systematically predict lower [Z/H] by almost a factor of 2 at any $\Sigma_*$. Most interestingly, for galaxies with stellar mass $\log M_*\leq 10.80 M_\odot$ the MaNGA data reveal a positive correlation between galaxy radius and [Z/H] at fixed $\Sigma_*$, which is not recovered in iMaNGA. Finally, the dependence on environmental density is negligible in both the theoretical iMaNGA and the observed MaNGA data. |

|**Abstract**| We present AspGap, a new approach to infer stellar labels from low-resolution Gaia XP spectra, including precise [$\alpha$/M] estimates for the first time. AspGap is a neural-network based regression model trained on APOGEE spectra. In the training step, AspGap learns to use XP spectra not only to predict stellar labels but also the high-resolution APOGEE spectra that lead to the same stellar labels. The inclusion of this last model component -- dubbed the hallucinator -- creates a more physically motivated mapping and significantly improves the prediction of stellar labels in the validation, particularly of [$\alpha$/M]. For giant stars, we find cross-validated rms accuracies for Teff, log g, [M/H], [$\alpha$/M] of ~1%, 0.12 dex, 0.07 dex, 0.03 dex, respectively. We also validate our labels through comparison with external datasets and through a range of astrophysical tests that demonstrate that we are indeed determining [$\alpha$/M] from the XP spectra, rather than just inferring it indirectly from correlations with other labels. We publicly release the AspGap codebase, along with our stellar parameter catalog for all giants observed by Gaia XP. AspGap enables new insights into the formation and chemo-dynamics of our Galaxy by providing precise [$\alpha$/M] estimates for 23 million giant stars, including 12 million with radial velocities from Gaia. |

|**Abstract**| Starting from the Gaia DR3 HR diagram, we derive the star formation history (SFH) as a function of distance from the Galactic Plane within a cylinder centred on the Sun with a 200~pc radius and spanning 1.3~kpc above and below the Galaxy's midplane. We quantify both the concentration of the more recent star formation in the Galactic Plane, and the age-related increase in the scale height of the Galactic Disc stellar component, which is well-described by power-laws with indices ranging from $1/2$ to $2/3$. The vertically-integrated star formation rate falls from $(1.147 \pm 0.039)\times10^{-8}\, \text{M}_{\odot} \text{yr}^{-1} \text{pc}^{-2}$ at earlier times down to $(6.2 \pm 3.0) \times10^{-9}\, \text{M}_{\odot} \text{yr}^{-1} \text{pc}^{-2}$ at present times, but we find a significant peak of star formation in the 2 to 3 Gyr age bin. The total mass of stars formed per unit area over time is $118.7 \pm 6.2\, \text{M}_{\odot} \text{pc}^{-2}$, which is nearly twice the present stellar mass derived from kinematics within 1~kpc from the Galactic Plane, implying a high degree of matter recycling in successive generations of stars. The method is then modified by adopting an age-dependent correlation between the SFH across the different slices, which results in less noisy and more symmetrical results without significantly changing the previously mentioned quantities. This appears to be a promising way to improve SFH recovery in external galaxies. |
