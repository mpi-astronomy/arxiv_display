|**Abstract**|            Shock chemistry is an excellent tool to shed light on the formation and destruction mechanisms of complex organic molecules (COMs). The L1157-mm outflow is the only low-mass protostellar outflow that has extensively been studied in this regard. Using the data taken as part of the PRODIGE (PROtostars & DIsks: Global Evolution) large program, we aim to map COM emission and derive the molecular composition of the protostellar outflow driven by the Class 0 protostar NGC1333 IRAS4B1 to introduce it as a new laboratory to study the impact of shocks on COM chemistry. In addition to typical outflow tracers such as SiO and CO, outflow emission is seen from H2CO, HNCO, and HC3N, as well as from the COMs CH3OH, CH3CN, and CH3CHO, and even from deuterated species such as DCN, D2CO, and CH2DOH. Maps of integrated intensity ratios between CH3OH and DCN, D2CO, and CH3CHO reveal gradients with distance from the protostar. Intensity ratio maps of HC3N and CH3CN with respect to CH3OH peak in the southern lobe where temperatures are highest. Rotational temperatures derived towards two positions, one in each lobe, are found in the range ~50-100 K. Abundances with respect to CH3OH are higher by factors of a few than for the L1157-B1. In conclusion, for the first time, we securely detected the COMs CH3CN, CH3CHO, and CH2DOH in the IRAS 4B1 outflow, serendipitously with limited sensitivity and bandwidth. Targeted observations will enable the discovery of new COMs and a more detailed analysis of their emission. Morphological differences between molecules in the IRAS 4B1 outflow lobes and their relative abundances provide first proof that this outflow is a promising new laboratory for shock chemistry, which will offer crucial information on COM formation and destruction as well as outflow structure and kinematics.         |

|**Abstract**|            We investigate the detection and nature of 5.6~\mu m MIRI-red sources in the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS), covering 2.4~arcmin$^2$ in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. MIDIS is the deepest JWST/MIRI survey to date, probing faint limits and enabling studies of rare high-redshift galaxy populations. We define MIRI-red sources as those detected at 5$\sigma$ significance in MIRI/F560W with red colors: $m_{\rm F444W} - m_{\rm F560W} \ge 0.5$. Using an empirical methodology, we estimate the purity and completeness of MIRI detections and find that a 5-sigma detection at 28.75 mag has a purity of 92\% and completeness of 54\%. We identify seven MIRI-red galaxy candidates, including an F115W dropout consistent with a high-redshift galaxy candidate. We explore possible physical origins for the MIRI-red population, including active galactic nuclei, dust-obscured galaxies, extreme emission-line galaxies, evolved stellar populations, and Little Red Dots (LRDs). Given the proximity of the F444W and F560W filters and the depth of MIDIS, MIRI-red galaxies are consistent with emission-line galaxies with $EW_0(H\alpha) \ge 750$ Å or $EW_0(H\beta + [OIII]) \ge 600$ Å, or high-redshift Balmer breaks of at least 1.6. We also discuss an extreme MIRI-red galaxy undetected in F444W, a potential MIRI-only source, for which we derive $EW_0(H\alpha) \sim 6000$ Å and $EW_0(H\beta + [OIII]) \sim 4000$ Å, or high-$z$ LRD analogs with Balmer breaks of 6.3. Finally, we find fewer MIRI-red detections than expected from extrapolations of the H$\alpha$ or H$\beta$+[OIII] line luminosity functions, consistent with previous deep searches, while the absence of $z>10$ LRD candidates agrees with theoretical expectations for the MIDIS volume.         |

|| G. Felicioni, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Matharu</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            UV slopes ($\beta$) are a powerful diagnostics for galaxies at the Epoch of Reionization, tracing star formation, ISM ionization, and the escape fraction $f_{esc}$ of ionizing photons. Studies at low and intermediate z find a gradual $\beta$ reddening with time and steeper slopes for fainter galaxies, however recent JWST studies reveal a flattening of this trend at $z>7$. We want measure $\beta$ for galaxies at $z>7.5$ using the strong lensing around massive galaxy clusters to observe high-redshift and faint galaxies. The low-brightness regime is of particular interest for reionization, as most of the recent models of this process posit that numerous faint galaxies are the prime drivers of reionization. We use NIRCam and NIRSpec data from CANUCS, Technicolor, JUMPS, Silver Bullet, UNCOVER and MEGASCIENCE across 7 strong lensing fields. We find galaxies down to $M_{UV}\sim-16$ and 7.5<z<12.5. We measure \b{eta} with a forward-modelling procedure and estimate $f_{esc}$ for a subsample with emission line data using a relation, calibrated from a low-z sample, with UV slope, galaxy size and H$\beta$ equivalent width. We find 378 galaxies (45 with spectrum), yielding average values $\beta=-2.3\pm0.4$, $z=8.5\pm1.0$, and $M_{UV}=-18\pm1$. We find no significant $\beta$ evolution across our redshift range, suggesting a flattening of the $\beta-z$ trend above $z\sim7.5$. We find a weak negative trend between $\beta$ and $M_{UV}$. For 14 galaxies we estimate an average $f_{esc}=0.26\pm0.22$. The flat trend of $\beta$ at $z>7.5$ suggests similar properties between $300$ and $600 Myr$ after the Big Bang. The weak trend between $\beta$ and $M_{UV}$ suggests an analogous composition for low- and high-mass galaxies' ISM, likely due to a lack of time for dust buildup. While average $f_{esc}$ is higher than necessary to ionize the IGM by z~6, the model extrapolated at low-z may overestimate its value.         |

|**Abstract**|            We investigate the azimuthal dependence of H I and O VI-bearing gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of 113 isolated galaxies in the redshift range 0.12 < z < 0.75, including 91 new measurements from the MUSE Quasar-fields Blind Emitters Survey (MUSEQuBES). The H I covering fraction (k_HI) within the virial radius (Rvir) of low-mass (7 < log10(M*/Msun)< 9) galaxies, for a threshold column density of log10(N(HI)/cm^-2) = 14.5, exhibits an enhancement along both the disk plane (azimuthal angle phi < 20 degree) and in the polar direction (phi > 70 degree). In contrast, such a bimodal distribution is not observed for higher mass galaxies (9 < log10(M*/Msun) < 11.3). Similarly, the O VI covering fraction (k_OVI), for a threshold of log10(N(OVI)/cm^-2) = 14.0, shows a tentative enhancement along both the projected major and minor axes for low-mass galaxies. In contrast, O VI-bearing gas around higher- mass galaxies appears more uniformly distributed, with no significant azimuthal dependence. Finally, using the halo circular-velocity-normalized pixel-velocity two-point correlation function (TPCF), we find that O VI absorbers are kinematically narrower along the disk plane compared to the polar directions of the host galaxies with similar stellar mass distributions. The observed isotropic distribution of O VI in high-mass halos suggests that its spatial distribution is governed by global halo properties; however, the O VI kinematics retain memory of the site of origin.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the results of the Exploration of Local VolumE Survey - Field (ELVES-Field), a survey of the dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume (LV; $D<10$ Mpc) over roughly $3,000$ square degrees, focusing on the field dwarf population. Candidates are detected using a semi-automated algorithm tailored for low surface brightness dwarfs. Using tests with injected galaxies, we show the detection is $50\%$ complete to $m_g\sim20$ mag and $M_\star \sim 10^6$ $M_\odot$. Candidates are confirmed to be true nearby dwarfs through distance measurements including redshift, tip of the red giant branch, and surface brightness fluctuations. We identify isolated, field dwarfs using various environmental criteria. Over the survey footprint, we detect and confirm 95 LV dwarfs, 44 of which we consider isolated. Using this sample, we infer the field dwarf mass function and find good agreement at the high-mass end with previous redshift surveys and with the predictions of the IllustrisTNG simulation. This sample of isolated, field dwarfs represents a powerful dataset to investigate aspects of small-scale structure and the effect of environment on dwarf galaxy evolution.         |

|**Abstract**|            We use a new sample of low-mass ($M_* < 10^9$ $M_\odot$) isolated galaxies from the Exploration of Local VolumE Survey - Field (ELVES-Field) to examine the star formation properties and sizes of field dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume (LV; $D<10$ Mpc). This volume-limited sample was selected from nearly 3,000 square degrees of imaging, relying on surface brightness fluctuations to determine distances to the majority of the systems and is complete to $M_* \approx 10^6$ $M_\odot$. Across the surveyed area, we catalog over 2300 candidate LV dwarfs, of which we confirm 95 as genuine LV members and reject over 1600 as background contaminants, with the remaining 600 candidates still requiring a distance measurement. Of the confirmed LV dwarfs, 46 are either new discoveries or confirmed via a distance measurement for the first time here. We explore different environmental criteria to select isolated dwarfs but primarily focus on dwarfs that are $>2\times R_{\mathrm{vir}}$ in projection from any known group with $M_\star > 10^9$ $M_\odot$. We find that, at higher dwarf masses ($M_\star \gtrsim 10^7$ $M_\odot$), essentially all field dwarfs are star-forming as has been found before. In contrast, at $M_\star \lesssim 10^7$ $M_\odot$, $\sim30\%$ of field dwarfs appear to be quenched. Finally, we find that isolated dwarfs are noticeably smaller ($\sim 20\%$) than satellite dwarfs of the same stellar mass, regardless of quenched status.         |

|**Abstract**|            The gravitational wave (GW) event S250206dm, as the first well-localized neutron star merger candidate potentially located in the mass gap, presented a unique opportunity to probe the electromagnetic signatures from such a system. Here we report a deep, multiband search with the new 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST), covering about 64% of the localization region up to a 5-sigma limiting magnitude of 23 mag. In total, 12 potential candidates have been identified while none of them are likely related to S250206dm. This non-detection provides the most stringent constraint to date on any associated kilonova. Crucially, an AT 2017gfo-like event at 269 Mpc can be excluded by WFST observations alone. Based on ejecta mass limits, a neutron star-black hole with a large mass ratio (Q >= 3.2) is disfavored. This optical-derived constraint on the mass ratio reaches, for the first time, a precision comparable to that inferred from the GW signal. This work presents the best observation of this type of events until now, and demonstrates the power of rapid, deep follow-up observations to constrain the properties of compact binary progenitors, offering key insights into the constituents of the mass gap.         |

|**Abstract**|            The detection limit of astronomical imaging observations is limited by several noise sources. Some of that noise is correlated between neighbouring image pixels and exposures, so in principle could be learned and corrected. We present an astronomical self-supervised transformer-based denoising algorithm (ASTERIS), that integrates spatiotemporal information across multiple exposures. Benchmarking on mock data indicates that ASTERIS improves detection limits by 1.0 magnitude at 90% completeness and purity, while preserving the point spread function and photometric accuracy. Observational validation using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Subaru telescope identifies previously undetectable features, including low-surface-brightness galaxy structures and gravitationally-lensed arcs. Applied to deep JWST images, ASTERIS identifies three times more redshift > 9 galaxy candidates, with rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity 1.0 magnitude fainter, than previous methods.         |
