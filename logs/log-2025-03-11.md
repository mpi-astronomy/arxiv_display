|**Abstract**|            The level of dust vertical settling and radial dust concentration in disks is of critical importance for understanding the efficiency of planet formation. We present the first uniform analysis of the vertical extent of millimeter dust for a representative sample of 33disks. We used radiative transfer modeling of archival high-angular-resolution (<=0.1") ALMA dust observations of inclined and ringed disks to estimate their vertical dust scale height, which was compared to estimated gas scale heights to characterize the level of vertical sedimentation. In all 23systems for which constraints could be obtained, we find that the outer parts of the disks are vertically settled. 5disks allow for the characterization of the dust scale height both within and outside approximately half the dust disk radius, showing a lower limit on their dust heights at smaller radii. This implies that the ratio between vertical turbulence and the Stokes number, $\alpha_z/\St$, decreases radially in these sources. For 21rings in 15disks, we also constrained the level of radial concentration of the dust, finding that about half of the rings are compatible with strong radial trapping. In most of these rings, vertical turbulence is found to be comparable to or weaker than radial turbulence, which is incompatible with the turbulence generated by the vertical shear instability at these locations. We further used our dust settling constraints to estimate the turbulence level under the assumption that the dust size is limited by fragmentation, finding typical upper limits around $\alpha_\text{frag}\leq10^{-3}$. In a few sources, we find that turbulence cannot be the main source of accretion. In the context of pebble accretion, we identify several disk regions that have upper limits on their dust concentration that would allow core formation to proceed efficiently, even at wide orbital distances outside of 50au.         |

|**Abstract**|            The spatial correlation between galaxies and the Ly$\alpha$ forest provides insights into how galaxies reionized the Universe. Here, we present initial results on the spatial cross-correlation between [OIII] emitters and Ly$\alpha$ forest at 5.4<z<6.5 from the JWST ASPIRE NIRCam/F356W Grism Spectroscopic Survey in z>6.5 QSO fields. Using data from five QSO fields, we find $2\sigma$ evidence for excess Ly$\alpha$ forest transmission at ~20-40 cMpc around [OIII] emitters at z=5.86, indicating that [OIII] emitters reside within a highly ionized IGM. At smaller scales, the Ly$\alpha$ forest is preferentially absorbed, suggesting gas overdensities around [OIII] emitters. Comparing with models including THESAN simulations, we interpret the observed cross-correlation as evidence for significant large-scale fluctuations of the IGM and the late end of reionization at z<6, characterized by ionized bubbles over 50 cMpc around [OIII] emitters. The required UV background necessitates an unseen population of faint galaxies around the [OIII] emitters. Furthermore, we find that the number of observed [OIII] emitters near individual transmission spikes is insufficient to sustain reionization in their surroundings, even assuming all [OIII] emitters harbour AGN with 100 % LyC escape fractions. Despite broad agreement, a careful analysis of ASPIRE and THESAN, using the observed host halo mass from the clustering of [OIII] emitters, suggests that the simulations underpredict the observed excess IGM transmission around [OIII] emitters, challenging our model of reionization. Potential solutions include larger ionized bubbles at z<6, more enhanced large-scale UV background or temperature fluctuations of the IGM, and possibly a patchy early onset of reionization at z>10. Current observational errors are dominated by cosmic variance, meaning future analyses of more QSO fields from JWST will improve the results.         |

|**Abstract**|            Intracluster light (ICL) provides a record of the dynamical interactions undergone by clusters, giving clues on cluster formation and evolution. Here, we analyse the properties of ICL in the massive cluster Abell 2390 at redshift z=0.228. Our analysis is based on the deep images obtained by the Euclid mission as part of the Early Release Observations in the near-infrared (Y, J, H bands), using the NISP instrument in a 0.75 deg$^2$ field. We subtracted a point--spread function (PSF) model and removed the Galactic cirrus contribution in each band after modelling it with the DAWIS software. We then applied three methods to detect, characterise, and model the ICL and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG): the CICLE 2D multi-galaxy fitting; the DAWIS wavelet-based multiscale software; and a mask-based 1D profile fitting. We detect ICL out to 600 kpc. The ICL fractions derived by our three methods range between 18% and 36% (average of 24%), while the BCG+ICL fractions are between 21% and 41% (average of 29%), depending on the band and method. A galaxy density map based on 219 selected cluster members shows a strong cluster substructure to the south-east and a smaller feature to the north-west. Based on colours, the ICL (out to about 400 kpc) seems to be built by the accretion of small systems (M ~ $10^{9.5}$ solar mass), or from stars coming from the outskirts of Milky Way-type galaxies (M ~ $10^{10}$ solar mass). Though Abell 2390 does not seem to be undergoing a merger, it is not yet fully relaxed, since it has accreted two groups that have not fully merged with the cluster core. We estimate that the contributions to the inner 300 kpc of the ICL of the north-west and south-east subgroups are 21% and 9% respectively.         |

|**Abstract**|            Type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb) often exhibit an early light curve excess (EE) preceding the main peak powered by radioactive nickel decay. The physical origin of this early emission remains an open question. Among the proposed scenarios, shock cooling emission-resulting from the interaction between the shockwave and extended envelopes-is considered the most plausible mechanism. The frequency of these events remains unconstrained. This study aims to quantify the frequency of EE in SNe IIb and investigate its physical origin by analyzing optical light curves from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey. We selected 74 SNe IIb from 153 spectroscopically classified events in the Transient Name Server (TNS) database, observed by ATLAS, with peak fluxes exceeding 150 {\mu}Jy and explosion epoch uncertainties lower than six days. Using light curve model fitting and outlier analysis, we identified SNe IIb exhibiting EE and analyzed their photometric properties. We found 21 SNe IIb with EE, corresponding to a frequency of approximately 28-40%, with the higher value obtained under the most stringent data cuts. The EE's duration and color evolution are consistent with shock cooling in extended hydrogen-rich envelopes. We also found that EE SNe IIb have longer rise times and faster post-peak decline rates than non-EE SNe IIb, while both groups share similar peak absolute magnitudes. Our findings suggest that EE and non-EE SNe IIb likely share similar initial progenitor masses but differ in ejecta mass properties, potentially due to varying degrees of binary interaction. This study provides constraints on the evolutionary pathways of SNe IIb progenitors as compact stars with and without extended hydrogen envelopes.         |
