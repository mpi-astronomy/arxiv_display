|**Abstract**|            Light curves represent astronomical time series of flux measured across one or more photometric bands. With the rapid growth of large-scale sky surveys, time-domain astronomy has become an essential area of modern astrophysical research. Interactive visualization of extensive light-curve datasets plays a key role in exploring transient phenomena and in planning large follow-up campaigns. In this work, we introduce two web-based platforms designed for interactive light-curve visualization: Fulu, for transient event studies, and VALC, for investigations of low-mass active galactic nuclei (AGNs). These tools provide a user-friendly interface for examining, comparing, and interpreting vast collections of astronomical light curves, supporting scientific discovery.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Euclid mission seeks to understand the Universe expansion history and the nature of dark energy, which requires a very accurate estimate of redshift distribution. Achieving this accuracy relies on reference samples with spectroscopic redshifts, together with a procedure to match them to survey sources for which only photometric redshifts are available. One important source of systematic uncertainty is the mismatch in photometric properties between galaxies in the Euclid survey and the reference objects. We develop a method to degrade the photometry of objects with deep photometry to match the properties of any shallower survey in the multi-band photometric space, preserving all the correlations between the fluxes and their uncertainties. We compare our transfer method with more demanding image-based methods, such as Balrog from the Dark Energy Survey Collaboration. According to metrics, our method outperforms Balrog. We implement it in the redshift distribution reconstruction, based on the self-organising map approach of arXiv:1509.03318, and test it using a realistic sample from the Euclid Flagship Simulation. We find that the key ingredient is to ensure that the reference objects are distributed in the colour space the same way as the wide-survey objects, which can be efficiently achieved with our transfer method. In our best implementation, the mean redshift biases are consistently reduced across the tomographic bins, bringing a significant fraction of them within the Euclid accuracy requirements in all tomographic bins. Equally importantly, the tests allow us to pinpoint which step in the calibration pipeline has the strongest impact on achieving the required accuracy. Our approach also reproduces the overall redshift distributions, which are crucial for applications such as angular clustering.         |

|**Abstract**|            Over the past decade, ALMA has uncovered a range of substructures within exoKuiper belts, pointing to a population of undetected planets. With JWST's sensitivity, we now have the opportunity to identify these planets thought to be responsible for the observed substructures in debris discs. We present Cycle 1 JWST/MIRI 11.4 {\mu}m coronagraphic observations of three exoKuiper belts that exhibit gaps in their radial structures: HD 92945, HD 107146, and HD 206893, to determine whether planets are responsible for carving these structures, as seen in our Solar System with the gas giants. We reduce the JWST/MIRI data using spaceKLIP, and introduce new routines to mitigate the Brighter-Fatter effect and persistence. We do not detect any planet candidates, and all detected objects in the field-of-view are consistent with background stars or galaxies. However, by combining JWST mass limits, archival observational constraints, and astrometric accelerations, we rule out a significant portion of planet parameter space, placing tight constraints on the planets possibly responsible for these gaps. To interpret these results, we explore multiple gap-carving scenarios in discs, either massless or with non-zero mass, including clearing by in-situ planet(s), as well as shaping by inner planets through mean-motion or secular apsidal resonances. Finally, we conclude that the planets causing the proper motion anomaly in these systems must reside within the inner 20 au.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present JWST/NIRSpec high-cadence infrared spectroscopy of three long-period, eclipsing AM CVn binaries, Gaia14aae, SRGeJ0453, and ZTFJ1637. These systems have orbital periods of 50-62 minutes and cool donors that are undetectable in the optical. The data cover a wavelength range of 1.6-5.2 $\mu$m at resolution $R=1000-2000$. We obtained 150-200 spectra of each system over two orbits, split between the G235M and G395M gratings. All three systems show strong, double-peaked He I emission lines dominated by an accretion disk. These lines are nearly stationary but contain radial velocity (RV) variable sub-components that trace stream-disk interactions. In Gaia14aae and SRGeJ0453, we detect two Na I doublets in emission whose RVs track the irradiated face of the donor, marking the first direct detection of the donors of long-period AM CVns. No absorption lines from the donors are detected, implying that the IR excesses observed in many long-period AM CVns primarily trace disks, not donors. The He I emission profiles in all systems lack high-velocity wings and show no emission beyond $\approx 1500,\rm km,s^{-1}$. The morphology of the disk eclipses and Doppler tomograms are best reproduced by models in which the disk is truncated well outside the white dwarf and only material at $r \gtrsim 0.07,R_{\odot}$ contributes to the disk emission. We interpret this as possible evidence of magnetized white dwarf accretors. For plausible mass transfer rates, the truncation radii imply surface magnetic fields of $B = 30-100$ kG, consistent with recent constraints based on X-ray periodicity. The absence of cyclotron humps out to 5 $\mu$m rules out stronger MG-level fields. We make the data from the program publicly available to the community.         |
