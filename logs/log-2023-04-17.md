|**Abstract**| Gaia EDR3 has provided unprecedented data that generate a lot of interest in the astrophysical community, despite the fact that systematics affect the reported parallaxes at the level of ~ 10 muas. Independent distance measurements are available from asteroseismology of red-giant stars with measurable parallaxes, whose magnitude and colour ranges more closely reflect those of other stars of interest. In this paper, we determine distances to nearly 12,500 red-giant branch and red clump stars observed by Kepler, K2, and TESS. This is done via a grid-based modelling method, where global asteroseismic observables, constraints on the photospheric chemical composition, and on the unreddened photometry are used as observational inputs. This large catalogue of asteroseismic distances allows us to provide a first comparison with Gaia EDR3 parallaxes. Offset values estimated with asteroseismology show no clear trend with ecliptic latitude or magnitude, and the trend whereby they increase (in absolute terms) as we move towards redder colours is dominated by the brightest stars. The correction model proposed by Lindegren et al. (2021) is not suitable for all the fields considered in this study. We find a good agreement between asteroseismic results and model predictions of the red clump magnitude. We discuss possible trends with the Gaia scan law statistics, and show that two magnitude regimes exist where either asteroseismology or Gaia provides the best precision in parallax. |

|**Abstract**| In this study, we investigate how physical properties, such as the density and temperature profiles, evolve on core scales through the evolutionary sequence during high-mass star formation ranging from protostars in cold infrared dark clouds to evolved UCHII regions. We observed 11 high-mass star-forming regions with ALMA at 3 mm wavelengths. Based on the 3 mm continuum morphology and recombination line emission, tracing locations with free-free (ff) emission, the fragmented cores analyzed in this study are classified into either dust or dust+ff cores. In addition, we resolve three cometary UCHII regions with extended 3 mm emission that is dominated by free-free emission. The temperature structure and radial profiles (T~r^-q ) are determined by modeling molecular emission of CH3CN and CH313CN with XCLASS and by using the HCN-to- HNC intensity ratio as probes for the gas kinetic temperature. The density profiles (n~r^-p ) are estimated from the 3 mm continuum visibility profiles. The masses M and H2 column densities N(H2) are then calculated from the 3 mm dust continuum emission. Results. We find a large spread in mass and peak H2 column density in the detected sources ranging from 0.1-150 Msun and 10^23 - 10^26 cm-2 , respectively. Including the results of the CORE and CORE-extension studies (Gieser et al. 2021, 2022) to increase the sample size, we find evolutionary trends on core scales for the temperature power-~law index q increasing from 0.1 to 0.7 from infrared dark clouds to UCHII regions, while for the the density power-law index p on core scales, we do not find strong evidence for an evolutionary trend. However, we find that on the larger clump scales throughout these evolutionary phases the density profile flattens from p = 2.2 to p = 1.2. (abridged) |

|**Abstract**| We present Magellan/M2FS spectroscopy of four recently discovered Milky Way star clusters (Gran 3, Gran 4, Garro 01, LP 866) and two newly discovered open clusters (Gaia 9, Gaia 10) at low Galactic latitudes. We measure line-of-sight velocities and stellar parameters ([Fe/H], $\log{g}$, $T_{\rm eff}$, [Mg/Fe]) from high resolution spectroscopy centered on the Mg triplet and identify 20-80 members per star cluster. We determine the kinematics and chemical properties of each cluster and measure the systemic proper motion and orbital properties by utilizing Gaia astrometry. We find Gran 3 to be an old, metal-poor (mean metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.84) globular cluster located in the Galactic bulge on a retrograde orbit. Gran 4 is an old, metal-poor ([Fe/H]}=-1.84) globular cluster with a halo-like orbit that happens to be passing through the Galactic plane. The orbital properties of Gran 4 are consistent with the proposed LMS-1/Wukong and/or Helmi streams merger events. Garro 01 is an old, metal-rich ([Fe/H]=-0.30) globular cluster on a near circular orbit in the outer disk. Gaia 9 and Gaia 10 are among the most distant known open clusters at $R_{GC}\sim 18, 21.2~kpc$ and most metal-poor with [Fe/H]~-0.50,-0.46 for Gaia 9 and Gaia 10, respectively. LP 866 is a nearby, metal-rich open cluster ([Fe/H]$=+0.1$). The discovery and confirmation of multiple star clusters in the Galactic plane shows the power of {\it Gaia} astrometry and the star cluster census remains incomplete. |
