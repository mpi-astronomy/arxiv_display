|**Abstract**|            We show with Gaia XP spectroscopy that extremely metal-rich stars in the Milky Way (EMR; $[M/H]_{XP} > 0.5$) - but only those - are largely confined to a tight "knot" at the center of the Galaxy. This EMR knot is round in projection, has a fairly abrupt edge near $\sim 1.5$kpc, and is a dynamically hot system. This central knot also contains very metal-rich (VMR; $+0.2\le [M/H]_{XP} \le +0.4$) stars. However, in contrast to EMR stars, the bulk of VMR stars form an extended, highly flattened distribution in the inner Galaxy ($R_{\mathrm{GC}}\lesssim 5$ kpc). We draw on TNG50 simulations of Milky Way analogs for context and find that compact, metal-rich knots confined to $<1.5$kpc are a universal feature. In typical simulated analogs, the top 5-10% most metal-rich stars are confined to a central knot; however, in our Milky Way data this fraction is only 0.1%. Dust-penetrating wide-area near-infrared spectroscopy, such as SDSS-V, will be needed for a rigorous estimate of the fraction of stars in the Galactic EMR knot. Why in our Milky Way only EMR giants are confined to such a central knot remains to be explained. Remarkably, the central few kiloparsecs of the Milky Way harbor both the highest concentration of metal-poor stars (the `poor old heart') and almost all EMR stars. This highlights the stellar population diversity at the bottom of galactic potential wells.         |

|**Abstract**|            $Context.$ On October 31, 2009, the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) on board the Herschel Space Observatory observed far-infrared spectra of Jupiter between 50 and 220$\,\mu$m as part of the program "Water and Related Chemistry in the Solar System". $Aims.$ We investigate the disk-averaged chemical composition of Jupiter's atmosphere as a function of height using these observations. $Methods.$ We used the Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) and the least-squares fitting technique to infer the abundances of trace constituents. $Results.$ The PACS data include numerous spectral lines attributable to ammonia (NH$_3$), methane (CH$_4$), phosphine (PH$_3$), water (H$_2$O), and deuterated hydrogen (HD) in the Jovian atmosphere. We infer an ammonia abundance profile that decreases from a mole fraction of $(1.7\pm 0.8)\times 10^{-4}$ at $p\sim 900\,$mbar to $(1.7\pm 0.9)\times 10^{-8}$ at $p\sim 275\,$mbar, following a fractional scale height of about 0.114. For phosphine, we find a mole fraction of $(7.2\pm 1.2)\times 10^{-7}$ at pressures higher than $(550\pm 100)\,$mbar and a decrease of its abundance at lower pressures following a fractional scale height of $(0.09\pm 0.02)$. Our analysis delivers a methane mole fraction of $(1.49\pm 0.09)\times 10^{-3}$. Analyzing the HD $R(0)$ line at $112.1\,\mu$m yields a new measurement of Jupiter's D/H ratio, $\text{D/H}=(1.5\pm 0.6)\times 10^{-5}$. Finally, the PACS data allow us to put the most stringent $3\sigma$ upper limits yet on the mole fractions of hydrogen halides in the Jovian troposphere. These new upper limits are $<1.1\times 10^{-11}$ for hydrogen fluoride (HF), $<6.0\times 10^{-11}$ for hydrogen chloride (HCl), $<2.3\times 10^{-10}$ for hydrogen bromide (HBr) and $<1.2\times 10^{-9}$ for hydrogen iodide (HI) and support the proposed condensation of hydrogen halides into ammonium halide salts in the Jovian troposphere.         |

|**Abstract**|            Although supermassive black holes (SMBHs) reside in the heart of virtually every massive galaxy, it remains debated whether dwarf galaxies also commonly host SMBHs. Because low-mass galaxies may retain a memory of the assembly history of their black holes, probing the black hole occupation fraction of local dwarf galaxies might offer insights into the growth and seeding mechanisms of the first black holes. In this work, we exploit the Western half of the eROSITA all-sky survey (covering $20,000~\rm{deg^2}$) and compile a catalog of accreting SMBHs in local ($D<200$~Mpc) dwarf galaxies. After cleaning our sample from cosmic X-ray background sources, X-ray binaries, and ultraluminous X-ray sources, we identify 74 AGN-dwarf galaxy pairs. Using this large and uniform sample, we derive a luminosity function of dwarf galaxy AGN, fitting it with a power law function and obtaining ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}L_{\rm X} = (15.9\pm2.2)\times L_{\rm X}^{-1.63\pm0.05}$. Measuring the offset between the centroid of dwarf galaxies and the X-ray sources, we find that about $50\%$ of the AGN are likely off-nuclear, in agreement with theoretical predictions. We also compare the black hole-to-stellar mass relation of the AGN in our sample with the local and high-redshift relations, finding that our sources better adhere to the former. This suggests that local AGN across different mass scales underwent a similar growth history. Finally, we compare our sources with semi-analytical models: while our sample is too shallow to distinguish between different seeding models, it favors a growth mechanism linked to the star-formation rate of the host galaxy.         |

|**Abstract**|            $\omega$ Centauri, the most massive globular cluster in the Milky Way, has long been suspected to be the stripped nucleus of a dwarf galaxy that fell into the Galaxy a long time ago. There is considerable evidence for this scenario including a large spread in metallicity and an unusually large number of distinct sub-populations seen in photometric studies. In this work, we use new MUSE spectroscopic and HST photometric catalogs to investigate the underlying metallicity distributions as well as the spatial variations of the populations within the cluster up to its half-light radius. Based on 11,050 member stars, the [M/H] distribution has a median of $ (-1.614 \pm 0.003)$ dex and a large spread of $\sim$ 1.37 dex reaching from $ -0.67$ dex to $ -2.04$ dex for 99.7 % of the stars. In addition, we show the chromosome map of the cluster, which separates the red giant branch stars into different sub-populations, and analyze the sub-populations of the metal-poorest component. Finally, we do not find any metallicity gradient within the half-light radius, and the different sub-populations are well mixed.         |

|**Abstract**|            The signal from a transiting planet can be diluted by astrophysical contamination. In the case of circumstellar debris disks, this contamination could start in the mid-infrared and vary as a function of wavelength, which would then change the observed transmission spectrum for any planet in the system. The MIRI/LRS WASP-39b transmission spectrum shows an unexplained dip starting at $\sim$10 $\mu$m that could be caused by astrophysical contamination. The spectral energy distribution displays excess flux at similar levels to that which are needed to create the dip in the transmission spectrum. In this article, we show that this dip is consistent with the presence of a bright circumstellar debris disk, at a distance of $>$2 au. We discuss how a circumstellar debris disk like that could affect the atmosphere of WASP-39b. We also show that even faint debris disks can be a source of contamination in MIRI exoplanet spectra.         |

|**Abstract**|            The main challenge of exoplanet high-contrast imaging (HCI) is to separate the signal of exoplanets from their host stars, which are many orders of magnitude brighter. HCI for ground-based observations is further exacerbated by speckle noise originating from perturbations in the Earth's atmosphere and imperfections in the telescope optics. Various data post-processing techniques are used to remove this speckle noise and reveal the faint planet signal. Often, however, a significant part of the planet signal is accidentally subtracted together with the noise. In the present work, we use explainable machine learning to investigate the reason for the loss of the planet signal for one of the most used post-processing methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We find that PCA learns the shape of the telescope point spread function for high numbers of PCA components. This representation of the noise captures not only the speckle noise, but also the characteristic shape of the planet signal. Building upon these insights, we develop a new post-processing method (4S) that constrains the noise model to minimize this signal loss. We apply our model to 11 archival HCI datasets from the VLT-NACO instrument in the L'-band and find that our model consistently outperforms PCA. The improvement is largest at close separations to the star ($\leq 4 \lambda /D$) providing up to 1.5 magnitudes deeper contrast. This enhancement enables us to detect the exoplanet AF Lep b in data from 2011, 11 years before its subsequent discovery. We present updated orbital parameters for this object.         |

|**Abstract**|            The infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is predicted to displace the inner Milky Way (MW), imprinting an apparent 'reflex motion' on the observed velocities of distant halo stars. We construct the largest all-sky spectroscopic dataset of luminous red giant stars from $50-160$ kpc, including a new survey of the southern celestial hemisphere. We fit the full 6D kinematics of our data to measure the amplitude and direction of the inner MW's motion towards the outer halo. The observed velocity grows with distance such that, relative to halo stars at $100$ kpc, the inner MW is lurching at $\approx 40$ km s$^{-1}$ towards a recent location along the LMC's past orbit. Our measurements align with N-body simulations of the halo's response to a $1.8 \times 10^{11} M_\odot$ LMC on first infall, suggesting that the LMC is at least 15% as massive as the MW. Our findings highlight the dramatic disequilibrium of the MW outskirts, and will enable more accurate measurements of the total mass of our Galaxy.         |
