|**Abstract**|            We analyse jointly phase-curve observations of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-18 b from the visible to the mid-infrared, using unpublished data from CHEOPS, TESS and Spitzer. We aim to characterise the planetary atmosphere with a consistent view over the large wavelength range covered using GCMs and retrieval analyses, and including JWST data. We obtain new ephemerides with unprecedented precisions of 1 second and 1.4 millisecond on the time of inferior conjunction and orbital period, respectively. We compute a planetary radius of $R_p = 1.1926 \pm 0.0077 R_J$ with a precision of 0.65%, or 550 km. Through a timing inconsistency with JWST, we discuss and confirm orbital eccentricity ($e = 0.00852 \pm 0.00091$), and constrain the argument of periastron to $\omega = 261.9^{+1.3}_{-1.4}$ deg. We show that the large dayside emission implies the presence of magnetic drag and super-solar metallicity. We find a steep thermally-inverted gradient in the planetary atmosphere, which is common for UHJs. We detect the presence of strong CO emission lines at 4.5 $\mu$m from an excess of dayside brightness in the Spitzer/IRAC/Ch2 passband. Using these models to constrain the reflected contribution in the CHEOPS passband, we derive an extremely low geometric albedo $A_g^\text{CHEOPS} = 0.027 \pm 0.011$.         |

|**Abstract**|            Neutron star (NS) mergers, including both binary NS mergers and black hole - NS mergers, are multi-messenger sources detectable in both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The expected EM emission signatures depend on the source's progenitor, merger remnant, and observer's line of sight (LoS). Widely discussed EM counterparts of NS mergers have been focused in the gamma-ray (in terms of short-duration gamma-ray bursts) and optical (in terms of kilonova) bands. In this paper, we show that X-ray emission carries unique post-merger signatures that are inaccessible in other EM bands and plays an important role in understanding the physics and geometry of these mergers. We consider several binary progenitor and central engine models and investigate X-ray emission signatures from the prompt phase immediately after the merger to the afterglow phase extending years later. For the prompt phase, we devise a general method for computing phenomenological X-ray light curves and spectra for structured jets viewed from any LoS, which can be applied to X-ray observations of NS mergers to constrain the geometry. The geometric constraints can in turn be used to model the afterglow and estimate a peak time and flux -- to preemptively determine afterglow characteristics would be monumental for follow-up observation campaigns of future GW sources. Finally, we provide constraints on the time window for X-ray counterpart searches of NS mergers across a range of luminosity distances and detector sensitivities.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) is China's upcoming next-generation ultraviolet and optical survey telescope, with imaging resolution capabilities comparable to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). In this study, we utilized a comprehensive sample of 3,679 CSST realistic mock galaxies constructed from HST CANDELS/GOODS-North deep imaging observations, with stellar masses $\log\left(M_{*} / M_{\odot}\right) > 9.0$ and redshifts $z < 2$. We evaluate the detection capabilities of CSST surveys and the accuracy in measuring the non-parametric morphological indicators ($C$, $A$, $Gini$, $M_{\rm 20}$, $A_{\rm O}$, $D_{\rm O}$) of galaxies. Our findings show that in terms of galaxy detection capabilities, CSST's deep field surveys can achieve the same level as HST's deep field observations; however, in wide-field surveys, CSST exhibits a significant deficiency in detecting high-redshift, low-mass, low-surface-brightness galaxies. Regarding the measurement of galaxy morphology, CSST's deep field surveys achieve high accuracy across all indicators except for the asymmetry indicator ($A$), whereas its wide-field surveys suffer from significant systematic biases. We thus provide simple correction functions to adjust the non-parametric morphological indicators obtained from CSST's wide-field and deep-field observations, thereby aligning CSST measurements with those from HST. This adjustment enables the direct application of non-parametric morphological classification methods originally developed for HST data to galaxies observed by CSST.         |

|**Abstract**|            Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are luminous black hole (BH) transient sources, which are detected mainly in X-ray and optical bands. It is generally believed that the X-ray emission in TDEs is produced by an accretion disc formed as the stellar debris accreted onto the central BH. The origin of the optical emission is not determined, but could be explained by the `reprocessing' model with the X-ray emission reprocessed into optical band by a surrounding optically thick envelope or outflow. In this paper, we performed radiation hydrodynamic simulations of super-Eddington accretion flow with Athena++ code in the environment of TDEs, i.e., injecting a continuous mass flow rate at the circularization radius in the form of $\dot M_{\rm inject} \propto t^{-5/3}$ for the mass supply rate. We show that a significant fraction of the matter in the accretion inflow are blowed off forming outflow, and the properties of the outflow are viewing-angle dependent. We further calculate the emergent spectra of such an inflow/outflow system for different viewing angles with the method of Monto Carlo radiative transfer. Based on the emergent spectra, we show that the observed features of TDEs, such as the X-ray and optical luminosities, the blackbody temperature of X-ray and optical emission and the corresponding emission radii, the ratio of X-ray luminosity to optical luminosity, as well as the evolution of these quantities can be explained in the framework of viewing-angle effect of super-Eddington accretion around a BH.         |
