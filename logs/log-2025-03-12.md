|**Abstract**|            Machine-learning is playing an increasing role in helping the astronomical community to face data analysis challenges, in particular in the field of Galactic Archaeology and large scale spectroscopic surveys. We present recent developments in the field of convolutional neural-networks (CNNs) for stellar abundances in the context of the Galactic spectroscopic surveys Gaia-ESO, and Gaia-RVS. Especially, by combining the full Gaia data product, we manage to characterize for the first time the [alpha/M] vs. [M/H] bimodality in the Galactic disc with Gaia-RVS spectra at low-S/N. This work is highly relevant for the next generation of large scale surveys such as MSE, 4MOST, and WST.         |

|**Abstract**|            T CrA is a Herbig Ae-type young star in a complex circumstellar environment; it includes a circumstellar disk, accretion streamers, jets, and outflows. It has long been suspected to be a binary. However, until now, there has been no direct detection of a companion. Here we present new VLTI/MATISSE L- and N-band observations of T CrA taken between 2023 May and 2024 August with the aim of testing the binary nature of the system. We modeled the data with a geometric model using the Python tool oimodeler. We detected a companion (T CrA B) with a projected separation of $\Delta r = 153.2 \pm 1.2$ mas ($\approx 23$ au) toward the west direction at a position angle of $275.4 \pm 0.1^\circ$, in 2024 May-August. Our results support that the companion has a nearly edge-on orbit that is highly misaligned with respect to the circumprimary disk. Such a configuration could cause warping and tearing of the disk around the primary, which has been proposed by recent studies. In the L band the companion is extended, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) size of $\sim 1$ au, suggesting that the emission comes from a disk around the secondary star. The companion flux is 0.2-0.3 Jy in the L band, and 0.2-0.7 Jy in the N band, accounting for 4-20% of the total emission at those wavelengths. The SED of the companion is compatible with thermal radiation of warm dust (600-800 K).         |

|| N. Hurley-Walker, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-03-12*|
|*Comments*| *4 main figures, 9 extended figures*|
|**Abstract**|            The high-frequency radio sky is bursting with synchrotron transients from massive stellar explosions and accretion events, but the low-frequency radio sky has so far been quiet beyond the Galactic pulsar population and the long-term scintillation of AGN. The low-frequency band, however, is sensitive to exotic coherent and polarised radio emission processes such as electron cyclotron maser emission from flaring M-dwarfs [1], stellar magnetospheric plasma interactions with exoplanets [2], and a population of steep-spectrum pulsars [3], making Galactic plane searches a prospect for blind transient discovery. Here we report an analysis of archival low-frequency radio data that reveals a periodic, low-frequency radio transient. We find that the source pulses every 18.18 minutes, an unusual periodicity not previously observed. The emission is highly linearly polarised, bright, persists for 30--60 s on each occurrence, and is visible across a broad frequency range. At times the pulses comprise short ($<0.5$-s) duration bursts; at others, a smoother profile is observed. These profiles evolve on timescales of hours. By measuring the dispersion of the radio pulses with respect to frequency, we have localised the source to within our own Galaxy, and suggest that it could be an ultra-long period magnetar.         |

|| <mark>J. Li</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-03-12*|

|**Abstract**|            The Taurid Complex is a large interplanetary system that contains comet 2P/Encke, several meteoroid streams, and possibly a number of near-Earth asteroids. The size and nature of the system has led to the speculation that it was formed through a large-scale cometary breakup. Numerical investigations have suggested that planetary dynamics can create a resonant region with a large number of objects concentrated in a small segment of the orbit, known as the Taurid swarm, which approaches the Earth in certain years and provides favorable conditions to study the Taurid Complex. Recent meteor observations confirmed the existence of the swarm for mm- to m-sized objects. Here we present a dedicated telescopic search for potentially hazardous asteroids and other macroscopic objects in the Taurid swarm using the Zwicky Transient Facility survey. We determine from our non-detection that there are no more than 9--14 $H\leq24$ (equivalent to a diameter of $D\gtrsim100$~m) objects in the swarm, suggesting that the Encke--Taurid progenitor was $\sim10$~km in size. A progenitor of such a size is compatible with the prediction of state-of-the-art Solar System dynamical models, which expects $\sim0.1$ $D>10$~km objects on Encke-like orbits at any given time.         |
