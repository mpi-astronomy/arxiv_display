|**Abstract**|            The dearth of high quality spectroscopy of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) -- the main drivers of the assembly of dust and stellar mass at the peak of activity in the Universe -- greatly hinders our ability to interpret their physical processes and evolutionary pathways. We present JWST/NIRSpec observations from RUBIES of four submillimeter-selected, ALMA-detected DSFGs at cosmic noon, $z\sim2.3-2.7$. While photometry uniformly suggests vigorous ongoing star formation for the entire sample in line with canonical DSFGs, the spectra differ: one source has spectroscopic evidence of an evolved stellar population, indicating a recent transition to a post-starburst phase, while the remainder show strong spectroscopic signatures of ongoing starbursts. All four galaxies are infrared-luminous (log$_{10}$$L_{\rm{IR}}$/L$_{\rm \odot}$ $>12.4$), massive (log$_{10}\,M_\star$/M$_{\rm \odot}$ $>11$), and very dust-obscured ($A_V\sim3-4$ ABmag). Leveraging detections of multiple Balmer and Paschen lines, we derive an optical attenuation curve consistent with Calzetti overall, yet an optical extinction ratio $R_V\sim2.5$, potentially indicating smaller dust grains or differences in star-dust geometry. This case study provides some of the first detailed spectroscopic evidence that the DSFGs encompass a heterogeneous sample spanning a range of star formation properties and evolutionary stages, and illustrates the advantages of synergistic JWST and ALMA analysis of DSFGs.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Gum Nebula is a faint supernova remnant extending about 40 degrees across the southern sky, potentially affecting tens of background pulsars. Though the view that the Gum Nebula acts as a potential scattering screen for background pulsars has been recurrently mentioned over the past five decades, it has not been directly confirmed. We chose the strong background pulsar PSR~B0740$-$28 as a probe and monitored its diffractive interstellar scintillation (DISS) at 2.25~$\&$~8.60~GHz simultaneously for about two years using the Shanghai Tian Ma Radio Telescope (TMRT). DISS was detected at both frequencies and quantified by two-dimensional autocorrelation analysis. We calculated their scattering spectral index $\alpha$ and found that 9/21 of the observations followed the theoretical predictions, while 4/21 of them clearly showed $\alpha < 4$. This finding provides strong support for anomalous scattering along the pulsar line of sight, due to the large frequency lever arm and the simultaneous features of our dual-frequency observations. In comparison to the 2.25~GHz observations, scintillation arcs were observed in 10/21 of the secondary spectrum plots for 8.60~GHz observations. Consequently, the highest frequency record for pulsar scintillation arc detection was updated to 8.60~GHz. Our fitting results were the most direct evidence for the view that the Gum Nebula acts as the scattering screen for background pulsars, because both the distance ($245^{+69}_{-72}$~pc) and transverse speed ($22.4^{+4.1}_{-4.2}$~km/s) of the scintillation screen are comparable with related parameters of the Gum Nebula. Our findings indicated that anisotropic scattering provides a superior explanation for the annual modulation of scintillation arcs than isotropic scattering. Additionally, the orientation of its long axis was also fitted.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS), a Cycle 1 JWST imaging programme exploiting the wavelength coverage and sensitivity of NIRCam to extend narrow-band rest-optical emission line selection into the epoch of reionization (EoR) for the first time, and to enable unique studies of the resolved ionised gas morphology in individual galaxies across cosmic history. The primary JELS observations comprise $\sim4.7\mu$m narrow-band imaging over $\sim63$ arcmin$^{2}$ designed to enable selection of H$\alpha$ emitters at $z\sim6.1$, as well as the selection of a host of novel emission-line samples including [OIII] at $z\sim8.3$ and Pa $\alpha/\beta$ at $z\sim1.5/2.8$. For the prime F466N and F470N narrow-band observations, the emission-line sensitivities achieved are up to $\sim2\times$ more sensitive than current slitless spectroscopy surveys (5$\sigma$ limits of 1.1-1.6$\times10^{-18}\text{erg s}^{-1}\text{cm}^{-2}$), corresponding to unobscured H$\alpha$ star-formation rates (SFRs) of 1-1.6 $\text{M}_{\odot}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ at $z\sim6.1$ and extending emission-line selections in the EoR to fainter populations. Simultaneously, JELS also obtained F200W broadband and F212N narrow-band imaging (H$\alpha$ at $z\sim2.23$) that probes SFRs $\gtrsim5\times$ fainter than previous ground-based narrow-band studies ($\sim0.2 \text{M}_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}$), offering an unprecedented resolved view of star formation at cosmic noon. In this paper we describe the detailed JELS survey design, key data processing steps specific to the survey observations, and demonstrate the exceptional data quality and imaging sensitivity achieved. We then summarise the key scientific goals of JELS and present some early science results, including examples of spectroscopically confirmed H$\alpha$ and [OIII] emitters discovered by JELS that illustrate the novel parameter space probed.         |

|**Abstract**|            In the context of the GRAVITY+ upgrade, the adaptive optics (AO) systems of the GRAVITY interferometer are undergoing a major lifting. The current CILAS deformable mirrors (DM, 90 actuators) will be replaced by ALPAO kilo-DMs (43x43, 1432 actuators). On top of the already existing 9x9 Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors (SH-WFS) for infrared (IR) natural guide star (NGS), new 40x40 SH-WFSs for visible (VIS) NGS will be deployed. Lasers will also be installed on the four units of the Very Large Telescope to provide a laser guide star (LGS) option with 30x30 SH-WFSs and with the choice to either use the 9x9 IR-WFSs or 2x2 VIS-WFSs for low order sensing. Thus, four modes will be available for the GRAVITY+ AO system (GPAO): IR-NGS, IR-LGS, VIS-NGS and VIS-LGS. To prepare the instrument commissioning and help the observers to plan their observations, a tool is needed to predict the performances of the different modes and for different observing conditions (NGS magnitude, science object magnitude, turbulence conditions...) We developed models based on a Mar{Ã©}chal approximation to predict the Strehl ratio of the four GPAO modes in order to feed the already existing tool that simulates the GRAVITY performances. Waiting for commissioning data, our model was validated and calibrated using the TIPTOP toolbox, a Point Spread Function simulator based on the computation of Power Spectrum Densities. In this work, we present our models of the NGS modes of GPAO and their calibration with TIPTOP.         |
