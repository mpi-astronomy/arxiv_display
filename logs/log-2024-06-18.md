|**Abstract**|            Context. Gas in protoplanetary disks mostly cools via thermal accommodation with dust particles. Thermal relaxation is thus highly sensitive to the local dust size distributions and the spatial distribution of the grains. So far, the interplay between thermal relaxation and gas turbulence has not been dynamically modeled in hydrodynamic simulations of protoplanetary disks with dust. Aims. We aim to study the effects of the vertical shear instability (VSI) on the thermal relaxation times, and vice versa. We are particularly interested in the influence of the initial dust grain size on the VSI and whether the emerging turbulence is sustained over long timescales. Results. We find that the emergence of the VSI is strongly dependent on the initial dust grain size. Coagulation also counteracts the emergence of hydrodynamic turbulence in our simulations, as shown by others before. Starting a simulation with larger grains (100 $\mu$m) generally leads to a less turbulent outcome. While the inner disk regions (within $\sim$ 70 au) develop turbulence in all three simulations, we find that the simulations with larger particles do not develop VSI in the outer disk. Conclusions. Our simulations with dynamically calculated thermal accommodation times based on the drifting and settling dust distribution show that the VSI, once developed in a disk, can be sustained over long timescales, even if grain growth is occurring. The VSI corrugates the dust layer and even diffuses the smaller grains into the upper atmosphere, where they can cool the gas. Whether the instability can emerge for a specific stratification depends on the initial dust grain sizes and the initial dust scale height. If the grains are initially $\gtrsim$ 100 $\mu$m and if the level of turbulence is initially assumed to be low, we find no VSI turbulence in the outer disk regions.         |

|| E. Wang, <mark>J. Lian</mark>, Y. Peng, X. Wang |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-06-18*|

|**Abstract**|            Both simulations and observations suggest that the disk assembly of galaxies is governed by the interplay between coplanar gas inflow, ex-planar gas outflow and in-situ star formation on the disk, known as the leaky accretion disk. This scenario predicts a strong connection between radial distributions of star formation and chemical abundances. The Milky Way, being the sole galaxy where we can reliably measure star formation histories and the corresponding temporally-resolved chemical abundances with individual stars, provides a unique opportunity to scrutinize this scenario. Based on the recent large spectroscopic and photometric surveys of Milky Way stars, we obtain the radial profiles of magnesium abundance ([Mg/H]) and star formation rate (SFR) surface density at different lookback time. We find the radial profiles of [Mg/H] can be well-reproduced using the leaky accretion disk model with only two free parameters for stars formed within 4 Gyr, as well as the flattening at large radii of metallicity profiles traced by HII regions and Cepheids. Furthermore, the constraint effective yield of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies show broad consistency with the theoretical predictions from stellar chemical evolution model with a mass-loading factor of 0-2. These results support that the recent assembly of the Milky Way adheres to the leaky accretion disk scenario, bridging the disk formation of our home galaxy to the big picture of disk formation in the Universe.         |

|**Abstract**|            The combination of the H I Ly{\alpha} (121.6 nm) line formation mechanism with ultraviolet (UV) Ly{\alpha} and white-light (WL) observations provides an effective method for determining the electron temperature of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). A key to ensuring the accuracy of this diagnostic technique is the precise calculation of theoretical Ly{\alpha} intensities. This study performs a modelled CME and its driven shock via the 3D MHD simulation. We generate synthetic UV and WL images of the CME and shock to quantify the impact of different assumptions on theoretical Ly{\alpha} intensities, such as the incident intensity of the Ly{\alpha} line (Idisk), the geometric scattering function (p({\theta})), and the kinetic temperature (Tn) assumed to be equal to the proton (Tp) or electron (Te) temperatures. By comparing differences of the Ly{\alpha} intensities under these assumptions, we find that: (1) Using the uniform or Carrington maps of the disk Ly{\alpha} emission underestimates the corona Ly{\alpha} intensity (< 10%) compared to the synchronic map, except for a slight overestimate (< 4%) in the partial CME core. The Carrington map yields lower uncertainties than the uniform disk. (2) The geometric scattering process has a minor impact on the Ly{\alpha} intensity, with a maximum relative uncertainty of < 5%. The Ly{\alpha} intensity is underestimated for the most part but overestimated in the CME core. (3) Compared to the assumption Tn = Tp, using Tn = Te leads to more complex relative uncertainties in CME Ly{\alpha} intensity. The CME core and void are both overestimated, with the maximum uncertainty in the core exceeding 50% and the void remaining below 35%. In the CME front, both over- and under-estimates exist with relative uncertainties of < 35%. The electron temperature assumption has a smaller impact on the shock, with an underestimated relative uncertainty of less than 20%.         |

|**Abstract**|            Sympathetic eruptions of solar prominences have been studied for decades, however, it is usually difficult to identify their causal links. Here we present two failed prominence eruptions on 26 October 2022 and explore their connections. Using stereoscopic observations, the south prominence (PRO-S) erupts with untwisting motions, flare ribbons occur underneath, and new connections are formed during the eruption. The north prominence (PRO-N) rises up along with PRO-S, and its upper part disappears due to catastrophic mass draining along an elongated structure after PRO-S failed eruption. We suggest that the eruption of PRO-S initiates due to a kink instability, further rises up, and fails to erupt due to reconnection with surrounding fields. The elongated structure connecting PRO-N overlies PRO-S, which causes the rising up of PRO-N along with PRO-S and mass drainage after PRO-S eruption. This study suggests that a prominence may end its life through mass drainage forced by an eruption underneath.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report the first arcsecond-resolution observations of the magnetic field in the mini starburst complex Sgr B2. SMA polarization observations revealed magnetic field morphology in three dense cores of Sgr B2 N(orth), M(ain), and S(outh). The total plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths in these cores are estimated to be 4.3-10.0 mG, 6.2-14.7 mG, and 1.9-4.5 mG derived from the angular dispersion function method after applying the correction factors of 0.21 and 0.5. Combining with analyses of the parsec-scale polarization data from SOFIA, we found that a magnetically supercritical condition is present from the cloud-scale ($\sim$10 pc) to core-scale ($\sim$0.2 pc) in Sgr B2, which is consistent with the burst of star formation activities in the region likely resulted from a multi-scale gravitational collapse from the cloud to dense cores.         |

|| C. Han, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-06-18*|
|*Comments*| *10 pages, 12 figures, 7 tables*|
|**Abstract**|            We investigated the nature of the anomalies appearing in four microlensing events KMT-2020-BLG-0757, KMT-2022-BLG-0732, KMT-2022-BLG-1787, and KMT-2022-BLG-1852. The light curves of these events commonly exhibit initial bumps followed by subsequent troughs that extend across a substantial portion of the light curves. We performed thorough modeling of the anomalies to elucidate their characteristics. Despite their prolonged durations, which differ from the usual brief anomalies observed in typical planetary events, our analysis revealed that each anomaly in these events originated from a planetary companion located within the Einstein ring of the primary star. It was found that the initial bump arouse when the source star crossed one of the planetary caustics, while the subsequent trough feature occurred as the source traversed the region of minor image perturbations lying between the pair of planetary caustics. The estimated masses of the host and planet, their mass ratios, and the distance to the discovered planetary systems are $(M_{\rm host}/M_\odot, M_{\rm planet}/M_{\rm J}, q/10^{-3}, \dl/{\rm kpc}) = (0.58^{+0.33}_{-0.30}, 10.71^{+6.17}_{-5.61}, 17.61\pm 2.25,6.67^{+0.93}_{-1.30})$ for KMT-2020-BLG-0757, $(0.53^{+0.31}_{-0.31}, 1.12^{+0.65}_{-0.65}, 2.01 \pm 0.07, 6.66^{+1.19}_{-1.84})$ for KMT-2022-BLG-0732, $(0.42^{+0.32}_{-0.23}, 6.64^{+4.98}_{-3.64}, 15.07\pm 0.86, 7.55^{+0.89}_{-1.30})$ for KMT-2022-BLG-1787, and $(0.32^{+0.34}_{-0.19}, 4.98^{+5.42}_{-2.94}, 8.74\pm 0.49, 6.27^{+0.90}_{-1.15})$ for KMT-2022-BLG-1852. These parameters indicate that all the planets are giants with masses exceeding the mass of Jupiter in our solar system and the hosts are low-mass stars with masses substantially less massive than the Sun.         |
