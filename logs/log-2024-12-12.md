|**Abstract**|            M dwarfs have become increasingly important in the detection of exoplanets and the study of Earth-sized planets and their habitability. However, 20-30% of M dwarfs have companions that can impact the formation and evolution of planetary systems. We use high-resolution imaging and Gaia astrometry to detect stellar companions around M dwarf exoplanet hosts discovered by TESS and determine the projected separation and estimated stellar masses for each system. We find 47 companions around 216 M dwarfs and a multiplicity rate of $19.4\pm2.7$% that is consistent with field M dwarfs. The binary projected separation distribution is shifted to larger separations, confirming the lack of close binaries hosting transiting exoplanets seen in previous studies. We correct the radii of planets with nearby companions and examine the properties of planets in M dwarf multi-star systems. We also note three multi-planet systems that occur in close binaries ($\lesssim 50$ au) where planet formation is expected to be suppressed.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the study of seven systems, three of which TOI-2295, TOI-2537, and TOI-5110 are newly discovered planetary systems. Through the analysis of TESS photometry, SOPHIE radial velocities, and high-spatial resolution imaging, we found that TOI-2295b, TOI-2537b, and TOI-5110b are transiting warm Jupiters with orbital periods ranging from 30 to 94 d, masses between 0.9 and 2.9 MJ, and radii ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 RJ. Both TOI-2295 and TOI-2537 each harbor at least one additional, outer planet. Their outer planets TOI-2295c and TOI-2537c are characterized by orbital periods of 966.5 +/- 4.3 and 1920^{+230}_{-140} d, respectively, and minimum masses of 5.61^{+0.23}_{-0.24} and 7.2 +/- 0.5 MJ, respectively. We also investigated and characterized the two recently reported warm Jupiters TOI-1836b and TOI-5076b, which we independently detected in SOPHIE RVs. Additionally, we study the planetary candidates TOI-4081.01 and TOI-4168.01. For TOI-4081.01, despite our detection in radial velocities, we cannot rule out perturbation by a blended eclipsing binary and thus exercise caution regarding its planetary nature. On the other hand, we identify TOI-4168.01 as a firm false positive. Finally, we highlight interesting characteristics of these new planetary systems. The transits of TOI-2295b are highly grazing, with an impact parameter of 1.056$^{+0.063}_{-0.043}$. TOI-2537b, in turn, is a temperate Jupiter with an effective temperature of 307+/-15 K and can serve as a valuable low-irradiation control for models of hot Jupiter inflation anomalies. We also detected significant transit timing variations (TTVs) for TOI-2537b, which are likely caused by gravitational interactions with the outer planet TOI-2537c. Finally, TOI-5110b stands out due to its orbital eccentricity of 0.75+/- 0.03, one of the highest planetary eccentricities discovered thus far.         |

|| X.-B. Sui, <mark>J. Liu</mark>, R.-G. Cai |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-12-12*|

|**Abstract**|            We investigate density fluctuations and scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) arising from the production of long-lived solitons and oscillons, which can dominate the early Universe and drive reheating prior to the standard radiation-dominated era. Curvature perturbations are generated not only by the Poisson distribution of these solitons/oscillons but are also amplified during the early matter-dominated phase when the solitons/oscillons dominate. Scalar-induced GWs with characteristic energy spectra emerge from these amplified curvature perturbations, particularly at the sudden transition from matter domination to radiation domination. We analyze this scenario and its GW predictions in detail, focusing on the impact of the initial energy fraction, the lifetime, and the average separation of these solitons/oscillons. This provides a wealth of potential observational targets for various GW detectors. Furthermore, for inflation and preheating models that produce oscillons with large separations, we derive new constraints on these models based on the upper bounds on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, as anticipated from future cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure observations.         |

|| R. Luo, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark>, <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-12-12*|

|**Abstract**|            Aims. We present observational results of H$_{2}$S 1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$, H$_{2}$$^{34}$S 1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$, H$_{2}$CS 5$_{14}$-4$_{14}$, HCS$^{+}$ 4-3, SiO 4-3, HC$_{3}$N 19-18 and C$^{18}$O 1-0 toward a sample of 51 late-stage massive star-forming regions, to study relationships among H$_{2}$S, H$_{2}$CS, HCS$^{+}$ and SiO in hot cores. Chemical connections of these S-bearing molecules are discussed based on the relations between relative abundances in sources. Results. H$_{2}$S 1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$, H$_{2}$$^{34}$S 1$_{10}$-1$_{01}$, H$_{2}$CS 5$_{14}$-4$_{14}$, HCS$^{+}$ 4-3 and HC$_{3}$N 19-18 were detected in 50 of the 51 sources, while SiO 4-3 was detected in 46 sources. C$^{18}$O 1-0 was detected in all sources. The Pearson correlation coefficients between H$_{2}$CS and HCS$^+$ normalized by H$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$S are 0.94 and 0.87, respectively, and a tight linear relationship is found between them with slope of 1.00 and 1.09, while they are 0.77 and 0.98 between H$_2$S and H$_2$CS, respectively, and 0.76 and 0.97 between H$_2$S and HCS$^+$. The values of full width at half maxima (FWHM) of them in each source are similar to each other, which indicate that they can trace similar regions. Comparing the observed abundance with model results, there is one possible time (2-3$\times$10$^{5}$ yr) for each source in the model. The abundances of these molecules increase with the increment of SiO abundance in these sources, which implies that shock chemistry may be important for them. Conclusions. Close abundance relation of H$_2$S, H$_2$CS and HCS$^+$ molecules and similar line widths in observational results indicate that these three molecules could be chemically linked, with HCS$^+$ and H$_2$CS the most correlated. The comparison of the observational results with chemical models shows that the abundances can be reproduced for almost all the sources at a specific time. The observational results, including abundances in these sources need to be considered in further modeling H$_{2}$S, H$_{2}$CS and HCS$^{+}$ in hot cores with shock chemistry.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present new orbital solutions for 15 binaries, which were astrometrically measured during 2010-2013. We observe the binary systems using the FastCam ``lucky-imaging'' camera, installed at the 1.5-m Carlos Sánchez Telescope (CST) at the Observatorio del Teide, Tenerife (Spain). We present first orbital solutions for four binaries and revise orbits for other 11 systems. We apply two orbital calculation techniques, the ``three-dimensional grid search method'' and the Docobo's analytical method. In addition, we use our tool ``Binary Deblending'', which is based on deblending the entire observed multiband photometry into fundamental and photometric parameters for each stellar component based on PARSEC isochrones. This method allows us to obtain the total mass for all systems. Our findings include the identification of a binary system consisting of two M-type dwarfs (WOR 19), a binary of evolved components (twin F6IV-V stars) in BU 1292, accompanied by a newly discovered wide (10.5 arcsec) and faint companion with G=17.05 mag. Additionally, we explore the X-ray emission system STF 147 and a very young quadruple system, WDS 04573+5345. This comprehensive analysis significantly contributes to our understanding on the formation and evolution of these stellar systems.         |
