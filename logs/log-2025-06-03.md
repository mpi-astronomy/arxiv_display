|**Abstract**|            Measuring a single elemental ratio (e.g., carbon-to-oxygen) provides insufficient information for understanding the formation mechanisms and evolution that affect our observations of gas giant planet atmospheres. Although the fields of planet formation, protoplanetary disks, and exoplanets are well established and interconnected, our understanding of how to self-consistently and accurately link the theoretical and observational aspects of these fields together is lacking. To foster interdisciplinary conversations, the Max-Planck Institut für Astronomie (MPIA) hosted a week-long workshop called, "Challenge Accepted: Linking Planet Formation with Present-Day Atmospheres." Here, we summarize the latest theories and results in planet formation modeling, protoplanetary disk observations, and atmospheric observations of gas giant atmospheres to address one of the challenges of hosting interdisciplinary conferences: ensuring everyone is aware of the state-of-the-art results and technical language from each discipline represented. Additionally, we highlight key discussions held at the workshop. Our main conclusion is that it is unclear what the ideal observable is to make this link between formation scenarios and exoplanet atmospheres, whether it be multiple elemental abundance ratios, measuring refractory budgets, or something else. Based on discussions held throughout the workshop, we provide several key takeaways of what the workshop attendees feel need the most improvement and exploration within each discipline.         |

|**Abstract**|            The prompt emission and afterglow phases of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been extensively studied, yet the transition between these two phases remains inadequately characterized due to limited multiwavelength observational coverage. Among the recent growing samples of fast X-ray transients observed by Einstein Probe (EP), a subgroup of gamma-ray bursts are captured with long-duration X-ray emission, potentially containing featured evolution from prompt emission to the afterglow phase. In this Letter, we present a detailed analysis of GRB 250404A/EP250404a, a bright fast X-ray transient detected simultaneously by EP and Fermi/GBM in X-rays and gamma-rays. Its continuous X-ray emission reveals a long-duration tail, accompanied by distinct spectral evolution manifested by the spectral index $\alpha_{\rm X}$ with an initial softening, followed by an evident hardening, eventually reaching a plateau at the value of $\sim$ -2. Early optical and near-infrared observations enable broadband modeling with forward- and reverse-shock components, confirming that the X-ray hardening signals the emergence of the external-shock afterglow. From this spectral hardening we infer that the prompt phase in soft X-rays lasted $\sim300$ s, which is more than three times longer than the gamma-ray $T_{90}$. This well-tracked soft-hard-flat spectral pattern provides a clear indication of afterglow emergence from the fading prompt emission and offers a practical criterion for identifying a distinct population of GRBs among fast X-ray transients, even when the detection of the gamma-ray counterpart or obvious temporal break is absent.         |

|**Abstract**|            Measuring plasma parameters in the upper solar corona and inner heliosphere is challenging because of the region's weakly emissive nature and inaccessibility for most in situ observations. Radio imaging of broadened and distorted background astronomical radio sources during solar conjunction can provide unique constraints for the coronal material along the line of sight. In this study, we present radio spectral imaging observations of the Crab Nebula (Tau A) from June 9 to June 22, 2024 when it was near the Sun with a projected heliocentric distance of 5 to 27 solar radii, using the Owens Valley Radio Observatory's Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) at multiple frequencies in the 30--80 MHz range. The imaging data reveal frequency-dependent broadening and distortion effects caused by anisotropic wave propagation through the turbulent solar corona at different distances. We analyze the brightness, size, and anisotropy of the broadened images. Our results provide detailed observations showing that the eccentricity of the unresolved source increases as the line of sight approaches the Sun, suggesting a higher anisotropic ratio of the plasma turbulence closer to the Sun. In addition, the major axis of the elongated source is consistently oriented in the direction perpendicular to the radial direction, suggesting that the turbulence-induced scattering effect is more pronounced in the direction transverse to the coronal magnetic field. Lastly, when the source undergoes large-scale refraction as the line of sight passes through a streamer, the apparent source exhibits substructures at lower frequencies. This study demonstrates that observations of celestial radio sources with lines of sight near the Sun provide a promising method for measuring turbulence parameters in the inner heliosphere.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Single-Mirror Small-Size Telescope (SST-1M) stereoscopic system is composed of two Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) designed for optimal performance for gamma-ray astronomy in the multi-TeV energy range. It features a 4-meter-diameter tessellated mirror dish and an innovative SiPM-based camera. Its optical system features a 4-m diameter spherical mirror dish based on the Davies-Cotton design, maintaining a good image quality over a large FoV while minimizing optical aberrations. In 2022, two SST-1M telescopes were installed at the Ondřejov Observatory, Czech Republic, at an altitude of 510 meters above sea level, and have been collecting data for commissioning and astronomical observations since then. We present the first SST-1M observations of the Crab Nebula, conducted between September 2023 and March 2024 in both mono and stereoscopic modes. During this observation period, 46 hours for the SST-1M-1 and 52 hours for the SST-1M-2 were collected for which 33 hours are in stereoscopic mode. We use the Crab Nebula observation to validate the expected performance of the instrument, as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations carefully tuned to account for instrumental and atmospheric effects. We determined that the energy threshold at the analysis level for the zenith angles below $30^\circ$ is 1 TeV for mono mode and 1.3 TeV for stereo mode. The energy and angular resolutions are approximately 20\% and $0.18^\circ$ for mono mode and 10\% and $0.10^\circ$ for stereo mode, respectively. We present the off-axis performance of the instrument and a detailed study of systematic uncertainties. The results of a full simulation of the telescope and its camera is compared to the data for the first time, allowing a deep understanding of the SST-1M array performance.         |

|**Abstract**|            Refractory elements such as iron, magnesium, and silicon can be detected in the atmospheres of ultrahot giant planets. This provides an opportunity to quantify the amount of refractory material accreted during formation, along with volatile gases and ices. However, simultaneous detections of refractories and volatiles have proved challenging, as the most prominent spectral features of associated atoms and molecules span a broad wavelength range. Here, using a single JWST observation of the ultrahot giant planet WASP-121b, we report detections of H$_2$O (5.5-13.5$\sigma$), CO (10.8-12.8$\sigma$), and SiO (5.7-6.2$\sigma$) in the planet's dayside atmosphere, and CH$_4$ (3.1-5.1$\sigma$) in the nightside atmosphere. We measure super-stellar values for the atmospheric C/H, O/H, Si/H, and C/O ratios, which point to the joint importance of pebbles and planetesimals in giant planet formation. The CH$_4$-rich nightside composition is also indicative of dynamical processes, such as strong vertical mixing, having a profound influence on the chemistry of ultrahot giant planets.         |
