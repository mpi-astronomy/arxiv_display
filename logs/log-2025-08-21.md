|**Abstract**|            Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal young massive clusters (YMCs) as key building blocks of early galaxies. They are not only important constituents of galaxies, but also potential birthplaces of very massive stars (VMSs) and black hole (BH) seeds. We explore stellar dynamics in extremely dense clusters with initial half-mass densities of $\rho_h \gtrsim 10^8M_\odot{\rm pc}^{-3}$ at very low metallicity, comparable to some of the densest clusters seen by JWST. Using direct N-body and Monte Carlo simulations with stellar evolution, we show that VMS formation through collisions is unavoidable, with final masses reaching $5\times10^3$ to $4\times10^4M_\odot$. These results support the existence of a critical mass scale above which collisions become highly efficient, enabling the formation of VMSs and intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs). Our models, using nbody6++gpu and MOCCA with updated SSE/BSE routines, show that dense clusters rapidly form VMSs via stellar bombardment. The VMSs then collapse into BH seeds of a few $10^3$ to $10^4M_\odot$ in less than 4 Myr. We identify a critical mass-density threshold beyond which clusters undergo runaway collisions that yield massive BH seeds. For typical YMCs detected by JWST, efficiencies up to 10% are expected, implying BH masses up to $10^5M_\odot$ if formed via collisions. We predict a scaling relation for BH mass, $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)=-0.76+0.76\log(M/M_\odot)$. Frequent VMS formation may also explain the high nitrogen abundance observed in galaxies at high redshift.         |

|**Abstract**|            Binary neutron stars (BNSs) are among the most interesting sources for multimessenger studies. A number of recently discovered BNSs in the Milky Way by radio telescopes have added new information to the parameter distribution of the Galactic BNSs. The scarce of BNS mergers during the O4 run of the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) suggests a BNS local merger rate six times lower than the previous constraint obtained by O1-O3 runs. With these new multimessenger observations, in this letter, we adopt the compact binary population synthesis model and Bayesian analysis to constrain the formation and evolution of BNSs, especially the common envelope (CE) evolution. We find that it is required: (1) a fraction ($f_{\rm HG}\sim0.8$) but not all of the Hertzsprung gap donors merged with their companions in the CE stage, in order to simultaneously explain the low BNS merger rate density and the existence of the short-orbital-period ($\lesssim 1$ day) Galactic BNSs, different from either all ($f_{\rm HG}=1$) or none ($f_{\rm HG}=0$) adopted in previous studies; (2) a large CE ejection efficiency $\alpha$ ($\sim 5$), in order to explain the existence of the long-orbital-period ($\gtrsim 10$ day) Galactic BNSs.         |

|**Abstract**|            Phase transitions in the early Universe give rise to effective masses for massless fields in the symmetry-broken phase. We use the lattice simulations to investigate the impact of a spectator scalar field with mass generation on the dynamics of first-order phase transitions and the generation of gravitational waves. In addition to the well-known friction effects, we identify a novel effect that significantly enhances the strength of first-order phase transitions. The amplitude of the mass-acquiring field is highly suppressed in the true vacuum bubbles, resulting in additional release of vacuum energy that concentrate on the bubble walls. We also establish an analytical method to explain our numerical results.         |
