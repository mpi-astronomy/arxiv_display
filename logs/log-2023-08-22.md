|**Abstract**| We explore the kinematic gas properties of six $5.5<z<7.4$ galaxies in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), using high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec multi-object spectroscopy of the rest-frame optical emission lines [OIII] and H$\alpha$. The objects are small and of low stellar mass ($\sim 1\,$kpc; $M_*\sim10^{7-9}\,{\rm M_\odot}$), less massive than any galaxy studied kinematically at $z>1$ thus far. The cold gas masses implied by the observed star formation rates are $\sim 10\times$ larger than the stellar masses. We find that their ionised gas is spatially resolved by JWST, with evidence for broadened lines and spatial velocity gradients. Using a simple thin-disc model, we fit these data with a novel forward modelling software that accounts for the complex geometry, point spread function, and pixellation of the NIRSpec instrument. We find the sample to include both rotation- and dispersion-dominated structures, as we detect velocity gradients of $v(r_{\rm e})\approx100-150\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, and find velocity dispersions of $\sigma_0\approx 30-70\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ that are comparable to those at cosmic noon. The dynamical masses implied by these models ($M_{\rm dyn}\sim10^{9-10}\,{\rm M_\odot}$) are larger than the stellar masses by up to a factor 40, and larger than the total baryonic mass (gas + stars) by a factor of $\sim 3$. Qualitatively, this result is robust even if the observed velocity gradients reflect ongoing mergers rather than rotating discs. Unless the observed emission line kinematics is dominated by outflows, this implies that the centres of these galaxies are dark-matter dominated or that star formation is $3\times$ less efficient, leading to higher inferred gas masses. |

|**Abstract**| We present ground and space-based photometric observations of TOI-270 (L231-32), a system of three transiting planets consisting of one super-Earth and two sub-Neptunes discovered by TESS around a bright (K-mag=8.25) M3V dwarf. The planets orbit near low-order mean-motion resonances (5:3 and 2:1), and are thus expected to exhibit large transit timing variations (TTVs). Following an extensive observing campaign using 8 different observatories between 2018 and 2020, we now report a clear detection of TTVs for planets c and d, with amplitudes of $\sim$10 minutes and a super-period of $\sim$3 years, as well as significantly refined estimates of the radii and mean orbital periods of all three planets. Dynamical modeling of the TTVs alone puts strong constraints on the mass ratio of planets c and d and on their eccentricities. When incorporating recently published constraints from radial velocity observations, we obtain masses of $M_{\mathrm{b}}=1.48\pm0.18\,M_\oplus$, $M_{c}=6.20\pm0.31\,M_\oplus$ and $M_{\mathrm{d}}=4.20\pm0.16\,M_\oplus$ for planets b, c and d, respectively. We also detect small, but significant eccentricities for all three planets : $e_\mathrm{b} =0.0167\pm0.0084$, $e_{c} =0.0044\pm0.0006$ and $e_{d} = 0.0066\pm0.0020$. Our findings imply an Earth-like rocky composition for the inner planet, and Earth-like cores with an additional He/H$_2$O atmosphere for the outer two. TOI-270 is now one of the best-constrained systems of small transiting planets, and it remains an excellent target for atmospheric characterization. |
