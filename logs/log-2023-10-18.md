|**Abstract**| We present the first results of the eXtreme UV Environments (XUE) James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) program, that focuses on the characterization of planet forming disks in massive star forming regions. These regions are likely representative of the environment in which most planetary systems formed. Understanding the impact of environment on planet formation is critical in order to gain insights into the diversity of the observed exoplanet populations. XUE targets 15 disks in three areas of NGC 6357, which hosts numerous massive OB stars, among which some of the most massive stars in our Galaxy. Thanks to JWST we can, for the first time, study the effect of external irradiation on the inner ($< 10$ au), terrestrial-planet forming regions of proto-planetary disks. In this study, we report on the detection of abundant water, CO, CO$_2$, HCN and C$_2$H$_2$ in the inner few au of XUE 1, a highly irradiated disk in NGC 6357. In addition, small, partially crystalline silicate dust is present at the disk surface. The derived column densities, the oxygen-dominated gas-phase chemistry, and the presence of silicate dust are surprisingly similar to those found in inner disks located in nearby, relatively isolated low-mass star-forming regions. Our findings imply that the inner regions of highly irradiated disks can retain similar physical and chemical conditions as disks in low-mass star-forming regions, thus broadening the range of environments with similar conditions for inner disk rocky planet formation to the most extreme star-forming regions in our Galaxy. |

|**Abstract**| Aqueous chemistry within carbonaceous planetesimals is promising for synthesizing prebiotic organic matter essential to all life. Meteorites derived from these planetesimals delivered these life building blocks to the early Earth, potentially facilitating the origins of life. Here, we studied the formation of vitamin B$_3$ as it is an important precursor of the coenzyme NAD(P)(H), which is essential for the metabolism of all life as we know it. We propose a new reaction mechanism based on known experiments in the literature that explains the synthesis of vitamin B$_3$. It combines the sugar precursors glyceraldehyde or dihydroxyacetone with the amino acids aspartic acid or asparagine in aqueous solution without oxygen or other oxidizing agents. We performed thermochemical equilibrium calculations to test the thermodynamic favorability. The predicted vitamin B$_3$ abundances resulting from this new pathway were compared with measured values in asteroids and meteorites. We conclude that competition for reactants and decomposition by hydrolysis are necessary to explain the prebiotic content of meteorites. In sum, our model fits well into the complex network of chemical pathways active in this environment. |

|**Abstract**| Void galaxies are essential to understand the physical processes that drive galaxy evolution as they are less affected by external factors than galaxies in denser environments, i.e. filaments, walls, and clusters. The stellar metallicity of a galaxy traces the accumulated fossil record of star formation through its entire life. Comparing the stellar metallicity of galaxies in various environments, including voids, filaments, walls, and clusters, can provide valuable insights into how the large-scale environment impacts galaxy chemical evolution. We present the first comparison of the total stellar mass vs. central stellar metallicity relation between galaxies in voids, filaments, walls, and clusters with different star formation history (SFH) types, morphologies, and colours, for stellar masses between 10^8.0 to 10^11.5 solar masses and redshift 0.01 < z < 0.05. We aim to better understand how the large-scale structure affects galaxy evolution by studying the stellar mass-metallicity relation of thousands of galaxies, which allows us to make a statistically sound comparison between galaxies in voids, filaments, walls, and clusters. We apply non-parametric full spectral fitting techniques (pPXF and STECKMAP) to 10807 spectra from the SDSS-DR7 (987 in voids, 6463 in filaments and walls, and 3357 in clusters) and derive their central mass-weighted average stellar metallicity. We find that galaxies in voids have on average slightly lower stellar metallicities than galaxies in filaments and walls (by 0.1 dex), and much lower than galaxies in clusters (by 0.4 dex). These differences are more significant for low-mass (10^9.25) than for high-mass galaxies, for long-timescale SFH (LT-SFH, extended along time) galaxies than for short-timescale SFHs (ST-SFH, concentrated at early times) galaxies, for spiral than for elliptical galaxies, and for blue than for red galaxies. |

|**Abstract**| Recently, the LHAASO collaboration reported the measurement of the gamma-ray spectra of GRB 221009A, which is the brightest burst ever, covering an energy range from 0.3 to about 10 TeV. Based on the observation by LHAASO, we examine the ALP-photon oscillation effect in the host galaxy of GRB 221009A and Milky Way. Considering the uncertain magnetic field configuration in the host galaxy, we set constraints on the ALP parameters with three different models: a homogeneous magnetic field model, a model same as the Galactic magnetic field model, and a model constructed from the HST observations of the host halo. The ${\rm CL_s}$ method is applied to set the constraints in this study. We find that the constraints derived with three host galaxy magnetic field models are comparable. Our results are complementary in the small ALP mass regions compared with other experiments. |
