|**Abstract**| Stars form in the dense interiors of molecular clouds. The dynamics and physical properties of the atomic interstellar medium (ISM) set the conditions under which molecular clouds and eventually stars will form. It is, therefore, critical to investigate the relationship between the atomic and molecular gas phase to understand the global star formation process. Using the high angular resolution data from The HI/OH/Recombination line survey of the Milky Way (THOR), we aim to constrain the kinematic and physical properties of the cold atomic hydrogen gas phase toward the inner Galactic plane. HI self-absorption (HISA) has proven to be a viable method to detect cold atomic hydrogen clouds in the Galactic plane. With the help of a newly developed self-absorption extraction routine (astroSABER), we build upon previous case studies to identify HI self-absorption toward a sample of Giant Molecular Filaments (GMFs). We find the cold atomic gas to be spatially correlated with the molecular gas on a global scale. The column densities of the cold atomic gas traced by HISA are usually of the order of $10^{20}\rm\,cm^{-2}$ whereas those of molecular hydrogen traced by $\rm^{13}CO$ are at least an order of magnitude higher. The HISA column densities are attributed to a cold gas component that accounts for a fraction of $\sim$5% of the total atomic gas budget within the clouds. The HISA column density distributions show pronounced log-normal shapes that are broader than those traced by HI emission. The cold atomic gas is found to be moderately supersonic with Mach numbers of a $\sim$few. In contrast, highly supersonic dynamics drive the molecular gas within most filaments. |

|**Abstract**| Short period exoplanets on circular orbits are thought to be tidally locked into synchronous rotation. If tidally locked, these planets must possess permanent day- and nightsides, with extreme irradiation on the dayside and none on the nightside. However, so far the tidal locking hypothesis for exoplanets is supported by little to no empirical evidence. Previous work showed that the super-Earth LHS 3844b likely has no atmosphere, which makes it ideal for constraining the planet's rotation. Here we revisit the Spitzer phase curve of LHS 3844b with a thermal model of an atmosphere-less planet and analyze the impact of non-synchronous rotation, eccentricity, tidal dissipation, and surface composition. Based on the lack of observed strong tidal heating we rule out rapid non-synchronous rotation (including a Mercury-like 3:2 spin-orbit resonance) and constrain the planet's eccentricity to less than 0.001 (more circular than Io's orbit). In addition, LHS 3844b's phase curve implies that the planet either still experiences weak tidal heating via a small-but-nonzero eccentricity (requiring an undetected orbital companion), or that its surface has been darkened by space weathering; of these two scenarios we consider space weathering more likely. Our results thus support the hypothesis that short period rocky exoplanets are tidally locked, and further show that space weathering can significantly modify the surfaces of atmosphere-less exoplanets. |

|**Abstract**| We present the continued analysis of polarization and Faraday rotation for the supernova remnants (SNRs) G46.8-0.3 and G39.2-0.3 in L-band (1-2 GHz) radio continuum in The HI/OH/Recombination line (THOR) survey. In this work, we present our investigation of Faraday depth fluctuations from angular scales comparable to the size of the SNRs down to scales less than our 16" beam (<~0.7 pc) from Faraday dispersion (sigma_phi). From THOR, we find median sigma_phi of 15.9 +/- 3.2 rad m^-2 for G46.8-0.3 and 17.6 +/- 1.6 rad m^-2 for G39.2-0.3. When comparing to polarization at 6cm, we find evidence for sigma_phi >~ 30 rad m^-2 in localized regions where we detect no polarization in THOR. We combine Faraday depth dispersion with the rotation measure (RM) structure function (SF) and find evidence for a break in the SF on scales less than the THOR beam. We estimate the RM SF of the foreground interstellar medium (ISM) using the SF of extra-Galactic radio sources (EGRS) and pulsars to find that the RM fluctuations we measure originate within the SNRs for all but the largest angular scales. |
