|**Abstract**| Ultra metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < -4.0) are very rare, and finding them is a challenging task. Both narrow-band photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy have been useful tools for identifying candidates, and in this work we combine both approaches. We cross-matched metallicity-sensitive photometry from the Pristine survey with the low-resolution spectroscopic LAMOST database, and re-analysed all LAMOST spectra with [Fe/H]_Pristine < -2.5. We find that ~1/3rd of this sample (selected without [Fe/H]_Pristine quality cuts) also have spectroscopic [Fe/H] < -2.5. From this sample, containing many low signal-to-noise (S/N) spectra, we selected eleven stars potentially having [Fe/H] < -4.0 or [Fe/H] < -3.0 with very high carbon abundances, and we performed higher S/N medium-resolution spectroscopic follow-up with OSIRIS on the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). We confirm their extremely low metallicities, with a mean of [Fe/H] = -3.4 and the most metal-poor star having [Fe/H]= -3.8. Three of these are clearly carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars with +1.65 < [C/Fe] < +2.45. The two most carbon-rich stars are either among the most metal-poor CEMP-s stars or the most carbon-rich CEMP-no stars known, the third is likely a CEMP-no star. We derived orbital properties for the OSIRIS sample and find that only one of our targets can be confidently associated with known substructures/accretion events, and that three out of four inner halo stars have prograde orbits. Large spectroscopic surveys may contain many hidden extremely and ultra metal-poor stars, and adding additional information from e.g. photometry as in this work can uncover them more efficiently and confidently. |

|**Abstract**| Using MIRI on-board JWST we present mid-infrared sub-arcsec imaging (MIRIM) and spectroscopy (MRS) of the hyperluminous infrared system SPT0311-58 at z=6.9. MIRI observations are compared with existing ALMA far-infrared continuum and [CII]158$\mu$m imaging. Even though the ALMA observations suggests very high star formation rates (SFR) in the eastern (E) and western (W) galaxies of the system, the H$\alpha$ line is not detected. This, together with the detection of the Pa$\alpha$ line, implies very high optical nebular extinction with lower limits of 4.2 (E) and 3.9 mag (W), and even larger 5.6 (E) and 10.0 (W) for SED derived values. The extinction-corrected Pa$\alpha$ SFRs are 383 and 230M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the E and W galaxies, respectively. This represents 50% of the SFRs derived from the [CII]158$\mu$m line and infrared light for the E galaxy and as low as 6% for the W galaxy. The specific SFR in the stellar clumps ranges from 25 to 59Gyr$^{-1}$, which are 3 to 10 times larger than the values measured in galaxies of similar mass at redshifts 6 to 8. The MIRI observations reveal a clumpy stellar structure, with each clump having 3 to 5 $\times$10$^{9}$M$_\mathrm{\odot}$, leading to a total stellar mass of 2.0 and 1.5$\times$10$^{10}$M$_\mathrm{\odot}$ for the E and W galaxies, respectively. The overall gas mass fraction is $M_\mathrm{gas}$/$M_*\sim3$, similar to that of z=4.5-6 star-forming galaxies. The observed properties of SPT0311-58 such as the clumpy distribution at sub(kpc) scales and the very high average extinction are similar to those observed in low- and intermediate-z LIRGs and ULIRGs, even though SPT0311-58 is observed only 800 Myr after the Big Bang. Massive, heavily obscured, clumpy starburst systems like SPT0311-58 likely represent the early phases in the formation of massive high-z bulge/spheroids and luminous quasars. |

|**Abstract**| We present the discovery of an Earth-mass planet ($M_b\sin i = 1.36\pm0.21M_\oplus$) on a 15.6d orbit of a relatively nearby ($d\sim$9.6pc) and low-mass ($0.167\pm0.011 M_\odot$) M5.0V star, Wolf 1069. Sitting at a separation of $0.0672\pm0.0014$au away from the host star puts Wolf 1069b in the habitable zone (HZ), receiving an incident flux of $S=0.652\pm0.029S_\oplus$. The planetary signal was detected using telluric-corrected radial-velocity (RV) data from the CARMENES spectrograph, amounting to a total of 262 spectroscopic observations covering almost four years. There are additional long-period signals in the RVs, one of which we attribute to the stellar rotation period. This is possible thanks to our photometric analysis including new, well-sampled monitoring campaigns undergone with the OSN and TJO facilities that supplement archival photometry (i.e., from MEarth and SuperWASP), and this yielded an updated rotational period range of $P_{rot}=150-170$d, with a likely value at $169.3^{+3.7}_{-3.6}$d. The stellar activity indicators provided by the CARMENES spectra likewise demonstrate evidence for the slow rotation period, though not as accurately due to possible factors such as signal aliasing or spot evolution. Our detectability limits indicate that additional planets more massive than one Earth mass with orbital periods of less than 10 days can be ruled out, suggesting that perhaps Wolf 1069 b had a violent formation history. This planet is also the 6th closest Earth-mass planet situated in the conservative HZ, after Proxima Centauri b, GJ 1061d, Teegarden's Star c, and GJ 1002 b and c. Despite not transiting, Wolf 1069b is nonetheless a very promising target for future three-dimensional climate models to investigate various habitability cases as well as for sub-ms$^{-1}$ RV campaigns to search for potential inner sub-Earth-mass planets in order to test planet formation theories. |

|**Abstract**| Atmospheric escape is a fundamental process that affects the structure, composition, and evolution of many planets. The signatures of escape are detectable on close-in, gaseous exoplanets orbiting bright stars, owing to the high levels of extreme-ultraviolet irradiation from their parent stars. The Colorado Ultraviolet Transit Experiment (CUTE) is a CubeSat mission designed to take advantage of the near-ultraviolet stellar brightness distribution to conduct a survey of the extended atmospheres of nearby close-in planets. The CUTE payload is a magnifying NUV (2479~--~3306 Ang) spectrograph fed by a rectangular Cassegrain telescope (206mm x 84mm); the spectrogram is recorded on a back-illuminated, UV-enhanced CCD. The science payload is integrated into a 6U Blue Canyon Technology XB1 bus. CUTE was launched into a polar, low-Earth orbit on 27 September 2021 and has been conducting this transit spectroscopy survey following an on-orbit commissioning period. This paper presents the mission motivation, development path, and demonstrates the potential for small satellites to conduct this type of science by presenting initial on-orbit science observations. The primary science mission is being conducted in 2022~--~2023, with a publicly available data archive coming on line in 2023. |

|**Abstract**| Line ratio diagnostics provide valuable clues on the source of ionizing radiation in galaxies with intense black hole accretion and starbursting events, like local Seyfert or galaxies at the peak of the star-formation history. We aim at providing a reference joint optical and mid-IR analysis for studying AGN identification via line ratios and test predictions from photoionization models. We obtained homogenous optical spectra with the Southern Africa Large Telescope for 42 Seyfert galaxies with IRS/Spitzer spectroscopy and X-ray to mid-IR multi-band data available. After confirming the power of main optical ([OIII]) and mid-IR ([NeV], [OIV], [NeIII]) emission lines tracing AGN activity, we explore diagrams based on ratios of optical and mid-IR lines by exploiting photoionization models of different ionizing sources (AGN, star formation and shocks). We find that pure AGN photoionization models reproduce well observations of Seyfert galaxies with an AGN fractional contribution to the mid-IR (5-40 micron) emission larger than 50 per cent. For targets with lower AGN contribution these same models do not fully reproduce the observed mid-IR line ratios. Mid-IR ratios like [NeV]/[NeII], [OIV]/[NeII] and [NeIII]/[NeII] show a dependence on the AGN fractional contribution to the mid-IR unlike optical line ratios. An additional source of ionization, either from star formation or radiative shocks, can help explain the observations in the mid-IR. Among combinations of optical and mid-IR diagnostics in line ratio diagrams, only those involving the [OI]/Halpha ratio are promising diagnostics to unravel simultaneously the relative role of AGN, star formation and shocks. A proper identification of the dominant ionizing source would require the exploitation of analysis tools based on advanced statistical techniques as well as spatially resolved data. |

|**Abstract**| This is the first of a series of papers that will introduce a user-friendly, detailed, and modular GALactic Chemical Evolution Model, GalCEM, that tracks isotope masses as a function of time in a given galaxy. The list of tracked isotopes automatically adapts to the complete set provided by the input yields. The present iteration of GalCEM tracks 86 elements broken down in 451 isotopes. The prescription includes massive stars, low-to-intermediate mass stars, and Type Ia supernovae as enrichment channels. We have developed a preprocessing tool that extracts multi-dimensional interpolation curves from the input yield tables. These interpolation curves improve the computation speeds of the full convolution integrals, which are computed for each isotope and for each enrichment channel. We map the integrand quantities onto consistent array grids in order to perform the numerical integration at each time step. The differential equation is solved with a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. We constrain our analysis to the evolution of all the light and intermediate elements from carbon to zinc, and lithium. Our results are consistent up to the extremely metal poor regime with Galactic abundances. We provide tools to track the mass rate change of individual isotopes on a typical spiral galaxy with a final baryonic mass of $5\times 10^{10} M_{\odot}$. Future iterations of the work will extend to the full periodic table by including the enrichment from neutron-capture channels as well as spatially-dependent treatments of galaxy properties.

|**Abstract**| Next-generation spectroscopic surveys such as the MegaMapper, MUltiplexed Survey Telescope (MUST), MaunaKea Spectroscopic Explorer (MSE), and Wide Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) are foreseen to increase the number of galaxy/quasar redshifts by an order of magnitude, with hundred millions of spectra that will be measured at $z>2$. We perform a Fisher matrix analysis for these surveys on the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO), the redshift-space distortion (RSD) measurement, the non-Gaussianity amplitude $f_{\rm NL}$, and the total neutrino mass $M_\nu$. For BAO and RSD parameters, these surveys may achieve precision at sub-percent level (<0.5 per cent), representing an improvement of factor 10 w.r.t. the latest database. For NG, these surveys may reach an accuracy of $\sigma(f_{\rm NL})\sim 1$. They can also put a tight constraint on $M_\nu$ with $\sigma(M_\nu) \sim 0.02\,\rm eV$ if we do joint analysis with Planck and even $ 0.01\,\rm eV$ if combined with other data. In addition, we introduce a general survey model, to derive the cosmic volume and number density of tracers, given instrumental facilities and survey strategy. Using our Fisher formalism, we can explore (continuously) a wide range of survey observational parameters, and propose different survey strategies that optimise the cosmological constraints. Fixing the fibre number and survey duration, we show that the best strategy for $f_{\rm NL}$ and $M_\nu$ measurement is to observe large volumes, despite the noise increase. However, the strategy differs for the apparent magnitude limit. Finally, we prove that increasing the fibre number improves $M_{\nu}$ measurement but not significantly $f_{\rm NL}$. |

|**Abstract**| Primordial black holes (PBHs) are predicted in many models via different formation mechanisms. Identifying the origin of PBHs is of the same importance as probing their existence. We propose to probe the asteroid-mass PBHs [$\mathcal{O}(10^{17})~{\rm g}\lesssim M\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{22})~{\rm g}$] with gamma-rays from Hawking radiation and the stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. We consider four concrete formation mechanisms, including collapse from primordial curvature perturbations, first-order phase transitions, or cosmic strings, and derive the extended PBH mass functions of each mechanism for phenomenological study. The results demonstrate that by combining gamma-rays and GW signals we can probe PBHs up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{19})~{\rm g}$ and identify their physical origins. |

|**Abstract**| Hyper-luminous optical/ultraviolet flares have been detected in Gamma-ray Bursts and the record was held by naked eye event GRB 080319B. Such flares are widely attributed to internal shock or external reverse shock radiation. With a new dedicated method developed to derive reliable photometry from saturated images of Swift/UVOT, here we carry out time-resolved analysis of the initial White band $150~{\rm s}$ exposure of GRB 220101A, a burst at the redshift of 4.618, and report a rapidly-evolving optical/ultraviolet flare with an unprecedented-high absolute AB magnitude $\sim-39.4$. At variance with GRB 080319B, the temporal behavior of this new flare does not trace the gamma-ray activities. Rather than either internal shocks or reverse shock, this optical/ultraviolet monster is most likely from the refreshed shocks induced by the catching-up of the late-ejected extremely-energetic material with the earlier-launched decelerating outflow. We detect the first ultraviolet/optical flare with an absolute AB magnitude brighter than $-39$ and reveal the efficient process to power such transients. |

|**Abstract**| We investigate for the first time the effect of the dark matter (DM) halos collisions, namely collisions of galaxies and galaxy clusters, through gravitational bremsstrahlung, on the stochastic gravitational wave background. We first calculate the gravitational wave signal of a single collision event, assuming point masses and linear perturbation theory. Then we proceed to the calculation of the energy spectrum of the collective effect of all dark matter collisions in the Universe. Concerning the DM halo collision rate we show that it is given by the product of the number density of DM halos, which is calculated by the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) theory, with the collision rate of a single DM halo, which is given by simulation results, with a function of the linear growth rate of matter density through cosmological evolution. Hence, integrating over all mass and distance ranges, we finally extract the spectrum of the stochastic gravitational wave background created by DM halos collisions. As we show, the resulting contribution to the stochastic gravitational wave background is of the order of $h_{c} \approx 10^{-30}$ in the pulsar timing array (PTA) band of $f \approx 10^{-9} Hz$, much smaller than other GW sources, such as super-massive black-hole mergers. However, in very low frequency band, it is larger. With current observational sensitivity it cannot be detected, nevertheless it may be accessible by PTA in the future, where techniques of distinguishing signal overlap should be used in order to isolate it and use it for cosmological studies. |

|| <mark>Yufeng Lin</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-01-09*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in A&A*|
|**Abstract**| Context. The Juno spacecraft has obtained highly accurate tidal Love numbers, which provide important constraints on the tidal response and interior structure of Jupiter. Aims. In order to exploit these observations, it is necessary to develop an approach for accurately calculating the tidal response of Jupiter for a given interior model and to investigate the role of interior structure. Methods. We directly solve the linearized tidal equations of a compressible, self-gravitating, rotating and viscous fluid body using a pseudo-spectral method. The Coriolis force is fully taken into account but the centrifugal effect is neglected. We can simultaneously obtain the real and imaginary parts of the tidal Love numbers for a given planetary interior model. Results. We calculate the tidal responses for three simple interior models of Jupiter which may contain a compact rigid core or an extended dilute core. All of models we consider can explain the fractional correction $\Delta k_{22}\approx -4\%$ due to dynamical tides, but all have difficulties to reconcile the observed $\Delta k_{42}\approx -11\%$ for the high-degree tidal Love number. We show that the Coriolis force significantly modifies gravity modes in an extended dilute core at the tidal frequency relevant to the Galilean satellites. We demonstrate that a thin stable layer in the outer region, if exists, would also influence the tidal responses of Jupiter. |

|**Abstract**| Multi-band photometric observations of eleven totally eclipsing contact binaries were carried out. Applying the Wilson-Devinney program, photometric solutions were obtained. There are two W-subtype systems, which are CRTS J133031.1+161202 and CRTS J154254.0+324652, and the rest systems are A-subtype systems. CRTS J154254.0+324652 has the highest fill-out factor with 94.3$\%$, and the lowest object is CRTS J155009.2+493639 with only 18.9$\%$. The mass ratios of the eleven systems are all less than 0.1, which means that they are extremely low mass ratio binary systems. We performed period variation investigation and found that the orbital periods of three systems decrease slowly, which may be caused by the angular momentum loss, and of six systems increase slowly, which indicates that the materials may transfer from the secondary component to the primary component. LAMOST low$-$resolution spectra of four objects were analyzed, and using the spectral subtraction technique, H$\alpha$ emission line was detected, which means that the four objects exhibit chromospheric activity. In order to understand their evolutionary status, the mass-luminosity and mass-radius diagrams were plotted. The two diagrams indicate that the primary component is in the main sequence evolution stage, and the secondary component is above TAMS, indicating that they are over-luminous. To determine whether the eleven systems are in stable state, the ratio of spin angular momentum to orbital angular momentum ($J_{s}/J_{o}$) and the instability parameters were calculated, and we argued that CRTS J234634.7+222824 is on the verge of a merger. |

|**Abstract**| Parameterised by the Love number $k_2$ and the tidal quality factor $Q$, and inferred from lunar laser ranging (LLR), tidal dissipation in the Moon follows an unexpected frequency dependence often interpreted as evidence for a highly dissipative, melt-bearing layer encompassing the core-mantle boundary. Within this, more or less standard interpretation, the basal layer's viscosity is required to be of order $10^{15}$ to $10^{16}$ Pa s, and its outer radius is predicted to extend to the zone of deep moonquakes. While the reconciliation of those predictions with the mechanical properties of rocks might be challenging, alternative lunar interior models without the basal layer are said to be unable to fit the frequency dependence of tidal $Q$. The purpose of our paper is to illustrate under what conditions the frequency-dependence of lunar tidal $Q$ can be interpreted without the need for deep-seated partial melt. Devising a simplified lunar model, in which the mantle is described by the Sundberg-Cooper rheology, we predict the relaxation strength and characteristic timescale of elastically-accommodated grain boundary sliding in the mantle that would give rise to the desired frequency dependence. Along with developing this alternative model, we test the traditional model with a basal partial melt; and we show that the two models cannot be distinguished from each other by the available selenodetic measurements. Additional insight into the nature of lunar tidal dissipation can be gained either by measurements of higher-degree Love numbers and quality factors or by farside lunar seismology. |

|**Abstract**| Small-scale impulsive events, known as nanoflares, are thought to be one of the prime candidates that can keep the solar corona hot at its multi-million Kelvin temperature. Individual nanoflares are difficult to detect with the current generation instruments; however, their presence can be inferred through indirect techniques such as a Differential Emission Measure (DEM) analysis. Here we employ this technique to investigate the possibility of nanoflare heating of the quiet corona during the minimum of solar cycle 24. During this minimum, active regions (ARs) were absent on the solar-disk for extended periods. In the absence of ARs, X-ray bright points (XBP) are the dominant contributor to disk-integrated X-rays. We estimate the DEM of the XBPs using observations from the Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM) onboard the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory. XBPs consist of small-scale loops associated with bipolar magnetic fields. We simulate such XBP loops using the EBTEL hydrodynamic code. The lengths and magnetic field strengths of these loops are obtained through a potential field extrapolation of the photospheric magnetogram. Each loop is assumed to be heated by random nanoflares having an energy that depends on the loop properties. The composite nanoflare energy distribution for all the loops has a power-law slope close to -2.5. The simulation output is then used to obtain the integrated DEM. It agrees remarkably well with the observed DEM at temperatures above 1 MK, suggesting that the nanoflare distribution, as predicted by our model, can explain the XBP heating. |

|**Abstract**| Cross-correlating the data of neutral hydrogen (HI) 21cm intensity mapping with galaxy surveys is an effective method to extract astrophysical and cosmological information. In this work, we investigate the cross-correlation of MeerKAT single-dish mode HI intensity mapping and China Space Station Telescope (CSST) spectroscopic galaxy surveys. We simulate a survey area of $\sim 300$ $\mathrm{deg}^2$ of MeerKAT and CSST surveys at $z=0.5$ using Multi-Dark N-body simulation. The PCA algorithm is applied to remove the foregrounds of HI intensity mapping, and signal compensation is considered to solve the signal loss problem in the HI-galaxy cross power spectrum caused by the foreground removal process. We find that from CSST galaxy auto and MeerKAT-CSST cross power spectra, the constraint accuracy of the parameter product $\Omega_{\rm HI}b_{\rm HI}r_{{\rm HI},g}$ can reach to $\sim1\%$, which is about one order of magnitude higher than the current results. After performing the full MeerKAT HI intensity mapping survey with 5000 deg$^2$ survey area, the accuracy can be enhanced to $<0.3\%$. This implies that the MeerKAT-CSST cross-correlation can be a powerful tool to probe the cosmic HI property and the evolution of galaxies and the Universe. |

|**Abstract**| The near-infrared (NIR) and X-ray emission of Sagittarius A* shows occasional bright flares that are assumed to originate from the innermost region of the accretion flow. We identified $25$ $4.5 \mu m$ and $24$ X-ray flares in archival data obtained with the \textit{Spitzer} and \textit{Chandra} observatories. With the help of general relativistic ray-tracing code, we modeled trajectories of ``hot spots'' and studied the light curves of the flares for signs of the effects of general relativity. Despite their apparent diversity in shape, all flares share a common, exponential impulse response, a characteristic shape that is the building block of the variability. This shape is symmetric, that is, the rise and fall times are the same. Furthermore, the impulse responses in the NIR and X-ray are identical within uncertainties, with an exponential time constant $\tau\sim 15$ minute. The observed characteristic flare shape is inconsistent with hot-spot orbits viewed edge-on. Individually modeling the light curves of the flares, we derived constraints on the inclination of the orbital plane of the hot spots with respect to the observer ($i \sim 30^{\circ} , < 75^{\circ} $) and on the characteristic timescale of the intrinsic variability (tens of minutes). |

|**Abstract**| We present 101 and 151 GHz ALMA continuum images for 85 fields selected from Herschel observations that have 500 micron flux densities >80 mJy and 250-500 micron colours consistent with z > 2, most of which are expected to be gravitationally lensed or hyperluminous infrared galaxies. Approximately half of the Herschel 500 micron sources were resolved into multiple ALMA sources, but 11 of the 15 brightest 500 micron Herschel sources correspond to individual ALMA sources. For the 37 fields containing either a single source with a spectroscopic redshift or two sources with the same spectroscopic redshift, we examined the colour temperatures and dust emissivity indices. The colour temperatures only vary weakly with redshift and are statistically consistent with no redshift-dependent temperature variations, which generally corresponds to results from other samples selected in far-infrared, submillimetre, or millimetre bands but not to results from samples selected in optical or near-infrared bands. The dust emissivity indices, with very few exceptions, are largely consistent with a value of 2. We also compared spectroscopic redshifts to photometric redshifts based on spectral energy distribution templates designed for infrared-bright high-redshift galaxies. While the templates systematically underestimate the redshifts by ~15%, the inclusion of ALMA data decreases the scatter in the predicted redshifts by a factor of ~2, illustrating the potential usefulness of these millimetre data for estimating photometric redshifts. |

|**Abstract**| Carbonate precipitation in oceans is essential for the carbonate-silicate cycle (inorganic carbon cycle) to maintain temperate climates. By considering the thermodynamics of carbonate chemistry, we demonstrate that the ocean pH decreases by approximately 0.5 for a factor of 10 increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide content. The upper and lower limits of ocean pH are within 1-4 of each other, where the upper limit is buffered by carbonate precipitation and defines the ocean pH when the carbon cycle operates. If the carbonate compensation depth (CCD) resides above the ocean floor, then carbonate precipitation and the carbon cycle cease to operate. The CCD is deep (>40 km) for high ocean temperature and high atmospheric carbon dioxide content. Key divalent carbonates of magnesium, calcium and iron produce an increasingly wider parameter space of deep CCDs, suggesting that chemical diversity promotes the carbon cycle. The search for life from exoplanets will benefit by including chemically more diverse targets than Earth twins. |

|**Abstract**| We present results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Director's Discretionary Time Early Release Science (ERS) program 1328 targeting the nearby, Luminous Infrared Galaxy (LIRG), VV 114. We use the MIRI and NIRSpec instruments to obtain integral-field spectroscopy of the heavily obscured Eastern nucleus (V114E) and surrounding regions. The spatially resolved, high-resolution, spectra reveal the physical conditions in the gas and dust over a projected area of 2-3 kpc that includes the two brightest IR sources, the NE and SW cores. Our observations show for the first time spectroscopic evidence that the SW core hosts an AGN as evidenced by its very low 6.2 {\mu}m and 3.3 {\mu}m PAH equivalent widths (0.12 and 0.017 {\mu}m respectively) and mid and near-IR colors. Our observations of the NE core show signs of deeply embedded star formation including absorption features due to aliphatic hydrocarbons, large quantities of amorphous silicates, as well as HCN due to cool gas along the line of sight. We detect elevated [Fe II]/Pf{\alpha} consistent with extended shocks coincident with enhanced emission from warm H$_{2}$, far from the IR-bright cores and clumps. We also identify broadening and multiple kinematic components in both H$_{2}$ and fine structure lines caused by outflows and previously identified tidal features. |

|**Abstract**| Forbidden emission lines in protoplanetary disks are a key diagnostic in studies of the evolution of the disk and the host star. We report spatially resolved emission lines, [OI] 6300, 6363, [NII] 6548, 6583, H$\alpha$, and [SII] 6716, 6730 Angstrom that are believed to be associated with jets and magnetically driven winds in the inner disks. Observations were carried out with the optical integral field spectrograph of the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). With a resolution of 0.025 X 0.025 arcsec$^{2}$, we aim to derive the position angle of the outflow/jet (PA$_{outflow/jet}$) that is connected with the inner disk. The forbidden emission lines analyzed here have their origin at the inner parts of the protoplanetary disk. From the maximum intensity emission along the outflow/jet in DL Tau, CI Tau, DS Tau, IP Tau, and IM Lup, we were able to reliably measure the PA$_{outflow/jet}$ for most of the identified lines. We found that our estimates agree with PA$_{dust}$ for most of the disks. These estimates depend on the signal-to-noise level and the collimation of the outflow (jet). The outflows/jets in CIDA 9, GO Tau, and GW Lup are too compact for a PA$_{outflow/jet}$ to be estimated. Based on our kinematics analysis, we confirm that DL Tau and CI Tau host a strong outflow/jet with line-of-sight velocities much greater than 100 km s$^{-1}$, whereas DS Tau, IP Tau, and IM Lup velocities are lower and their structures encompass low-velocity components to be more associated with winds. Our estimates for the mass-loss rate, $\dot{M}_{{loss}}$, range between (1.1-6.5)X10$^{-7}$-10$^{-8}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the disk-outflow/jet systems analyzed here. The outflow/jet systems analyzed here are aligned within around 1 degree between the inner and outer disk. Further observations are needed to confirm a potential misalignment in IM Lup. |
