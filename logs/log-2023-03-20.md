|**Abstract**| We present the first spatially resolved, X-ray spectroscopic study of the 4-8 keV diffuse emission found in the central part of the nearby starburst galaxy M82 on a few arcsecond scales. The new details that we see allow a number of important conclusions to be drawn on the nature of the hot gas and its origin as well as feedback on the ISM. We use archival data from Chandra with an exposure time of 570 ks. The Fexxv emission at 6.7 keV, expected from metal-enriched hot gas, is enhanced only in a limited area close to the starburst disc and is weak or almost absent over the rest of the diffuse emission, resulting in spatial variations in EW from <0.1 keV to 1.9 keV. This shows the presence of non-thermal emission due to inverse Compton scattering of the FIR photons by radio emitting cosmic ray electrons. The morphological resemblance between the diffuse X-ray, radio, and FIR emission maps supports this concept. Our decomposition of the diffuse emission spectrum indicates that ~70% of the 4-8 keV luminosity originates from the inverse Compton emission. The metal-rich hot gas with kT~5 keV makes a minor contribution to the 4-8 keV continuum, but it accounts for the majority of the observed Fexxv line. This hot gas appears to emerge from the circumnuclear starburst ring and fill the galactic chimneys identified as mid-infrared and radio emission voids. The energetics argument suggests that much of the supernova energy in the starburst site has gone into creating the chimneys and is transported to the halo. We argue that a hot, rarefied environment produced by strong supernova feedback results in displacing the brightest X-ray and radio supernova remnants which are instead found to reside in GMC. We find a faint X-ray source with a radio counterpart, close to the kinematic centre of the galaxy and we carefully examine the possibility that this source is a low-luminosity AGN in ADAF phase. |

|| De-Jiang Yin, et al. -- incl., <mark>Li-Yun Zhang</mark>, <mark>Bao-Da Li</mark>, <mark>Ming-Hui Li</mark> |

|**Abstract**| Up to November 2022, 267 pulsars have been discovered in 36 globular clusters (GCs). In this paper, we present our studies on the distribution of GC pulsar parameters and the detection efficiency. The power law relation between the average of dispersion measure ($\overline{\rm DM}$) and dispersion measure difference ($\Delta {\rm DM}$) of known pulsars in GCs is $\lg\Delta {\rm DM} \propto 1.52 \lg \overline{\rm DM}$. The sensitivity could be the key to find more pulsars. As a result, several years after the construction of a radio telescope, the GC pulsar number will be increased accordingly. We suggest that currently GCs in the southern hemisphere could have higher possibilities to find new pulsars. |

|| Tong Bao, <mark>Zhiyuan Li</mark>, Zhongqun Cheng |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-03-20*|

|**Abstract**| We present a systematic study of periodic X-ray sources in the massive globular cluster 47 Tuc, utilizing deep archival Chandra observations that resolve the cluster core and recently available eROSITA observations that cover the cluster outskirt. By applying the Gregory-Loredo algorithm, we detect 20 periodic signals among 18 X-ray sources, ranging between 205-95731 second. Fourteen periods are newly discovered in the X-ray band. We classify these periodic sources into four quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries, one milli-second pulsar, two coronally-active binaries and eleven cataclysmic variables (CVs), based on their X-ray temporal and spectral properties, as well as multi-band information. Despite a small sample subject to potential selection bias against faint and non-magnetic CVs, the 11 CVs together define an orbital period distribution significantly different from that of the CVs previously found in the solar neighborhood and the Galactic bulge. In particular, there exists in 47 Tuc an apparent paucity of short-period CVs below the period gap, which might be attributed to a high occupation fraction of non-magnetic CVs. Also characteristic of the 47 Tuc CVs are an overabundance of long-period CVs with a subgiant donor, a substantial fraction of CVs within the period gap, and a steep radial surface density profile. These are best understood as a group of CVs having recently formed via dynamical interactions in the dense cluster core. Despite sufficient sensitivity of the X-ray data, only one periodic source is found between one-third of the half-light radius and the tidal radius, the nature of which is unclear. |

|| <mark>Joseph DeRose</mark>, et al. -- incl., <mark>Zhongxu Zhai</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-03-20*|
|*Comments*| *35 pages, 14 figures, to be submitted to JCAP*|
|**Abstract**| We present the Aemulus $\nu$ simulations: a suite of 150 $(1.05 h^{-1}\rm Gpc)^3$ $N$-body simulations with a mass resolution of $3.51\times 10^{10} \frac{\Omega_{cb}}{0.3} ~ h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ in a $w\nu$CDM cosmological parameter space. The simulations have been explicitly designed to span a broad range in $\sigma_8$ to facilitate investigations of tension between large scale structure and cosmic microwave background cosmological probes. Neutrinos are treated as a second particle species to ensure accuracy to $0.5\, \rm eV$, the maximum neutrino mass that we have simulated. By employing Zel'dovich control variates, we increase the effective volume of our simulations by factors of $10-10^5$ depending on the statistic in question. As a first application of these simulations, we build new hybrid effective field theory and matter power spectrum surrogate models, demonstrating that they achieve $\le 1\%$ accuracy for $k\le 1\, h\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$ and $0\le z \le 3$, and $\le 2\%$ accuracy for $k\le 4\, h\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$ for the matter power spectrum. We publicly release the trained surrogate models, and estimates of the surrogate model errors in the hope that they will be broadly applicable to a range of cosmological analyses for many years to come. |

|| Haifeng Yang, et al. -- incl., <mark>Xujun Zhao</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-03-20*|

|**Abstract**| LAMOST (Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope) has completed the observation of nearly 20 million celestial objects, including a class of spectra labeled `Unknown'. Besides low signal-to-noise ratio, these spectra often show some anomalous features that do not work well with current templates. In this paper, a total of 638,000 `Unknown' spectra from LAMOST DR5 are selected, and an unsupervised-based analytical framework of `Unknown' spectra named SA-Frame (Spectra Analysis-Frame) is provided to explore their origins from different perspectives. The SA-Frame is composed of three parts: NAPC-Spec clustering, characterization and origin analysis. First, NAPC-Spec(Nonparametric density clustering algorithm for spectra) characterizes different features in the "unknown" spectrum by adjusting the influence space and divergence distance to minimize the effects of noise and high dimensionality, resulting in 13 types. Second, characteristic extraction and representation of clustering results are carried out based on spectral lines and continuum, where these 13 types are characterized as regular spectra with low S/Ns, splicing problems, suspected galactic emission signals, contamination from city light and un-gregarious type respectively. Third, a preliminary analysis of their origins is made from the characteristics of the observational targets, contamination from the sky, and the working status of the instruments. These results would be valuable for improving the overall data quality of large-scale spectral surveys. |

|| Zhihao Ouyang, et al. -- incl., <mark>Zelin Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-03-20*|
|*Comments*| *19 pages, 4 figures and 4 tables. Accepted to APJ*|
|**Abstract**| The `blazar sequence' has been proposed for more than 20 years, yet its nature is still unclear. In this work, for the first time, we expand this topic to the TeV band by using a sample of 58 TeV blazars including 48 blazars in the quiescent state and 21 blazars in the flaring state. We investigate the correlation between the TeV luminosity, which has been compensated for attenuation from extragalactic background light, and the synchrotron peak frequency. We note that there is no correlation between TeV luminosity and peak frequency in the quiescent state and a strong anti-correlation in the flaring state for the observed value. However, there is a strong positive correlation in both the quiescent state and the flaring state for the intrinsic value. This indicates that the blazar sequence is shown in the flaring state rather than in the quiescent state for the observed value and the blazar sequence is not present in both two states after removing the beaming effect. In addition, to confirm whether the beaming effect results in the blazar sequence, we compare the \textit{Fermi} $\gamma$-ray luminosity between the quiescent state and the flaring state. We find the \textit{Fermi} $\gamma$-ray luminosity in the flaring state is greater than that in the quiescent state and the Doppler factor in the flaring state is greater. We suggest the blazar sequence in the flaring state may be due to the stronger beaming effect. |

|| <mark>Julia Stadler</mark>, Fabian Schmidt, Martin Reinecke |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-03-20*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**| Cosmology inference of galaxy clustering at the field level with the EFT likelihood in principle allows for extracting all non-Gaussian information from quasi-linear scales, while robustly marginalizing over any astrophysical uncertainties. A pipeline in this spirit is implemented in the \texttt{LEFTfield} code, which we extend in this work to describe the clustering of galaxies in redshift space. Our main additions are: the computation of the velocity field in the LPT gravity model, the fully nonlinear displacement of the evolved, biased density field to redshift space, and a systematic expansion of velocity bias. We test the resulting analysis pipeline by applying it to synthetic data sets with a known ground truth at increasing complexity: mock data generated from the perturbative forward model itself, sub-sampled matter particles, and dark matter halos in N-body simulations. By fixing the initial-time density contrast to the ground truth, while varying the growth rate $f$, bias coefficients and noise amplitudes, we perform a stringent set of checks. These show that indeed a systematic higher-order expansion of the velocity bias is required to infer a growth rate consistent with the ground truth within errors. Applied to dark matter halos, our analysis yields unbiased constraints on $f$ at the level of a few percent for a variety of halo masses at redshifts $z=0,\,0.5,\,1$ and for a broad range of cutoff scales $0.08\,h/\mathrm{Mpc} \leq \Lambda \leq 0.20\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}$. Importantly, deviations between true and inferred growth rate exhibit the scaling with halo mass, redshift and cutoff that one expects based on the EFT of Large Scale Structure. Further, we obtain a robust detection of velocity bias through its effect on the redshift-space density field and are able to disentangle it from higher-derivative bias contributions. |

|**Abstract**| We present an overview of the CANDELS Lyman-a Emission At Reionization (CLEAR) survey. CLEAR is a 130 orbit program of the Hubble Space Telescope using the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) IR G102 grism. CLEAR targets 12 pointings divided between the GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields of the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS). Combined with existing spectroscopic data from other programs, the full CLEAR dataset includes spectroscopic imaging of these fields over 0.8-1.7 um. In this Paper, we describe the CLEAR survey, the survey strategy, the data acquisition, reduction, processing, and science products and catalogs released alongside this paper. The catalogs include emission line fluxes and redshifts derived from the combination of the photometry and grism spectroscopy for 6048 galaxies, primarily ranging from 0.2 < z < 3. We also provide an overview of CLEAR science goals and results. In conjunction with this Paper we provide links to electronic versions of the data products, including 1D + 2D extracted spectra and emission line maps. |
