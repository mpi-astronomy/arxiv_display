|**Abstract**|            The central engines of Little Red Dots (LRDs) may be ``black hole stars" (BH*s), early stages of black hole growth characterized by dense gas envelopes. So far, the most direct evidence for BH*s comes from a handful of sources where the host galaxy is completely outshone as suggested by their remarkably steep Balmer breaks. Here we present a novel scheme to disentangle BH*s from their host galaxies assuming that the [OIII]5008Å line arises exclusively from the host. Using a sample of 98 LRDs ($z$~$2-9$) with high quality NIRSpec/PRISM spectra, we demonstrate that the host-subtracted median stack displays a Balmer break $>2\times$ stronger than massive quiescent galaxies, with the rest-optical continuum resembling a blackbody-like SED ($T_{\rm{eff}}$~$4050$ K, $\log(L_{\rm{bol}})$~$43.9$ erg s$^{-1}$, $R_{\rm{eff}}$~$1300$ au). We measure a steep Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta>10$) and numerous density-sensitive features (e.g., FeII, HeI, OI). These are hallmark signatures of dense gas envelopes, providing population-level evidence that BH*s indeed power LRDs. In the median LRD, BH*s account for $\sim20\%$ of the UV emission, $\sim50\%$ at the Balmer break, and $\sim90\%$ at wavelengths longer than H$\alpha$ with the remainder arising from the host. BH*s preferentially reside in low-mass galaxies ($M_{\rm{\star}}$~$10^{8}\,{\rm M}_{\rm{\odot}}$) undergoing recent starbursts, as evidenced by extreme emission line EWs (e.g., [OIII]5008Å~$1100$Å, CIII]~$12$Å), thereby favoring BH* origins linked to star-formation. We show V-shaped LRD selections are biased to high BH*/host fractions ($\gtrsim60\%$ at 5500Å) -- less dominant BH*s may be powering JWST's blue broad-line AGN. We find BH*s are so commonplace and transient (duty cycle $\sim1\%$, lifetime $\sim10$ Myrs) that every massive black hole may have once shone as a BH*.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Euclid Early Release Observations (ERO) programme targeted the Perseus galaxy cluster in its central region over 0.7deg$^2$. We combined the exceptional image quality and depth of the ERO-Perseus with FUV and NUV observations from GALEX and AstroSat/UVIT, as well as $ugrizH\alpha$ data from MegaCam at the CFHT, to deliver FUV-to-NIR magnitudes of the 87 brightest galaxies within the Perseus cluster. We reconstructed the star-formation history (SFH) of 59 early-type galaxies (ETGs) within the sample, through the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code CIGALE and state-of-the-art stellar population (SP) models to reproduce the galactic UV emission from hot, old, low-mass stars (i.e. the UV upturn). In addition, for the six most massive ETGs in Perseus [stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}) \geq 10.3$], we analysed their spatially resolved SP through a radial SED fitting. In agreement with our previous work on Virgo ETGs, we found that (i) the majority of ETGs needs the presence of an UV upturn to explain their FUV emission, with temperatures $\langle T_{\rm UV}\rangle$~33800 K; (ii) ETGs have grown their stellar masses quickly, with SF timescales $\tau\lesssim 1500$ Myr. We found that all ETGs in the sample have formed more than about 30% of their stellar masses at z~5, up to ~100%. At z~5, the stellar masses of the most massive nearby ETGs, which have present-day stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})\gtrsim 10.8$, are then found to be comparable to those of the red quiescent galaxies observed by JWST at similar redshifts (z>4.6). This study can be extended to ETGs in the 14000 deg$^2$ extragalactic sky that will soon be observed by Euclid, in combination with those from other major upcoming surveys (e.g. Rubin/LSST), and UV observations, to ultimately assess whether the nearby massive ETGs represent the progeny of the massive high-z JWST red quiescent galaxies.         |

|| D. Deming, et al. -- incl., <mark>L. Kreidberg</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-01-30*|
|*Comments*| *14 pages, 6 figures, submission to The Open Journal of Astrophysics*|
|**Abstract**|            Detecting and characterizing the atmospheres of rocky exoplanets has proven to be challenging for JWST. Transit spectroscopy of the TRAPPIST-1 planets has been impacted by the effects of spots and faculae on the host star. Secondary eclipses have detected hot rocks, but evidence for atmospheres has been difficult to obtain. However, there is a third option that we call color phase curves. This method will apply to synchronously rotating non-transiting planets as well as transiting planets. A color phase curve uses photometry at a long-IR wavelength near the peak of the planetary thermal emission (e.g., 21 microns) divided by photometry at a shorter wavelength where the star dominates more strongly (e.g., 12 microns). We avoid wavelengths having potentially strong molecular absorption (e.g., 15 microns) to minimize degeneracies in the color phase curve, and we aim to detect and characterize the planetary atmosphere via its longitudinal heat transfer. The ratio of two wavelengths observed nearly simultaneously is designed to isolate thermal emission from the planet, discriminate against the star, and largely cancel instrumental systematic effects. Moreover, we show that invoking mass-radius relations, and using self-consistent physical models, will permit the longitudinal heat transfer to be measured independent of the orbital inclination. Radial velocity surveys are detecting many new exoplanets, including temperate rocky worlds with Earth-like masses. Most of those planets will not transit, but color phase curves have the potential to detect and characterize their atmospheres.         |

|| Q. Zou, et al. -- incl., <mark>T. Henning</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-01-30*|

|**Abstract**|            Observations of exoplanetary atmospheres provide critical insights into their chemical composition, formation and evolution history. Ultra-hot Jupiters serve as excellent targets for atmospheric characterization; studies of these planets may yield key understanding of gas giant's formation and evolution history. We present a thermal emission study of WASP-33 b's dayside atmosphere, based on two secondary eclipse observations with CFHT/WIRCam in two specific narrow band filters, namely the CO and CH4$_{\rm on}$ filters, and archival data with HST/WFC3 and Spitzer. Stellar pulsations of the host star induce some quasi-periodic photometric variations, particularly in the CH4$_{\rm on}$ band, which are modelled and corrected in the high-precision differential light curves. An eclipse depth of $1565.2^{+228.6}_{-237.5}$ ppm and $914.3^{+56.1}_{-57.0}$ ppm is determined for the CO and CH4$_{\rm on}$ bands, respectively. Combined with HST/WFC3 and Spitzer data, our joint retrieval of WASP-33 b's dayside atmosphere reveals a high metallicity ([Fe/H] $= 1.52^{+0.35}_{-0.52}$), high C/O ratio (C/O $= 0.78^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$), and a thermal inversion layer, suggesting a formation history involving metal-rich gas accretion. We confirm the presence of the molecules H$_{2}$O, H$^{-}$ and CO, and report a tentative detection of TiO in the dayside atmosphere of WASP-33 b. Future higher precision observations with JWST may provide better understand constraints on the chemical abundances of oxygen and refractory element abundances to better WASP-33 b's formation and evolutionary pathway.         |

|| E. Collaboration, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. Jahnke</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-01-30*|
|*Comments*| *21 pages, 11 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            The extragalactic background light (EBL) fluctuations in the optical/near-IR encode the cumulative integrated galaxy light (IGL), diffuse intra-halo light (IHL), and high-$z$ sources from the epoch of reionisation (EoR), but they are difficult to disentangle with auto-spectra alone. We aim to decompose the EBL into its principal constituents using multi-band intensity mapping combined with cosmic shear and galaxy clustering. We develop a joint halo-model framework in which IHL follows a mass- and redshift-dependent luminosity scaling, IGL is set by an evolving Schechter luminosity function, and EoR emission is modelled with Pop II/III stellar emissivities and a binned star-formation efficiency. Using mock surveys in a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with ten spectral bands spanning 0.75-5.0$\rm \mu m$ in the NEP deep fields over about 100$°^2$ with source detections down to AB=20.5 for masking, and six redshift bins to $z=2.5$, we fit auto- and cross-power spectra using a MCMC method. The combined SPHEREx$\times$Euclid analysis recovers all fiducial parameters within 1$\sigma$ and reduces 1$\sigma$ uncertainties on IHL parameters by 10-35% relative to SPHEREx EBL-only, while EoR star-formation efficiency parameters improve by 20-35%. Cross-correlations reveal a stronger coupling of IHL than IGL to the shear field, enhancing component separation; conversely, the EoR contribution shows negligible correlation with cosmic shear and galaxy clustering, aiding its isolation in the EBL. Relative to the SPHEREx EBL-only case, the inferred IHL fraction as a function of halo mass is significantly tightened over $10^{11}-10^{14} M_{\odot}$, with uncertainties reduced by 5-30%, and the resulting star-formation rate density constraints extend to $z\sim 11$, with uncertainty reductions of 22-31%.         |

|**Abstract**|            Extremely metal-poor stars are intrinsically rare, but emerging methods exist to accurately classify them from all-sky Gaia XP low-resolution spectra. To assess their overall accuracy for targeting metal-poor stars, we present a high-resolution spectroscopic followup of 75 very metal-poor candidates selected from the catalog by R. Andrae, V. Chandra, and H. W. Rix. We discover 2 new extremely metal-poor ($\rm{[Fe / H]}<-3$) stars and 20 new very metal-poor ($\rm{[Fe/H]} < -2$) stars. Abundances of up to 22 elements are derived from 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis and kinematic parameters are derived using Gaia astrometry and spectroscopic radial velocities. The chemodynamical properties are mostly consistent with expectations for halo stars, but we discover an Mg-enhanced CEMP star ($\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]} = 0.89$) and an Mg-poor star from an accreted ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. The Gaia XP metallicity estimates are consistent with our $\rm{[Fe/H]}$ measurements down to $\rm{[Fe/H]}\sim -3.0$, but estimates worsen in highly extincted regions. We find that 4 other XP-based metallicity catalogs succeed in mitigating contaminants and can also classify metal-poor stars robustly to $\rm{[Fe/H]}\sim -3.0$. Our results demonstrate the utility of Gaia XP spectra for identifying the most metal-poor stars across the Galaxy.         |

|| P. Nagarajan, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. El-Badry</mark>, <mark>J. Müller-Horn</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-01-30*|
|*Comments*| *6 pages, 1 figure*|
|**Abstract**|            BE Lyncis (BE Lyn) is a well-studied high-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti variable star (HADS). Recently, Niu et al. (2026) analyzed a 39-year baseline of times of maximum light of BE Lyn, reporting that it is the most eccentric binary known ($e \approx 0.9989$) and hosts the nearest black hole (BH) known to date. We analyze Hipparcos and Gaia astrometry of BE Lyn, predicting what the observed proper motion anomaly (PMA) over the 25 year baseline between the two missions would be were the companion really a $\gtrsim 17.5\,M_{\odot}$ BH. We find that the predicted PMA is at least an order of magnitude larger than the observed value of $\approx 1.7 \pm 0.8$ mas yr$^{-1}$, regardless of the assumed orientation of the orbit. We predict the expected Gaia DR3 RUWE for different orientations of the putative BH binary, finding that it ranges from $\approx 2.5$-$4.0$, much larger than the reported value of $1.073$. The observed value is instead consistent with a low-mass secondary or a single star. We find that BE Lyncis would have received a 7-parameter acceleration solution if it were a BH binary, in contradiction with its absence from the Gaia DR3 non-single star catalogs. Finally, we show that the reported orbit is impossible because the luminous star would overflow its Roche lobe at periastron, irrespective of inclination. We recommend caution in interpreting light-travel time effect (LTTE) models that require very high eccentricities, face-on inclinations, or large companion masses. The observed pulsation timing variations are most likely simply a result of red noise or pulsation phase evolution.         |

|*Comments*| *33 pages, 6 figures (including 73 panels), 6 tables*|
|**Abstract**|            We present a systematic pulse-by-pulse analysis of 22 long-duration GRBs observed by \emph{Swift}, each exhibiting a well-separated precursor before the main burst. We compare duration, spectral hardness ratio, minimum variability timescale (MVT), and spectral lag between these components. Both precursors and main bursts have durations and hardness broadly consistent with Type II GRBs. However, precursors show longer MVTs (by factors of 3-10) and diverse lags with near-zero median values, while main bursts display variable MVTs and positive lags. These differences suggest precursors may originate from distinct dissipation conditions, possibly due to cocoon shock breakout or early magnetically dominated outflows. Despite temporal differences, both episodes are consistent with a single collapsar origin, providing no evidence for dual-progenitor events. Our findings support pulse-resolved classification and show that precursors offer critical insights into jet formation and pre-burst activity.         |

|| <mark>J. Müller</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-01-30*|
|*Comments*| *accepted by A&A, 25 pages, 22 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            Recent observational studies of red giant stars have estimated the visibility of their mixed oscillation modes, which is a proxy of the average energy of these modes. Among other things, they demonstrated that although the damping rate of the oscillations in the core of many red giants appears to be negligible, other red giants exhibit high core damping rates that are sometimes consistent with the infinite value limit. Up until now, it has not been possible to link the mixed mode visibilities to core damping rates in a quantitative way. In this study, we use the progressive wave picture to derive an analytical function expressing the approximate resonance pattern of red giants up to a proportionality factor. This function can model the influence of the damping on the oscillations, as well as take into account other effects such as mode asymmetries. In particular, this expression can be used to obtain a quantitative estimate for the visibility of mixed modes and to predict the detectability of mixed mode and multiplet signatures under different core damping rates. Here, we conduct a parameter study to investigate how the damping processes affect these aspects. We find that the visibility approaches the value expected for an infinite core damping rate already at finite values. Furthermore, we find that both the mixed mode and the multiplet signatures disappear at finite core damping rates. This implies that the observational characteristics of red giants with finite core damping rates can appear as if their core damping rate were infinite, providing an explanation for the observed populations. Moreover, we have used our method to quantitatively estimate the core damping rates of red giants with unusually low mixed mode amplitudes from their observed visibilities.         |
