|**Abstract**|            Several evolved stars have been found to exhibit long-period radial velocity variations that cannot be explained by planetary or brown dwarf companions. Non-radial oscillations caused by oscillatory convective modes have been put forth as an alternative explanation, but no modeling attempt has yet been undertaken. We provide a model of a non-radial oscillation, aiming to explain the observed variations of the cluster giant NGC 4349 No. 127. The star was previously reported to host a brown dwarf companion, but whose existence was later refuted in the literature. We reanalyzed 58 archival HARPS spectra, acquiring additional activity indicators using the SERVAL and RACCOON pipelines. We searched for periodicity in the indicators and correlations between the indicators and radial velocities. We further present a simulation code able to produce synthetic HARPS spectra, incorporating the effect of non-radial oscillations, and compare the simulated results to the observed variations. We find a positive correlation between chromatic index and radial velocity, along with closed-loop Lissajous-like correlations between radial velocity and each of the spectral line shape indicators (full width at half maximum, and contrast of the cross-correlation function and differential line width). Simulations of a low-amplitude, retrograde, dipole (l = 1, m = 1), non-radial oscillation can reproduce the observed behavior and explain the observables. Photometric variations below the detection threshold of the available ASAS-3 photometry are predicted. The oscillation and stellar parameters are largely in agreement with the prediction of oscillatory convective modes. The periodic variations of the radial velocities and activity indicators, along with the respective phase shifts, measured for the intermediate-mass cluster giant NGC 4349 No. 127, can be explained by a non-radial oscillation.         |

|**Abstract**|            The gas-phase metallicity of galaxies is regulated by multiple astrophysical processes, which makes it a crucial diagnostic of galaxy formation and evolution. Beyond the fundamental mass-metallicity relation, a debate about the secondary galaxy property to predict the metallicity of galaxies arises. Motivated by this, we systematically examine the relationship between gas-phase metallicity and other galaxy properties, i.e. star formation rate (SFR) and galaxy size, in addition to stellar mass in both observation and simulation. We utilize the data from the MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory) survey and the TNG50 simulations. We find that the combination of $M_*/R_{\rm e}^\beta$ with $\beta\sim 0.6-1$ is in much stronger correlation to the metallicity than stellar mass alone, regardless of whether the SFR is included or not, in both observation and simulation. This indicates that galaxy size plays a more important role in determining gas-phase metallicity of galaxies than SFR. In addition, the TNG simulation predicts that the SFR, although being a subdominant role, becomes increasingly important in high-$z$ universe. Finally, we speculate that SFR modulates metallicity on the temporal dimension, synchronized with time-varying gas inflows, and galaxy size regulates metallicity on the spatial dimension by affecting the gravitational potential and the mass loading factor.         |
