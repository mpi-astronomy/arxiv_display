|**Abstract**|            The progenitors of Type II-P supernovae (SN) have been confirmed to be red supergiants. However, the upper mass limit of the directly probed progenitors is much lower than that predicted by current theories, and the accurate determination of the progenitor masses is key to understand the final fate of massive stars. Located at a distance of only 6.72 Mpc, the Type II-P SN 2024ggi is one of the closest SN in the last decade. Previous studies have analyzed its progenitor by direct detection, but the derived progenitor mass may be influenced by the very uncertain circumstellar extinction and pulsational brightness variability. In this work, we try to constrain the progenitor mass with an environmental analysis based on images from the Hubble Space Telescope. We found that stars in the progenitor environment have a uniform spatial distribution without significant clumpiness, and we derived the star formation history of the environment with a hierarchical Bayesian method. The progenitor is associated with the youngest population in the SN environment with an age of log($t$/yr) = 7.41 (i.e. 25.7 Myr), which corresponds to an initial mass of $10.2^{+0.06}_{-0.09}$ $M_\odot$. Our work provides an independent measurement of the progenitor mass, which is not affected by circumstellar extinction and pulsational brightness variability.         |

|**Abstract**|            With an aim towards modeling cosmologies beyond the LCDM paradigm, we demonstrate the automatic construction of recombination history emulators while enforcing a prior of causal dynamics. These methods are particularly useful in the current era of precision cosmology, where extremely constraining datasets provide insights into a cosmological model dominated by unknown contents. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data in particular provide a clean glimpse into the interaction of dark matter, baryons, and radiation in the early Universe, but interpretation of this data requires knowledge of the evolution of the ionization history of the Universe. The exploration of new physics with new CMB data will require fast and flexible calculation of this ionization history. We develop a differentiable machine learning model for recombination physics using a neural network ordinary differential equation model (Universal Differential Equations, UDEs), building towards automatic dimensionality reduction and the avoidance of manual tuning based on cosmological model.         |
