|**Abstract**| Ultra-cool dwarf stars are abundant, long-lived, and uniquely suited to enable the atmospheric study of transiting terrestrial companions with JWST. Amongst them, the most prominent is the M8.5V star TRAPPIST-1 and its seven planets, which have been the favored targets of eight JWST Cycle 1 programs. While Cycle 1 observations have started to yield preliminary insights into the planets, they have also revealed that their atmospheric exploration requires a better understanding of their host star. Here, we propose a roadmap to characterize the TRAPPIST-1 system -- and others like it -- in an efficient and robust manner. We notably recommend that -- although more challenging to schedule -- multi-transit windows be prioritized to constrain stellar heterogeneities and gather up to 2$\times$ more transits per JWST hour spent. We conclude that in such systems planets cannot be studied in isolation by small programs, thus large-scale community-supported programs should be supported to enable the efficient and robust exploration of terrestrial exoplanets in the JWST era. |

|**Abstract**| Storms operated by moist convection and the condensation of $\rm CH_{4}$ or $\rm H_{2}S$ have been observed on Uranus and Neptune. However, the mechanism of cloud formation, thermal structure, and mixing efficiency of ice giant weather layers remains unclear. In this paper, we show that moist convection is limited by heat transport on giant planets, especially on ice giants where planetary heat flux is weak. Latent heat associated with condensation and evaporation can efficiently bring heat across the weather layer through precipitations. This effect was usually neglected in previous studies without a complete hydrological cycle. We first derive analytical theories and show the upper limit of cloud density is determined by the planetary heat flux and microphysics of clouds but independent of the atmospheric composition. The eddy diffusivity of moisture depends on the heat fluxes, atmospheric composition, and gravity of the planet but is not directly related to cloud microphysics. We then conduct convection- and cloud-resolving simulations with SNAP to validate our analytical theory. The simulated cloud density and eddy diffusivity are smaller than the results acquired from the equilibrium cloud condensation model and mixing length theory by several orders of magnitude but consistent with our analytical solutions. Meanwhile, the mass-loading effect of $\rm CH_{4}$ and $\rm H_{2}S$ leads to superadiabatic and stable weather layers. Our simulations produced three cloud layers that are qualitatively similar to recent observations. This study has important implications for cloud formation and eddy mixing in giant planet atmospheres in general and observations for future space missions and ground-based telescopes. |

|**Abstract**| Gravitational wave (GW) standard siren observations provide a rather useful tool to explore the evolution of the universe. In this work, we wish to investigate whether the dark sirens with neutron star (NS) deformation from third-generation (3G) GW detectors could help probe the interaction between dark energy and dark matter. We simulate the GW dark sirens of four detection strategies based on the three-year observation and consider four phenomenological interacting dark energy models to perform cosmological analysis. We find that GW dark sirens could provide tight constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $H_0$ in the four IDE models, but perform not well in constraining the dimensionless coupling parameter $\beta$ with the interaction proportional to the energy density of cold dark matter. Nevertheless, the parameter degeneracy orientations of CMB and GW are almost orthogonal, and thus the combination of them could effectively break cosmological parameter degeneracies, with the constraint errors of $\beta$ being 0.00068-0.018. In addition, we choose three typical equation of states (EoSs) of NS, i.e., SLy, MPA1, and MS1, to investigate the effect of NS's EoS in cosmological analysis. The stiffer EoS could give tighter constraints than the softer EoS. Nonetheless, the combination of CMB and GW dark sirens (using different EoSs of NS) shows basically the same constraint results of cosmological parameters. We conclude that the dark sirens from 3G GW detectors would play a crucial role in helping probe the interaction between dark energy and dark matter, and the CMB+GW results are basically not affected by the EoS of NS. |

|**Abstract**| The study of distant galaxy groups and clusters at the peak epoch of star formation is limited by the lack of a statistically and homogeneously selected and spectroscopically confirmed sample. Recent discoveries of concentrated starburst activities in cluster cores have opened a new window to hunt for these structures based on their integrated IR luminosities. Hereby we carry out the large NOEMA (NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array) program targeting a statistical sample of infrared-luminous sources associated with overdensities of massive galaxies at z>2, the Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE). We present the first result from the ongoing NICE survey, a compact group at z=3.95 in the Lockman Hole field (LH-SBC3), confirmed via four massive (M_star>10^10.5M_sun) galaxies detected in CO(4-3) and [CI](1-0) lines. The four CO-detected members of LH-SBC3 are distributed over a 180 kpc physical scale, and the entire structure has an estimated halo mass of ~10^13Msun and total star formation rate (SFR) of ~4000Msun/yr. In addition, the most massive galaxy hosts a radio-loud AGN with L_1.4GHz, rest = 3.0*10^25W/Hz. The discovery of LH-SBC3 demonstrates the feasibility of our method to efficiently identify high-z compact groups or forming cluster cores. The existence of these starbursting cluster cores up to z~4 provides critical insights into the mass assembly history of the central massive galaxies in clusters. |

|**Abstract**| The Line Emission Mapper (LEM) is an X-ray Probe with with spectral resolution ~2 eV FWHM from 0.2 to 2.5 keV and effective area >2,500 cm$^2$ at 1 keV, covering a 33 arcmin diameter Field of View with 15 arcsec angular resolution, capable of performing efficient scanning observations of very large sky areas and enabling the first high spectral resolution survey of the full sky. The LEM-All-Sky Survey (LASS) is expected to follow the success of previous all sky surveys such as ROSAT and eROSITA, adding a third dimension provided by the high resolution microcalorimeter spectrometer, with each 15 arcsec pixel of the survey including a full 1-2 eV resolution energy spectrum that can be integrated over any area of the sky to provide statistical accuracy. Like its predecessors, LASS will provide both a long-lasting legacy and open the door to the unknown, enabling new discoveries and delivering the baseline for unique GO studies. No other current or planned mission has the combination of microcalorimeter energy resolution and large grasp to cover the whole sky while maintaining good angular resolution and imaging capabilities. LASS will be able to probe the physical conditions of the hot phases of the Milky Way at multiple scales, from emission in the Solar system due to Solar Wind Charge eXchange, to the interstellar and circumgalactic media, including the North Polar Spur and the Fermi/eROSITA bubbles. It will measure velocities of gas in the inner part of the Galaxy and extract the emissivity of the Local Hot Bubble. By maintaining the original angular resolution, LASS will also be able to study classes of point sources through stacking. For classes with ~$10^4$ objects, it will provide the equivalent of 1 Ms of high spectral resolution data. We describe the technical specifications of LASS and highlight the main scientific objectives that will be addressed. (Abridged) |
