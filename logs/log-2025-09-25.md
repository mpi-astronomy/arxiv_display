|**Abstract**|            The discovery of wide-orbit giant exoplanets has posed a challenge to our conventional understanding of planet formation by coagulation of dust grains and planetesimals, and subsequent accretion of protoplanetary disk gas. As an alternative mechanism, the direct in-situ formation of planets or planetary cores by gravitational instability (GI) in protoplanetary disks has been proposed. However, observational evidence for GI in regions where wide-orbit planets are formed is still lacking. Theoretical studies predict that GI induces spiral arms moving at the local Keplerian speed in a disk. Here, with multiple high angular resolution observations over a seven-year time baseline using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we report the evidence for spiral arms following the Keplerian rotation in the dust continuum disk around the young star IM Lup. This demonstrates that GI can operate in wide-orbit planet-formation regions, establishing it as a plausible formation mechanism for such planets.         |

|**Abstract**|            The multi-cycle JWST Treasury program NEXUS will obtain cadenced imaging and spectroscopic observations around the North Ecliptic Pole during 2024-2028. Here we report a systematic search for nuclear variability among $\sim 25\,$k sources covered by NIRCam (F200W+F444W) imaging using the first two NEXUS epochs separated by 9 months in the observed frame. Difference imaging techniques reach $1\sigma$ variability sensitivity of 0.18~mag (F200W) and 0.15~mag (F444W) at 28th magnitude (within 0".2 diameter aperture), improved to $0.01$~mag and $0.02$~mag at $<25$th magnitude, demonstrating the superb performance of NIRCam photometry. The difference imaging results represent significant improvement over aperture photometry on individual epochs (by $>30\%$). We identify 465 high-confidence variable sources among the parent sample, with 2-epoch flux difference at $>3\sigma$ from the fiducial variability sensitivity. Essentially all these variable sources are of extragalactic origin based on preliminary photometric classifications, and follow a similar photometric redshift distribution as the parent sample up to $z_{\rm phot}>10$. While the majority of these variability candidates are likely normal unobscured AGNs, some of them may be rare nuclear stellar transients and tidal disruption events that await confirmation with spectroscopy and continued photometric monitoring. We also constrain the photometric variability of ten spectroscopically confirmed broad-line Little Red Dots (LRDs) at $3\lesssim z \lesssim 7$, and find none of them show detectable variability in either band. We derive stringent $3\sigma$ upper limits on the F444W variability of $\sim 3-10\%$ for these LRDs, with a median value of $\sim 5\%$. These constraints imply weak variability in the rest-frame optical continuum of LRDs.         |

|**Abstract**|            Solar eruptions may occur at different evolutionary stages of active regions, during which the photospheric motions manifest in various forms, including flux emergence, sunspot rotation, shearing, converging, and magnetic flux diffusion. However, it remains unclear what are the specific roles played by these different motions in leading to eruptions. Here, we employ high resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations to demonstrate how solar eruptions can be initiated in a single bipolar configuration, driven by first shearing and then flux diffusion at the bottom surface. Flux diffusion disperses the photospheric magnetic flux, driving portions of it toward the polarity inversion line (PIL). This process leads to the expansion of core field, enhancing the pinching effect to form the current sheet. When magnetic reconnection occurs within this current sheet, the eruption is initiated, characterized by a rapid release of magnetic energy and accompanied by the formation of a erupting flux rope. Additionally, flux diffusion contributes to magnetic cancellation near the PIL, leading to the formation of a weakly twisted magnetic flux rope prior to the eruption. However, this pre-exist flux rope plays a limited role in eruption initiation, as its spatial position remains largely unchanged throughout the eruption. These findings demonstrate that the primary role of flux diffusion is to facilitate current sheet formation, highlighting the critical role of current sheet formation in eruption initiation.         |
