|**Abstract**|            We investigate the spatial extent of the [CII] line emission in a sample of 34 galaxies at $z=4-6$ from the ALMA-CRISTAL Survey. By modeling the [CII] line emission in the visibility data directly, we derive the effective radius of [CII] line emission assuming exponential distribution. These measurements comprise not only isolated galaxies but also interacting systems, identified thanks to the high spatial resolution of the data. The [CII] line radius ranges from 0.5 to 3.5 kpc with an average value of 1.9 kpc. We compare the [CII] sizes with the sizes of UV and FIR continua, which were measured from the HST F160W and ALMA Band-7 continuum images, respectively. We confirm that the [CII] line emission is more spatially extended than the continuum emission, with average size ratios of $R_{e,[CII]}/R_{e,UV}=2.90$ and $R_{e,[CII]}/R_{e,FIR}=1.54$, although about half of the FIR-detected sample show comparable spatial extent between [CII] line and FIR continuum emission ($R_{e,[CII]}\approx R_{e, FIR}$). The residual visibility data of the best-fit model do not show evidence of flux excesses either individually or in stacking analysis. This indicates that the [CII] line emission in star-forming galaxies can be characterized by an extended exponential disk profile. Overall, our results suggest that the spatial extent of [CII] line emission can primarily be explained by photodissociation regions associated with star formation activity, while the contribution from diffuse neutral medium (atomic gas) and the effects of mergers may further expand the [CII] line distributions, causing their variations among our sample. We report the correlations between the [CII] line, dust, and Lya line properties, which may be in line with our scenario. Future 3D-analysis of Lya and Ha lines will shed light on the association of the extended [CII] line emission with atomic gas and outflows.         |

|**Abstract**|            Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) play a pivotal role in influencing small-scale fluctuations within the primordial density field, thereby enhancing the matter power spectrum within the context of the $\Lambda$CDM model at small scales. These amplified fluctuations accelerate the early formation of galactic halos and stars, which can be observed through advanced high-redshift observational techniques. Therefore, Stellar Mass Density (SMD) observations, which provide significant opportunities for detailed studies of galaxies at small scales and high redshifts, offer a novel perspective on small-scale cosmic phenomena and constrain the characteristics of PMFs. In this study, we compile 14 SMD data points at redshifts $z > 6$ and derive stringent constraints on the parameters of PMFs, which include the amplitude of the magnetic field at a characteristic scale of $\lambda=1\,{\rm Mpc}$, denoted as $B_0$, and the spectral index of the magnetic field power spectrum, $n_{\rm B}$. At 95\% confidence level, we establish upper limits of $B_0 < 4.44$ nG and $n_{\rm B} < -2.24$, along with a star formation efficiency of approximately $f_*^0 \sim 0.1$. If we fix $n_{\rm B}$ at specific values, such as $-2.85$, $-2.9$, and $-2.95$, the 95\% upper limits for the amplitude of the magnetic field can be constrained to 1.33 nG, 2.21 nG, and 3.90 nG, respectively. Finally, we attempt to interpret recent early observations provided by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) using the theory of PMFs, and find that by selecting appropriate PMF parameters, it is possible to explain these results without significantly increasing the star formation efficiency.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the design and observations of low resolution JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy from the Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) Cycle 1 JWST Treasury program. Targets are selected using JWST/NIRCam photometry from UNCOVER and other programs, and cover a wide range of categories and redshifts to ensure the legacy value of the survey. These categories include the first galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$, faint galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization ($z\gtrsim6-8$), high redshift AGN ($z\gtrsim6$), Population III star candidates, distant quiescent and dusty galaxies ($1\lesssim z \lesssim 6$), and filler galaxies sampling redshift--color--magnitude space from $z\sim 0.1-13$. Seven NIRSpec MSA masks across the extended Abell 2744 cluster were observed, along with NIRCam parallel imaging in 8 filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, F444W, F480M) over a total area of ~26 arcmin$^2$, overlapping existing HST coverage from programs including the Hubble Frontier Fields and BUFFALO. We successfully observed 553 objects down to $m_{\mathrm{F444W}}\sim30\mathrm{AB}$, and by leveraging mask overlaps, we reach total on-target exposure times ranging from 2.4-16.7h. We demonstrate the success rate and distribution of confirmed redshifts, and also highlight the rich information revealed by these ultradeep spectra for a subset of our targets. An updated lens model of Abell 2744 is also presented, including 14 additional spectroscopic redshifts and finding a total cluster mass of $M_{\mathrm{SL}}=(2.1\pm0.3)\times10^{15}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We publicly release reduced 1D and 2D spectra for all objects observed in Summer 2023 along with a spectroscopic redshift catalog and the updated lens model of the cluster (this https URL).         |
