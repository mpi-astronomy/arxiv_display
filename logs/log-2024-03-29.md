|**Abstract**| The correlations between T, E modes and B modes in cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, which are expected to vanish under parity symmetry, have become a sensitive probe of the new physics beyond the standard model. In this paper, we forecast the estimation of TB and EB cross power spectra using NILC and cILC on AliCPT-1 simulations. We find that, NILC performs better than cILC on TB and EB correlations in light of its lower uncertainties. In terms of the birefringence angle estimation without assuming systematic errors, the combination of CMB TB and EB spectrum from NILC cleaned simulations could reach a sensitivity of $-0.049^\circ<\beta<0.056^\circ$ (95% CL). |
