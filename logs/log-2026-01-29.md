|**Abstract**|            Accurate modelling of redshift-space distortions (RSD) is essential for maximizing the cosmological information extracted from large galaxy redshift surveys. In preparation for the forthcoming analysis of the Euclid spectroscopic data, we investigate three approaches to modelling RSD effects on the power spectrum multipoles of mock H$\alpha$ emission line galaxies. We focus on two one-loop perturbation theory models -- the effective field theory (EFT) and velocity difference generator (${\rm VDG_ \infty}$) -- which differ in their treatment of the real-to-redshift space mapping on small scales, and a third approach, the BACCO emulator, which adopts a hybrid strategy combining perturbation theory with high-resolution N-body simulations. We assess the ability of these models to recover key cosmological parameters, including the expansion rate $h$, the cold dark matter density parameter $\omega_{\rm c}$, and the scalar amplitude $A_{\rm s}$, across four redshift bins spanning $0.9 \leq z \leq 1.8$. In each bin, we find that ${\rm VDG_ \infty}$ and BACCO outperform the EFT model across all scales up to $k_{max} \lesssim 0.35 h\,Mpc^{-1} $. While BACCO saturates in constraining power at intermediate scales and higher redshift, the ${\rm VDG_ \infty}$ model continues to improve parameter constraints beyond $k_{max} \gtrsim 0.30 h\,Mpc^{-1}$. The EFT model, although robust on large scales, exhibits significant parameter biases for $k_{max} \gtrsim 0.25 h\,Mpc^{-1}$, limiting its applicability to Euclid-like H$\alpha$ samples. Among the full perturbation theory-based models, the enhanced treatment of small-scale RSD effects in ${\rm VDG_ \infty}$ improves cosmological parameter constraints by up to a factor of two.         |

|**Abstract**|            JWST observations have revealed that massive galaxies formed and evolved far faster than predicted by galaxy formation models, with many having already assembled a large mass in stars $\sim12$ billion years ago [1-7]. However, masses of distant galaxies are highly uncertain, as they assume a distribution of stellar birth masses (the initial mass function [IMF]) similar to that in the Milky Way (MW). Specifically, the contribution from low-mass stars, which make up the bulk of stellar mass, is not directly observed, but inferred based on an extrapolation of the MW IMF. Here, we provide the first robust measurements of the IMF beyond the local Universe. Using ultra-deep spectra of nine massive, quiescent galaxies at $z\sim0.7$ from the ambitious JWST-IMFERNO program, extended to bluer wavelengths with deep spectra from LEGA-C [8], we find that these distant galaxies have excess low-mass stars. In other words, they have more bottom-heavy IMFs than the MW. For the oldest two galaxies, which are direct descendants of JWST's "impossibly early" galaxies, the bottom-heavy IMFs increase their stellar masses by a factor of $3-4$. These galaxies thus amplify the tension with galaxy formation models.         |

|**Abstract**|            Polarization observations using modern radio telescopes cover large numbers of frequency channels over broad bandwidths, and require advanced techniques to extract reliable scientific results. We present RM-Tools, analysis software for deriving polarization properties, such as Faraday rotation measures, from spectropolarimetric observations of linearly polarized radio sources. The software makes use of techniques such as rotation measure synthesis and QU-model fitting, along with many features to simplify and enhance the analysis of radio polarization data. RM-Tools is currently the main software that large-area polarization sky surveys such as POSSUM and VLASS deploy for science-ready data processing. The software code is freely available online and can be used with data from a wide range of telescopes.         |

|| R. Plume, et al. -- incl., <mark>S. Jiao</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-01-29*|

|**Abstract**|            We present observations of HCN and HCO$^+$ J = $3 - 2$ in the central $424'' \times 424''$ region of the W40 massive star forming region. The observations were taken as part of a pilot project for the MAJORS large program at the JCMT telescope. By incorporating prior knowledge of N(H$_2$) and $T_K$, assuming a constant density, and using the RADEX radiative transfer code we found that the HCN and HCO$^+$ abundances range from $X$(HCN) = $0.4-7.0 \times 10^{-8}$ and $X$(HCO$^+$) = $0.4-7.3 \times 10^{-9}$. Additional modelling using the NAUTILUS chemical evolution code, that takes H$_2$ density variations into account, however, suggests the HCN and HCO$^+$ abundances may be fairly constant. Careful modelling of three different positions finds $X$(HCN) = $1.3-1.7 \times 10^{-8}$, $X$(HCO$^+$) = $1.3-3.1 \times 10^{-9}$. Cross-comparison of the two models also provides a crude estimate of the gas density producing the HCN and HCO$^+$ emission, with H$_2$ densities in the range $5 \times 10^4 - 5 \times 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, suggesting that the HCN and HCO$^+$ emission does indeed arise from dense gas. High UV intensity (e.g. $G_o >$ a few thousand) has no effect on the abundances in regions where the visual extinction is large enough to effectively shield the gas from the UV field. In regions where $A_V < 6$, however, the abundance of both species is lowered due to destructive reactions with species that are directly affected by the radiation field.         |
