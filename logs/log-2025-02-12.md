|**Abstract**|            TOI-431 system has 3 close-in exoplanets, which gives an ideal lab to study gas escape. In this study, we measure the XUV luminosity for TOI-431 with XMM-Newton/EPIC-pn and OM data, then calculate the fluxes for the planets in the system. We find that, TOI-431 b's $\rm F_{XUV,b}=$$70286^{+12060}_{-2611}$$\rm \ erg\ cm^{-2}s^{-1}$ is 75 times of TOI-431 d $\rm F_{XUV,d}=$$935^{+160}_{-35}$$\rm \ erg\ cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. Adopting the energy limit method and hydrodynamic code $ATES$ with a set of He/H ratios, we obtain the mass-loss rates of $10^{10.51^{+0.07}_{-0.02}}$ g s$^{-1}$ for TOI-431 b, $10^{9.14^{+0.07}_{-0.02}}$ and $10^{9.84\sim 9.94}$ g s$^{-1}$ for TOI-431 d. We predict the $2.93\sim 7.91 \%$ H I Ly$\alpha$ and $0.19\sim 10.65\%$ He I triplet absorption depths for TOI-431 d, thus its gas escaping is detectable in principle. For both TOI-431 b and d, we select similar planets from the New Generation Planetary Population Synthesis (NGPPS) data. Then show that considering the mass-loss rates, TOI-431 b should be a naked solid planet, and TOI-431 d will likely maintain its gas envelope until the host star dies. According to the formation and evolution tracks, we find that TOI-431 b's potential birthplace (0.1-2 AU) should be inner than TOI-431 d (2-12 AU). Our results are consistent with the interpretation of the radius valley being caused by atmospheric escape. The intrinsic reason may be their birthplace, which will determine how close they can migrate to the host star, then lose mass and result in the Fulton gap.         |

|**Abstract**|            We re-analyze VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS K and H-band sparse aperture masking interferometry data of the transition disk HD 100546 observed in 2018 and 2021, respectively. We fit geometrical models to the closure phases extracted from both datasets. We compare three model classes: a forward scattering disk, a forward scattering disk plus an arbitrary asymmetric disk feature and a forward scattering disk plus an unresolved point source in the disk-gap. We find that the forward scattering disk plus point source model is the best representation of the data. We find that this point source candidate moved from a position of sep. = $39.9^{+2.8}_{-3.3}$ mas, P.A. = $124.1^{+1.0}_{-1.0}$ degrees to a sep. = $50.0^{+1.0}_{-1.0}$ mas, P.A. = $106.4^{+1.4}_{-1.4}$ degrees between 2018 and 2021. Both of these positions are well within the $\sim$13 au ($\sim$120 mas) disk-gap, favouring the point source interpretation. We explore the orbital parameter space that is consistent with the measured relative astrometry. We find orbits either with a similar orientation to the outer disk, with a high eccentricity $e \gtrapprox 0.65$, or orbits with a large relative inclination ($\sim$60 degrees) to the outer disk, and any eccentricity. Despite the significance of the observed point-source signal, follow-up observations will be necessary to conclusively determine its nature.         |
