|**Abstract**| Gravitational Wave High-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM), consisting of two micro-satellites, is designed to detect gamma-ray bursts associated with gravitational-wave events. Here, we introduce the real-time burst alert system of GECAM, with the adoption of the BeiDou-3 short message communication service. We present the post-trigger operations, the detailed ground-based analysis, and the performance of the system. In the first year of the in-flight operation, GECAM was triggered by 42 GRBs. GECAM real-time burst alert system has the ability to distribute the alert within $\sim$1 minute after being triggered, which enables timely follow-up observations. |

|**Abstract**| Filaments are elongated structures that connect groups and clusters of galaxies and are visually the striking feature in cosmological maps. In the literature, typically filaments are defined only using galaxies, assuming that these are good tracers of the dark matter distribution, despite the fact that galaxies are a biased indicator. Here we apply the topological filament extractor DisPerSE to the predictions of the semi-analytic code GAEA to investigate the correspondence between the properties of $z=0$ filaments extracted using the distribution of dark matter and the distribution of model galaxies evolving within the same large-scale structure. We focus on filaments around massive clusters with a mass comparable to Virgo and Coma, with the intent of investigating the influence of massive systems and their feeding filamentary structure on the physical properties of galaxies. We apply different methods to compare the properties of filaments based on the different tracers and study how the sample selection impacts the extraction. Overall, filaments extracted using different tracers agree, although they never coincide totally. We also find that the number of filaments ending up in the massive clusters identified using galaxies distribution is typically underestimated with respect to the corresponding dark matter filament extraction. |

|**Abstract**| As a part of the project aiming to build a homogeneous sample of binary-lens (2L1S) events containing brown-dwarf (BD) companions, we investigate the 2021 season microlensing data collected by the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) survey. For this purpose, we first identify 2L1S events by conducting systematic analyses of anomalous lensing events. We then select candidate BD-companion events by applying the criterion that the mass ratio between the lens components is less than $q_{\rm th}\sim 0.1$. From this procedure, we find four binary-lens events including KMT-2021-BLG-0588, KMT-2021-BLG-1110, KMT-2021-BLG-1643, and KMT-2021-BLG-1770, for which the estimated mass ratios are $q\sim 0.10$, 0.07, 0.08, and 0.15, respectively. The event KMT-2021-BLG-1770 is selected as a candidate despite the fact that the mass ratio is slightly greater than $q_{\rm th}$ because the lens mass expected from the measured short time scale of the event, $t_{\rm E}\sim 7.6$~days, is small. From the Bayesian analyses, we estimate that the primary and companion masses are $(M_1/M_\odot, M_2/M_\odot)= (0.54^{+0.31}_{-0.24}, 0.053^{+0.031}_{-0.023})$ for KMT-2021-BLG-0588L, $(0.74^{+0.27}_{-0.35}, 0.055^{+0.020}_{-0.026})$ for KMT-2021-BLG-1110L, $(0.73^{+0.24}_{-0.17}, 0.061^{+0.020}_{-0.014})$ for KMT-2021-BLG-1643L, and $(0.13^{+0.18}_{-0.07}, 0.020^{+0.028}_{-0.011})$ for KMT-2021-BLG-1770L. It is estimated that the probabilities of the lens companions being in the BD mass range are 82\%, 85\%, 91\%, and 59\% for the individual events. For confirming the BD nature of the lens companions found in this and previous works by directly imaging the lenses from future high-resolution adaptive-optics (AO) followup observations, we provide the lens-source separations expected in 2030, which is an approximate year of the first AO light on 30~m class telescopes. |
