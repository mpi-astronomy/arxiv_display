|| <mark>Y. Wang</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-11-03*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in A&A Letter*|
|**Abstract**|            V883 Ori is an FU-Orionis-type outburst system characterized by a shoulder at 50-70 au in its ALMA band 6 and 7 intensity profiles. Previously, this feature was attributed to dust pile-up from pebble disintegration at the water snowline. However, recent multi-wavelength observations show continuity in the spectral index across the expected snowline region, disfavoring abrupt changes in grain properties. Moreover, extended water emission is detected beyond 80 au, pointing to a snowline further out. This Letter aims to explain both features with a model in which the snowline is receding. We construct a 2D disk model that solves the cooling and subsequent vapor recondensation during the post-outburst dimming phase. Our results show that both the intensity shoulder and the extended water emission are natural relics of a retreating snowline: the shoulder arises from excess surface density generated by vapor recondensation at the moving condensation front, while the outer water vapor reservoir persists due to the long recondensation timescales of $10^{2}-10^{3}$ yr at the disk atmosphere. As V883 Ori continues to fade, we predict that the intensity shoulder will migrate inward by an observationally significant amount of 10 au over about 25 years.         |

|**Abstract**|            The large catalogues of galaxy clusters expected from the Euclid survey will enable cosmological analyses of cluster number counts that require accurate cosmological model predictions. One possibility is to use parametric fits calibrated against $N$-body simulations, that capture the cosmological parameter dependence of the halo mass function. Several studies have shown that this can be obtained through a calibration against haloes with spherical masses defined at the virial overdensity. In contrast, if different mass definitions are used for the HMF and the scaling relation, a mapping between them is required. Here, we investigate the impact of such a mapping on the cosmological parameter constraints inferred from galaxy cluster number counts. Using synthetic data from $N$-body simulations, we show that the standard approach, which relies on assuming a concentration-mass relation, can introduce significant systematic bias. In particular, depending on the mass definition and the relation assumed, this can lead to biased constraints at more than 2$\sigma$ level. In contrast, we find that in all the cases we have considered, the mass conversion based on the halo sparsity statistics result in a systematic bias smaller than the statistical error.         |

|**Abstract**|            3 Puppis is the brightest known B[e] star. Recent work classifies this A-type object as a supergiant, yet the impact of its binarity on the circumstellar environment (CE) remains hard to characterize. To resolve its dusty region at 5-10 mas, we obtained mid-IR interferometric observations with VLTI/MATISSE over 3-12 {\mu}m. Because the (u,v) coverage supports imaging, we introduce a statistical interferometric-imaging workflow based on MiRA to generate averaged images: this systematic approach enables the selection of an optimal set of reconstructions, improving the robustness and fidelity of the recovered features. We also use SPARCO, an independent tool well suited to bright central objects embedded in fainter extended emission. Images from both tools in the L, M, and N bands agree and reveal an asymmetric, elongated feature ~17 mas (~10 au at 631 pc) southeast of the star with ~20% density contrast. A second northwest asymmetry and a skewed inner rim are detected. Simple geometric modelling, guided by the MATISSE images, constrains the morphology, location, and flux of the CE and its asymmetries. The images are consistent with earlier VLTI measurements but expose a more complex CE with large-scale clumps in the southeast and northwest parts of the disc. Hydrodynamic modelling indicates that tidal spiral-wake perturbations from the central binary, dynamically excited at Lindblad resonances in the circumbinary disc, best explain the radial extent and curvature of the elongated structures seen in all bands.         |

|**Abstract**|            Photo-z algorithms that utilize SED template fitting have matured, and are widely adopted for use on high-redshift near-infrared data that provides a unique window into the early universe. Alternative photo-z methods have been developed, largely within the context of low-redshift optical surveys. Machine learning based approaches have gained footing in this regime, including those that utilize raw pixel information instead of aperture photometry. However, the efficacy of image-based algorithms on high-redshift, near-infrared data remains underexplored. Here, we test the performance of Detection, Instance Segmentation and Classification with Deep Learning (DeepDISC) on photometric redshift estimation with NIRCam images from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. DeepDISC is designed to produce probabilistic photometric redshift estimates directly from images, after detecting and deblending sources in a scene. Using NIRCam-only images and a compiled catalog of spectroscopic redshifts, we show that DeepDISC produces reliable photo-zs and uncertainties comparable to those estimated from template fitting using HST+JWST filters; DeepDISC even outperforms template fitting (lower scatter/fewer outliers) when the input photometric filters are matched. Compared with template fitting, DeepDISC does not require measured photometry from images, and can produce a catalog of 94000 photo-zs in ~4 minutes on a single NVIDIA A40 GPU. While current spectroscopic training samples are small and incomplete in color-magnitude space, this work demonstrates the potential of DeepDISC for increasingly larger image volumes and spectroscopic samples from ongoing and future programs. We discuss the impact of the training data on applications to broader samples and produce a catalog of photo-zs for all JADES DR2 photometric sources in the GOOD-S field, with quality flags indicating caveats.         |

|**Abstract**|            The cosmic microwave background power spectra are a primary window into the early universe. However, achieving interpretable, likelihood-compatible compression and fast inference under weak model assumptions remains challenging. We propose a parameter-conditioned variational autoencoder (CVAE) that aligns a data-driven latent representation with cosmological parameters while remaining compatible with standard likelihood analyses. The model achieves high-fidelity compression of the $D_\ell^{TT}$, $D_\ell^{EE}$, and $D_\ell^{TE}$ spectra into just 5 latent dimensions, with reconstruction accuracy exceeding $99.9\%$ within Planck uncertainties. It reliably reconstructs spectra for beyond-$\Lambda$CDM scenarios, even under parameter extrapolation, and enables rapid inference, reducing the computation time from $\sim$40 hours to $\sim$2 minutes while maintaining posterior consistency. The learned latent space demonstrates a physically meaningful structure, capturing a distributed representation that mirrors known cosmological parameters and their degeneracies. Moreover, it supports highly effective unsupervised discrimination among cosmological models, achieving performance competitive with supervised approaches. Overall, this physics-informed CVAE enables anomaly detection beyond $\Lambda$CDM and points to physically meaningful directions for refinement.         |
