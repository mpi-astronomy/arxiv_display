|**Abstract**|            The chemical abundance measurements of host stars and their substellar companions provide a powerful tool to trace the formation mechanism of the planetary systems. We present a detailed high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of a young M-type star, DH Tau A, which is located in the Taurus molecular cloud belonging to the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. This star is host to a low-mass companion, DH Tau b, and both star and the companion are still in their accreting phase. We apply our technique (Hejazi et al. 2024) to measure the abundances of carbon and oxygen using carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules, such as CO and OH, respectively. We determine a near-solar carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratio of C/O=0.555$\pm$0.063 for the host star DH Tau A. We compare this stellar abundance ratio with that of the companion from our previous study (C/O=0.54$^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$, Xuan et al. 2024), which also has a near-solar value. This confirms the chemical homogeneity in the DH Tau system, which suggests a formation scenario for the companion consistent with a direct and relatively fast gravitational collapse, rather than a slow core accretion process.         |

|**Abstract**|            A recent discovery shows that V404 Cygni, a prototypical black hole low-mass X-ray binary (BH-LMXB) is a hierarchical triple: the BH and donor star are orbited by a $1.2$ M$_{\odot}$ tertiary at a distance of at least $3500$ au. Motivated by this system, we evolve a grid of $\sim50,000$ triple star systems, spanning a broad range of initial orbits. Our calculations employ {\tt MESA} stellar evolution models, using {\tt POSYDON}, and self-consistently track the effects of eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) oscillations, mass loss, tides, and BH natal kicks. In our simulations, the progenitors of V404 Cygni-like systems have initial outer separations of $1000 - 10000$ au and inner separations of $\sim100$ au, such that they avoid Roche lobe overflow most of the time. Later on, EKL oscillations drive the inner binary to high eccentricities until tides shrink the orbit and mass transfer begins. Notably, such systems only form in simulations with very weak black hole natal kicks ($\lesssim 5\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) because stronger kicks unbind the tertiaries. Our simulations also predict a population of BH-LMXB triples that form via the classical common-envelope channel, when the BH progenitor does overflow its Roche lobe. The formation rate for this channel is also higher in triples than in isolated binaries because early EKL oscillations cause inner binaries with a wider range of initial separations to enter and survive a common envelope. Our calculations demonstrate that at least some stellar BHs form with extremely weak kicks, and that triple evolution is a significant formation channel for BH-LMXBs.         |

|| D. Li, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-26*|
|*Comments*| *36 pages, 12 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a newly discovered class of radio emitters with yet incomprehensibly long rotation periods, ranging from minutes to hours. The astrophysical nature of their isolated counterparts remains undetermined. We report a new LPT, DART J1832-0911 (2656.23 $\pm$ 0.15 s period), the first evidence associating such objects to supernova remnants (SNRs). Its dispersion measure distance aligns well with the distance of the SNR, confirming its origin from a supernova explosion. The source displays either phase-locked circularly polarized emission or nearly 100% linear polarization in radio bands. No detectable optical counterpart was found, even with a 10 m class telescope. The J1832-0911's SNR association, stable, highly polarized emission, and abnormally long period strongly favor its origin from a young neutron star, whose spin has been braked, possibly by interaction with supernova's fallback materials. This discovery provides critical insights into the nature of ultra-long period transients and their evolutionary link to stellar remnants.         |

|**Abstract**|            Magnetars are slowly rotating, highly magnetized young neutron stars that can show transient radio phenomena for radio pulses and fast radio bursts. We conducted radio observations of from two magnetars SGR J1935+2154 and 3XMM J185246.6+003317 and a high-magnetic field pulsar PSR J1846$-$0258 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). We performed single pulse and periodicity searches and did not detect radio signals from them. From the piggyback data recorded by other FAST telescope beams when we observed the magnetar SGR 1935+2154, we serendipitously discovered a new radio pulsar, PSR J1935+2200. We carried out the follow-up observations and obtained the timing solution based on these new observations and the archive FAST data. PSR J1935+2200 is an isolated old pulsar, with a spin period of $0.91$s, a spin-period derivative of $9.19 \times 10^{-15}$~s~s$^{-1}$, and a characteristic age of $1.57$ Myr. It is a weak pulsar with a flux density of 9.8 $\mu$Jy at 1.25 GHz. Discovery of a new pulsar from the long FAST observations of 30 minutes implies that there may be more weak older pulsars in the Galactic disk to be discovered.         |
