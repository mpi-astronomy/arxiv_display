|**Abstract**|            Direct observations of exoplanet and brown dwarf companions with near-infrared interferometry, first enabled by the dual-field mode of VLTI/GRAVITY, provide unique measurements of the objects' orbital motion and atmospheric composition. Here, we compile a homogeneous library of all exoplanet and brown dwarf K-band spectra observed by GRAVITY thus far. We re-reduce all available GRAVITY dual-field high-contrast data and, where companions are detected, extract their ~2.0-2.4 $\mu$m K-band contrast spectra. We then derive stellar model atmospheres for all employed flux references that we use to convert the companion contrast into companion flux spectra. Solely from the resulting GRAVITY spectra, we extract spectral types, spectral indices, and bulk physical properties for all companions. Finally, and with the help of age constraints from the literature, we also derive isochronal masses for most companions using evolutionary models. The resulting library contains R ~ 500 GRAVITY spectra of 39 substellar companions from late M to late T spectral type, including the entire L-T transition. Throughout this transition, a shift from CO-dominated late M- and L-type dwarfs to CH4-dominated T-type dwarfs can be observed in the K-band. The GRAVITY spectra alone constrain the objects' bolometric luminosity to typically within $\pm$0.15 dex. The derived isochronal masses agree with dynamical masses from the literature where available, except for HD 4113 c for which we confirm its previously reported potential underluminosity. Medium resolution spectroscopy of substellar companions with GRAVITY provides insight into the carbon chemistry and the cloudiness of these objects' atmospheres. It also constrains these objects' bolometric luminosity which can yield measurements of their formation entropy if combined with dynamical masses, for instance from Gaia and GRAVITY astrometry.         |

|**Abstract**|            Euclid is expected to establish new state-of-the-art constraints on extensions beyond the standard LCDM cosmological model by measuring the positions and shapes of billions of galaxies. Specifically, its goal is to shed light on the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Achieving this requires developing and validating advanced statistical tools and theoretical prediction software capable of testing extensions of the LCDM model. In this work, we describe how the Euclid likelihood pipeline, Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid (CLOE), has been extended to accommodate alternative cosmological models and to refine the theoretical modelling of Euclid primary probes. In particular, we detail modifications made to CLOE to incorporate the magnification bias term into the spectroscopic two-point correlation function of galaxy clustering. Additionally, we explain the adaptations made to CLOE's implementation of Euclid primary photometric probes to account for massive neutrinos and modified gravity extensions. Finally, we present the validation of these CLOE modifications through dedicated forecasts on synthetic Euclid-like data by sampling the full posterior distribution and comparing with the results of previous literature. In conclusion, we have identified in this work several functionalities with regards to beyond-LCDM modelling that could be further improved within CLOE, and outline potential research directions to enhance pipeline efficiency and flexibility through novel inference and machine learning techniques.         |

|**Abstract**|            Precise stellar ages are fundamental to Galactic archaeology. However, obtaining reliable age estimates and uncertainties for field stars has been a long-standing challenge. We test the fidelity of ages from recent catalogs of giants and subgiants using wide binaries, whose components formed at the same time and thus should have consistent inferred ages. We find that subgiant ages based on spectroscopic metallicities from Xiang & Rix (2022) are generally consistent within their reported uncertainties, implying that fractional uncertainties of 5-10% are realistically achievable. In contrast, we find that published photometric subgiant ages and red giant ages underestimate true uncertainties by factors of 2-5. These results demonstrate that accurate metallicity and $\alpha$-element abundances are essential for precise isochrone ages and establish wide binaries as a powerful, model-independent benchmark for calibrating stellar age measurements in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.         |

|**Abstract**|            A systematic study of 80 known pulsars observed at 185 MHz has been conducted using archival incoherent-sum data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The dataset comprises 48 drift-scan observations from the MWA Voltage Capture System, covering approximately 30,000 square degrees of sky with sensitivities reaching about 8 mJy in the deepest regions. An optimized PRESTO-based search pipeline was deployed on the China SKA Regional Centre infrastructure. This enabled the detection of 80 known pulsars, representing a 60 percent increase over the previous census. Notably, this includes 30 pulsars with first-time detections at this frequency, of which pulse profiles and flux densities are presented. Spectral, scattering, and pulse-width properties were examined for the sample, providing observational constraints on low-frequency turnover, propagation effects, and width-period relations. This study highlights the value of wide-field, low-frequency time-domain surveys for constraining pulsar emission and propagation, offering empirical insights that may inform future observations with instruments such as SKA-Low.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec 1.7--5.5 micron observations of SN~2024ggi at +285.51 and +385.27 days post-explosion. The late-time nebular spectra are dominated by emission lines from various ionization states of H, Ca, Ar, C, Mg, Ni, Co, and Fe. We also detect strong CO emission in both the first overtone and fundamental vibrational bands. Most atomic features exhibit asymmetric line profiles, indicating an aspherical explosion. Using observed fluxes combined with non-LTE radiative-transfer simulations, we develop a data-driven method that resolves the complex molecular-emission region, constrains its 3D structure, and reproduces high-fidelity spectral profiles. We find that, CO is mostly formed prior to +285d past explosion. The subsequent evolution is dominated by the evaporation of CO with CO mass varying from M(CO) of 8.7E-3 to 1.3E-3 Mo, and with instabilities growing from almost homogeneous to highly clumped (density contrast f_c of 1.2 to 2). The minimum velocity of CO only slightly decreases between epochs (v_1 of 1200 and 1100 km/sec), with the reference temperature dropping from T_1 of 2400 and 1900K.         |
