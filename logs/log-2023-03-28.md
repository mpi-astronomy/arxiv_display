|**Abstract**| The determination of the absolute and relative position of a spacecraft is critical for its operation, observations, data analysis, scientific studies, as well as deep space exploration in general. A spacecraft that can determine its own absolute position autonomously may perform more than that must rely on transmission solutions. In this work, we report an absolute navigation accuracy of $\sim$ 20 km using 16-day Crab pulsar data observed with $Fermi$ Gamma ray Burst Monitor (GBM). In addition, we propose a new method with the inverse process of the triangulation for joint navigation using repeated bursts like that from the magnetar SGR J1935+2154 observed by the Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) and GBM. |

|**Abstract**| This paper presents a study of the use of numerical simulation and Bayesian optimisation techniques to investigate the dynamics of celestial systems. Initially, the study focuses on Lagrange points in restricted three-body systems where a 2D three-body system simulator is employed to locate the five Lagrange points. An appropriate loss function is developed to capture the gravitational stability of the system, and the stability properties of the different Lagrange points are explored. Additionally, the study investigates how varying the number of variables for the satellite impacts the search for the Lagrange points. Finally, the scope of the study is expanded to explore stable configurations in multi-star systems represented by regular convex n-gons. In this case, Bayesian optimisation is used to find suitable settings for the n-gon's radius and the stars' velocity vectors, such that the overall system is stable. |

|**Abstract**| [abridged] We analyzed mid-infrared high-contrast coronagraphic images of the beta Pictoris system, taking advantage of the NEAR experiment using the VLT/VISIR instrument. The goal of our analysis is to investigate both the detection of the planet beta Pictoris b and of the disk features at mid-IR wavelengths. In addition, by combining several epochs of observation, we expect to constrain the position of the known clumps and improve our knowledge on the dynamics of the disk. To evaluate the planet b flux contribution, we extracted the photometry and compared it to the flux published in the literature. In addition, we used previous data from T-ReCS and VISIR, to study the evolution of the position of the southwest clump that was initially observed in the planetary disk back in 2003. While we did not detect the planet b, we were able to put constraints on the presence of circumplanetary material, ruling out the equivalent of a Saturn-like planetary ring around the planet. The disk presents several noticeable structures, including the known southwest clump. Using a 16-year baseline, sampled with five epochs of observations, we were able to examine the evolution of the clump: the clump orbits in a Keplerian motion with an sma of 56.1+-0.4 au. In addition to the known clump, the images clearly show the presence of a second clump on the northeast side of the disk and fainter and closer structures that are yet to be confirmed. We found correlations between the CO clumps detected with ALMA and the mid-IR images. If the circumplanetary material were located at the Roche radius, the maximum amount of dust determined from the flux upper limit around beta Pictoris b would correspond to the mass of an asteroid of 5 km in diameter. Finally, the Keplerian motion of the southwestern clump is possibly indicative of a yet-to-be-detected planet or signals the presence of a vortex. |
