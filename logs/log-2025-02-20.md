|**Abstract**|            We search for parameters defined from photometric images to quantify the ex situ stellar mass fraction of galaxies. We created mock images using galaxies in the cosmological hydrodynamical simulations TNG100, EAGLE, and TNG50 at redshift $z=0$. We define a series of parameters describing their structures. In particular, the inner and outer halo of a galaxy are defined by sectors ranging from $45-135$ degrees from the disk major axis, and with radii ranging from $3.5-10$ kpc and $10-30$ kpc, respectively, to avoid the contamination of disk and bulge. The surface brightness and colour gradients are defined by the same sectors along the minor axis and with similar radii ranges. We used the Random Forest method to create a model that predicts $f_{\rm exsitu}$ from morphological parameters. The model predicts $f_{\rm exsitu}$ well with a scatter smaller than 0.1 compared to the ground truth in all mass ranges. The models trained from TNG100 and EAGLE work similarly well and are cross-validated; they also work well in making predictions for TNG50 galaxies. The analysis using Random Forest reveals that $\nabla \rho_{\rm outer}$, $\nabla (g-r)_{\rm outer}$, $f_{\rm outerhalo}$ and $f_{\rm innerhalo}$ are the most influential parameters in predicting $f_{\rm exsitu}$, underscoring their significance in uncovering the merging history of galaxies. We further analyse how the quality of images will affect the results by using SDSS-like and HSC-like mock images for galaxies at different distances. Our results can be used to infer the ex situ stellar mass fractions for a large sample of galaxies from photometric surveys.         |

|**Abstract**|            T-type brown dwarfs present an opportunity to explore atmospheres teeming with molecules such as H2O, CH4 and NH3, which exhibit a wealth of absorption features in the mid-infrared. With JWST, we can finally explore this chemistry in detail, including for the coldest brown dwarfs that were not yet discovered in the Spitzer era. This allows precise derivations of the molecular abundances, which in turn informs our understanding of vertical transport in these atmospheres and can provide clues about the formation of cold brown dwarfs and exoplanets. This study presents the first JWST/MRS mid-IR spectrum (R ~ 1500-3000) of a T-dwarf: the T8.5+T9 brown dwarf binary WISE J045853.90+643451.9. We fit the spectrum using a parameterized P-T profile and free molecular abundances (i.e., a retrieval analysis), treating the binary as unresolved. We find a good fit with a cloud-free atmosphere and identify H2O, CH4 and NH3 features. Moreover, we make the first detections of HCN and C2H2 (at 13.4$\sigma$ and 9.5$\sigma$ respectively) in any brown dwarf atmosphere. The detection of HCN suggests intense vertical mixing ($K_{zz}\sim10^{11}$cm$^2$s$^{-1}$), challenging previous literature derivations of $K_{zz}$ values for T-type brown dwarfs. Even more surprising is the C2H2 detection, which cannot be explained with existing atmospheric models for isolated objects. This result challenges model assumptions about vertical mixing, and/or our understanding of the C2H2 chemical network, or might hint towards a more complex atmospheric processes such as magnetic fields driving aurorae, or lightning driving ionization. These findings open a new frontier in studying carbon chemistry within brown dwarf atmospheres.         |

|| <mark>H. Beuther</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-02-20*|
|*Comments*| *7 pages, 4 figures, accepted for Astronomy & Astrophysics*|
|**Abstract**|            Aims: We characterize and quantify this multi-scale flow for a prototypical high-mass star-forming region. Methods: In a multi-scale analysis from parsec to ~50au scales, we combined multiple single-dish and interferometric observations to study the gas flow from large-scale sizes of several parsec (Mopra) via intermediate-scale filamentary gas flows (ALMA-IMF) to the central cores (ALMA DIHCA and configuration 10 data). The highest-resolution multi-configuration ALMA dataset achieved a spatial resolution of 0.027''x0.022'' or 50au. Results: This multi-scale study allows us to follow the gas from the environment of the high-mass star-forming region (~2pc) via intermediate-scale (~0.25pc) filamentary gas flows down to the innermost cores within the central few 1000au. The intermediate-scale filaments connect spatially and kinematically to the larger-scale cloud as well as the innermost cores. We estimate a filamentary mass inflow rate around 10^-3M_sun/yr, feeding into the central region that hosts at least a dozen mm cores. While the flow from the cloud via the filaments down to 10^4au appears relatively ordered, within the central 10^4au the kinematic structures become much more complicated and disordered. We speculate that this is caused by the interplay of the converging infalling gas with feedback processes from the forming central protostars. Conclusions: This multi-scale study characterises and quantifies the hierarchical gas flow from clouds down to the central protostars for a prototypical infrared dark cloud with several embedded cores at an unprecedented detail. While comparatively ordered gas flows are found over a broad range of scales, the innermost area exhibits more disordered structures, likely caused by the combination of inflow, outflow and cluster dynamical processes.         |

|**Abstract**|            The spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry can lead to the formation of domain walls in the early Universe. In this work, we explore the impact of bias directions on the dynamics of $Z_N$ domain walls, mainly focusing on the $N = 3$ model with a biased potential. Utilizing the Press-Ryden-Spergel method, we numerically investigate the dynamics of domain walls with lattice simulations. We find notable differences in the dynamics of domain walls due to bias directions. Our results indicate that the annihilation time depends not only on the vacuum energy difference $\delta V$ but also on bias directions described by the relative potential difference $ \zeta $.         |
