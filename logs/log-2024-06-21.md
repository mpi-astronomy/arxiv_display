|**Abstract**|            Following the recommendations to NASA and ESA, the search for life on exoplanets will be a priority in the next decades. Two direct imaging space mission concepts are being developed: the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) and the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE). HWO focuses on reflected light spectra in the ultraviolet/visible/near-infrared (UV/VIS/NIR), while LIFE captures the mid-infrared (MIR) emission of temperate exoplanets. We assess the potential of HWO and LIFE in characterizing a cloud-free Earth twin orbiting a Sun-like star at 10 pc, both separately and synergistically, aiming to quantify the increase in information from joint atmospheric retrievals on a habitable planet. We perform Bayesian retrievals on simulated data from an HWO-like and a LIFE-like mission separately, then jointly, considering the baseline spectral resolutions currently assumed for these concepts and using two increasingly complex noise simulations. HWO would constrain H$_2$O, O$_2$, and O$_3$, in the atmosphere, with ~ 100 K uncertainty on the temperature profile. LIFE would constrain CO$_2$, H$_2$O, O$_3$ and provide constraints on the thermal atmospheric structure and surface temperature (~ 10 K uncertainty). Both missions would provide an upper limit on CH$_4$. Joint retrievals on HWO and LIFE data would accurately define the atmospheric thermal profile and planetary parameters, decisively constrain CO$_2$, H$_2$O, O$_2$, and O$_3$, and weakly constrain CO and CH$_4$. The detection significance is greater or equal to single-instrument retrievals. Both missions provide specific information to characterize a terrestrial habitable exoplanet, but the scientific yield is maximized with synergistic UV/VIS/NIR+MIR observations. Using HWO and LIFE together will provide stronger constraints on biosignatures and life indicators, potentially transforming the search for life in the universe.         |

|**Abstract**|            We investigate the correlation between stellar mass (M*) and star formation rate (SFR) across the stellar mass range log10(M*/Msun)~6-11. We consider almost 50,000 star-forming galaxies at z~3-7, leveraging data from COSMOS/SMUVS, JADES/GOODS-SOUTH, and MIDIS/XDF. This is the first study spanning such a wide stellar mass range without relying on gravitational lensing effects. We locate our galaxies on the SFR-M* plane to assess how the location of galaxies in the star-formation main sequence (MS) and starburst (SB) region evolves with stellar mass and redshift. We find that the two star-forming modes tend to converge at log10(M*/Msun) < 7, with all galaxies found in the SB mode. By dissecting our galaxy sample in stellar mass and redshift, we show that the emergence of the star-formation MS is stellar-mass dependent: while in galaxies with log10(M*/Msun) > 9 the MS is already well in place at z = 5-7, for galaxies with log10(M*/Msun)~7-8 it only becomes significant at z<4. Overall, our results are in line with previous findings that the SB mode dominates amongst low stellar-mass galaxies. The earlier emergence of the MS for massive galaxies is consistent with galaxy downsizing.         |

|| S. I. Sadavoy, et al. -- incl., <mark>T. Henning</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            We present ALMA Band 7 molecular line observations of the protostars within the VLA 1623 system. We map C$^{17}$O (3 - 2) in the circumbinary disk around VLA 1623A and the outflow cavity walls of the collimated outflow. We further detect red-shifted and blue-shifted velocity gradients in the circumstellar disks around VLA 1623B and VLA 1623W that are consistent with Keplerian rotation. We use the radiative transfer modeling code, pdspy, and simple flared disk models to measure stellar masses of $0.27 \pm 0.03$ M$_\odot$, $1.9^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ M$_\odot$, and $0.64 \pm 0.06$ M$_\odot$ for the VLA 1623A binary, VLA 1623B, and VLA 1623W, respectively. These results represent the strongest constraints on stellar mass for both VLA 1623B and VLA 1623W, and the first measurement of mass for all stellar components using the same tracer and methodology. We use these masses to discuss the relationship between the young stellar objects (YSOs) in the VLA 1623 system. We find that VLA 1623W is unlikely to be an ejected YSO, as has been previously proposed. While we cannot rule out that VLA 1623W is a unrelated YSO, we propose that it is a true companion star to the VLA 1623A/B system and that the these stars formed in situ through turbulent fragmentation and have had only some dynamical interactions since their inception.         |

|**Abstract**|            Very low-mass stars (those <0.3 solar masses) host orbiting terrestrial planets more frequently than other types of stars, but the compositions of those planets are largely unknown. We use mid-infrared spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope to investigate the chemical composition of the planet-forming disk around ISO-ChaI 147, a 0.11 solar-mass star. The inner disk has a carbon-rich chemistry: we identify emission from 13 carbon-bearing molecules including ethane and benzene. We derive large column densities of hydrocarbons indicating that we probe deep into the disk. The high carbon to oxygen ratio we infer indicates radial transport of material within the disk, which we predict would affect the bulk composition of any planets forming in the disk.         |
