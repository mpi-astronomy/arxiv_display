|**Abstract**|            The X-SHYNE library is a homogeneous sample of 43 medium-resolution (R=8000) infrared (0.3-2.5um) spectra of young (<500Myr), low-mass (<20Mjup), and cold (Teff=600-2000K) isolated brown dwarfs and wide-separation companions observed with the VLT/X-Shooter instrument. To characterize our targets, we performed a global comparative analysis. We first applied a semi-empirical approach. By refining their age and bolometric luminosity, we derived key atmospheric and physical properties, such as Teff, mass, surface gravity (g), and radius, using the evolutionary model COND03. These results were then compared with the results from a synthetic analysis based on three self-consistent atmospheric models. To compare our spectra with these grids we used the Bayesian inference code ForMoSA. We found similar Lbol estimates between both approaches, but an underestimated Teff from the cloudy models, likely due to a lack of absorbers that could dominate the J and H bands of early L. We also observed a discrepancy in the log(g) estimates, which are dispersed between 3.5 and 5.5 dex for mid-L objects. We interpreted this as a bias caused by a range of rotational velocities leading to cloud migration toward equatorial latitudes, combined with a variety of viewing angles that result in different observed atmospheric properties (cloud column densities, atmospheric pressures, etc.). Finally, while providing robust estimates of [M/H] and C/O for individual objects remains challenging, the X-SHYNE library globally suggests solar values, which are consistent with a formation via stellar formation mechanisms. This study highlights the strength of homogeneous datasets in performing comparative analyses, reducing the impact of systematics, and ensuring robust conclusions while avoiding over-interpretation.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present updated results from our near-infrared long-baseline interferometry (LBI) survey to constrain the multiplicity properties of intermediate-mass A-type stars within 80 pc. Previous adaptive optics surveys of A-type stars are incomplete at separations $<$ 20au. Therefore, a LBI survey allows us to explore separations previously unexplored. Our sample consists of 54 A-type primaries with estimated masses between 1.44-2.93 M$_{\odot}$ and ages 10-790 Myr, which we observed with the MIRC-X and MYSTIC instruments at the CHARA Array. We use the open source software CANDID to detect two new companions, seven in total, and we performed a Bayesian demographic analysis to characterize the companion population. We find the separation distribution consistent with being flat, and we estimate a power-law fit to the mass ratio distribution with index -0.13$^{+0.92}_{-0.95}$ and a companion frequency of 0.25$^{+0.17}_{-0.11}$ over mass ratios 0.1-1.0 and projected separations 0.01-27.54au. We find a posterior probability of 0.53 and 0.04 that our results are consistent with extrapolations based on previous models of the solar-type and B-type companion population, respectively. Our results suggest that the close companion population to A-type stars is comparable to that of solar-types and that close companions to B-type stars are potentially more frequent which may be indicative of increased disk fragmentation for stars $\gtrsim$ 3M$_{\odot}$.         |

|**Abstract**|            In the era of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, GW standard siren observations from binary neutron star mergers provide a powerful tool for probing the expansion history of the universe. Since sterile neutrinos can influence cosmic evolution by modifying the radiation content and suppressing structure formation, GW standard sirens offer promising prospects for constraining sterile neutrino properties within a cosmological framework. Building on this, we investigate the prospects for detecting sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy (DE) models using joint observations from 3G GW detectors and a future short gamma-ray burst detector, such as a THESEUS-like telescope. We consider three DE models: the $w$CDM, holographic DE (HDE), and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) models. Our results show that the properties of DE can influence the constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of GW data significantly improves constraints on both sterile neutrino parameters and other cosmological parameters across all three models, compared to the current limits derived from CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) observations. When GW data are included into the CBS dataset, a preference for $\Delta N_{\rm eff} > 0$ emerges at approximately the $1\sigma$ level in the $w$CDM and CPL models, and reaches about $3\sigma$ in the HDE model. Moreover, the upper limits on $m_{\nu,{\rm sterile}}^{\rm eff}$ are reduced by approximately 13%, 75%, and 3% in the $w$CDM, HDE, and CPL models, respectively.         |

|**Abstract**|            Double pulsar systems offer unrivaled advantages for the study of both astrophysics and fundamental physics. But only one has been visible: PSR J0737$-$3039; and its component pulsar B has now rotated out of sight due to the general-relativistic effect of geodetic precession. We know, though, that these precession cycles can also pivot pulsars into sight, and that this precession occurs at similar strength in PSR J1906+0746. That source is a young, unrecycled radio pulsar, orbiting a compact object with mass $\sim $1.32 M$_{\odot}$. This work presents a renewed campaign to detect radio pulsations from this companion, two decades after the previous search. Two key reasons driving this reattempt are the possibility that the companion radio beam has since precessed into our line of sight, and the improved sensitivity now offered by the FAST radio telescope. In 28 deep observations, we did not detect a credible companion pulsar signal. After comparing the possible scenarios, we conclude the companion is still most likely a pulsar that is not pointing at us. We next present estimates for the sky covered by such systems throughout their precession cycle. We find that for most system geometries, the all-time beaming fraction is unity, i.e., observers in any direction can see the system at some point. We conclude it is still likely that PSR J1906+0746 will be visible as a double pulsar in the future.         |

|**Abstract**|            A few ground-based solar coronagraphs have been installed in western China for observing the low-layer corona in recent years. However, determining the Helioprojective Coordinates for the coronagraphic data with high precision is an important but challenging step for further research with other multi-wavelength data. In this paper, we propose an automatic coronal image registration method that combines local statistical correlation and feature point matching to achieve accurate registration between ground-based coronal green-line images and space-based 211 Å images. Then, the accurate field of view information of the coronal green-line images can be derived, allowing the images to be mapped to the Helioprojective Cartesian Coordinates with an accuracy of no less than 0.1''. This method has been extensively validated using 100 days of coronal data spanning an 11-year period, demonstrating its broad applicability to ground-based coronagraphs equipped with green-line observations. It significantly enhances the scientific value of ground-based coronal data, enabling comprehensive studies of coronal transient activities and facilitating the joint analysis of data from multiple instruments. Additionally, it holds potential for future applications in improving the pointing accuracy of coronagraphs.         |
