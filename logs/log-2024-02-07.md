|**Abstract**| In anticipation of the Euclid Wide and Deep Surveys, we present optical emission-line predictions at intermediate redshifts from 0.4 to 2.5. Our approach combines a mock light cone from the GAEA semi-analytic model to self-consistently model nebular emission from HII regions, narrow-line regions of active galactic nuclei (AGN), and evolved stellar populations. Our analysis focuses on seven optical emission lines: H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [SII]$\lambda\lambda 6717, 6731$, [NII]$\lambda 6584$, [OI]$\lambda 6300$, [OIII]$\lambda 5007$, and [OII]$\lambda\lambda 3727, 3729$. We find that Euclid will predominantly observe massive, star-forming, and metal-rich line-emitters. Interstellar dust, modelled using a Calzetti law with mass-dependent scaling, may decrease observable percentages by a further 20-30% with respect to our underlying emission-line populations from GAEA. We predict Euclid to observe around 30-70% of H$\alpha$-, [NII]-, [SII]-, and [OIII]-emitting galaxies at redshift below 1 and under 10% at higher redshift. Observability of H$\beta$-, [OII]-, and [OI]- emission is limited to below 5%. For the Euclid-observable sample, we find that BPT diagrams can effectively distinguish between different galaxy types up to around redshift 1.8, attributed to the bias toward metal-rich systems. Moreover, we show that the relationships of H$\alpha$ and [OIII]+H$\beta$ to the star-formation rate, and the [OIII]-AGN luminosity relation, exhibit minimal changes with increasing redshift. Based on line ratios [NII]/H$\alpha$, [NII]/[OII], and [NII]/[SII], we further propose novel z-invariant tracers for the black hole accretion rate-to-star formation rate ratio. Lastly, we find that commonly used metallicity estimators display gradual shifts in normalisations with increasing redshift, while maintaining the overall shape of local calibrations. This is in tentative agreement with recent JWST data. |

|**Abstract**| The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) continues to dramatically increase the number of known transiting exoplanets, and is optimal for monitoring bright stars amenable to radial velocity (RV) and atmospheric follow-up observations. TOI-1386 is a solar-type (G5V) star that was detected via TESS photometry to exhibit transit signatures in three sectors with a period of 25.84 days. We conducted follow-up RV observations using Keck/HIRES as part of the TESS-Keck Survey (TKS), collecting 64 RV measurements of TOI-1386 with the HIRES spectrograph over 2.5 years. Our combined fit of the TOI-1386 photometry and RV data confirm the planetary nature of the detected TESS signal, and provide a mass and radius for planet b of $0.148\pm0.019$ $M_J$ and $0.540\pm0.017$ $R_J$, respectively, marking TOI-1386 b as a warm sub-Saturn planet. Our RV data further reveal an additional outer companion, TOI-1386 c, with an estimated orbital period of 227.6 days and a minimum mass of $0.309\pm0.038$ $M_J$. The dynamical modeling of the system shows that the measured system architecture is long-term stable, although there may be substantial eccentricity oscillations of the inner planet due to the dynamical influence of the outer planet. |

|**Abstract**| Aims. As part of the ongoing GRAVITY+ upgrade of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer infrastructure, we aim to improve the performance of the GRAVITY Fringe-Tracker, and to enable its use by other instruments. Methods. We modify the group delay controller to consistently maintain tracking in the white light fringe, characterised by a minimum group delay. Additionally, we introduce a novel approach in which fringe-tracking is performed in the non-observable Optical Path Length state-space, using a covariance-weighted Kalman filter and an auto-regressive model of the disturbance. We outline this new state-space representation, and the formalism we use to propagate the state-vector and generate the control signal. While our approach is presented specifically in the context of GRAVITY/GRAVITY+, it can easily be adapted to other instruments or interferometric facilities. Results. We successfully demonstrate phase delay tracking within a single fringe, with any spurious phase jumps detected and corrected in less than 100 ms. We also report a significant performance improvement, as evidenced by a reduction of about 30 to 40% in phase residuals, and a much better behaviour under sub-optimal atmospheric conditions. Compared to what was observed in 2019, the median residuals have decreased from 150 nm to 100 nm on the Auxiliary Telescopes and from 250 nm to 150 nm on the Unit Telescopes. Conclusions. The improved phase-delay tracking combined with whit light fringe tracking means that from now-on, the GRAVITY Fringe-Tracker can be used by other instruments operating in different wavebands. The only limitation remains the need for an optical path dispersion adjustment. |

|**Abstract**| We present a comprehensive investigation on the mass function (MF) of a snake-like stellar structure in the solar neighbourhood, building on our previous discovery. To ensure the reliability of the data, we reselect the member stars of the Stellar ``Snake'' in the latest {\it Gaia} Data Release 3 using the same approach as the initial series of articles. We also precisely measure the physical parameters of the clusters within the Stellar Snake. In light of the high completeness of the member stars in the cluster regions, we develop a simulated model color-magnitude diagram-based inference method to derive the mass function, binary fraction, and mass-ratio distribution of the clusters in the Stellar Snake. Notably, despite their similar ages and metallicity, we discover systematic variations in the MFs along the elongation direction of the Snake in the mass range of 0.5 to 2.0 M$_\odot$. The ``head'' of the Snake conforms to a canonical initial mass function with a power-law slope of $\alpha\sim-2.3$. Extending towards the ``tail,'' the MF becomes more top-light, indicating a deficiency of massive stars within these clusters. This result provides evidence for the delayed formation of massive stars in the clusters. Such clues give support to the hypothesis that the Stellar Snake constitutes as a hierarchically primordial structure. |
