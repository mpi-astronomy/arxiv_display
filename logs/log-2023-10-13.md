|**Abstract**| It has been shown in previous publications that the TNG100 simulation quantitatively reproduces the observed reduction in each of the total atomic and total molecular hydrogen gas for galaxies within massive halos, i.e.~dense environments. In this Letter, we study how well TNG50 reproduces the resolved effects of a Virgo-like cluster environment on the gas surface densities of satellite galaxies with $m_* > \! 10^9\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and ${\rm SFR} \! > 0.05\,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. We select galaxies in the simulation that are analogous to those in the HERACLES and VERTICO surveys, and mock-observe them to the common specifications of the data. Although TNG50 does not quantitatively match the observed gas surface densities in the centers of galaxies, the simulation does qualitatively reproduce the trends of gas truncation and central density suppression seen in VERTICO in both HI and H$_2$. This result promises that modern cosmological hydrodynamic simulations can be used to reliably model the post-infall histories of cluster satellite galaxies. |

|| Z. Ren, et al. -- incl., <mark>S. Li</mark> |

|*Comments*| *15 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal*|
|**Abstract**| We studied the unique kinematic properties in massive filament G352.63-1.07 at $10^3$-AU spatial scale with the dense molecular tracers observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We find the central massive core M1 (12 $M_\odot$) being separated from the surrounding filament with a velocity difference of $v- {v}_{sys}=-2$ km/s and a transverse separation within 3 arcsec. Meanwhile, as shown in multiple dense-gas tracers, M1 has a spatial extension closely aligned with the main filament and is connected to the filament towards its both ends. M1 thus represents a very beginning state for a massive young star-forming core escaping from the parental filament, within a time scale of $\sim 4000$ years. Based on its kinetic energy ($3.5\times10^{44}$ erg), the core escape is unlikely solely due to the original filament motion or magnetic field, but requires more energetic events such as a rapid intense anisotropic collapse. The released energy also seems to noticeably increase the environmental turbulence. This may help the filament to become stabilized again. |

|**Abstract**| We provide a complementary nested sampling analysis for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope lensing data release 6. This allows the quantification of global consistency statistics between ACT lensing and alternative datasets. In the context of flat $\Lambda$CDM, we find no inconsistency between ACT, Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, Planck anisotropies, weak lensing datasets, or NPIPE lensing. As part of our analysis, we also investigate the effect of the prior widths used in the ACT analysis and find that the headline results are quantitatively but not qualitatively affected by the chosen priors. We use both Bayes factors and the suspiciousness statistic to quantify the possibility of tension, and find suspiciousness unsuitable in the case of strong agreement between ACT DR6 and NPIPE. Nested sampling provides a competitive alternative to Metropolis Hastings and we recommend it be used alongside existing analyses. We release the chains and plotting source for the analysis using anesthetic. |
