|**Abstract**|            The presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs, $M_\text{BH}\sim10^9 M_\odot$) at $z>7$ remains a puzzle. While their existence appears to require exotic formation or growth processes, it is possible that BH mass estimates are incorrect due to differences from the low-$z$ quasars where BH mass scaling relations are calibrated. In this work, we employ JWST MIRI-MRS spectroscopy to measure the rest-frame optical/IR properties of the four highest-redshift known luminous type-1 quasars at $7.08\leq z<7.64$. We use three new broad lines to measure updated BH masses, H$\alpha$, Pa$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$, finding them to be in the range $(4-15)\cdot10^8 M_\odot$. Our black hole mass estimates from all tracers agree with each other and with previous, less accurate, ground-based measurements based on MgII. The flux ratios of the H lines deviate from expectations for case A and B recombination in the same way as in $z<3$ quasars, indicating similar physical conditions in the Broad Line Region. Rest-frame near-IR continuum emission from a hot dusty torus surrounding the accretion disc is unambiguously detected in all four objects. We model the emission with SKIRTOR and constrain the inclination (face-on) and the opening angle ($\theta=40-60^\circ$) of the tori. These constraints are consistent for the four objects and with expectations from luminous quasars. We estimate a total dust mass $(1-4)\cdot10^6 M_\odot$ in the tori, corresponding to $(0.2-7)\%$ of the total dust in the quasar host galaxies. Given observed accretion rates, these SMBHs will deplete their tori in only $\sim5$ Myr. Overall, we confirm that $z>7$ SMBHs in quasars could not have grown from stellar-remnant BHs if the radiative efficiency of accretion is $10\%$. We also find no evidence that inferred BH masses and accretion processes in $z>7$ quasars differ significantly from their near-identical counterparts at $z<3$.         |

|**Abstract**|            The evolution of the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) is a powerful probe of early star formation and stellar mass build-up. At z > 6, its bright end (MUV < -21) remains poorly constrained due to the small volumes of existing near-infrared (NIR) space-based surveys. The Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs) will cover 53 deg^2 with NIR imaging down to 26.5 AB, increasing area by a factor of 100 over previous space-based surveys. They thus offer an unprecedented opportunity to select bright z > 6 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and constrain the UV LF's bright end. With NIR coverage extending to 2um, Euclid can detect galaxies out to z = 13. We present forecasts for the number densities of z > 6 galaxies expected in the final EDF dataset. Using synthetic photometry from spectral energy distribution (SED) templates of z = 5--15 galaxies, z = 1--4 interlopers, and Milky Way MLT dwarfs, we explore optimal selection methods for high-z LBGs. A combination of S/N cuts with SED fitting (from optical to MIR) yields the highest-fidelity sample, recovering >76% of input z > 6 LBGs while keeping low-z contamination <10%. This excludes instrumental artefacts, which will affect early Euclid releases. Auxiliary data are critical: optical imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam and Vera C. Rubin Observatory distinguishes genuine Lyman breaks, while Spitzer/IRAC data help recover z > 10 sources. Based on empirical double power-law LF models, we expect >100,000 LBGs at z = 6-12 and >100 at z > 12 in the final Euclid release. In contrast, steeper Schechter models predict no z > 12 detections. We also present two ultra-luminous (MUV < -23.5) candidates from the EDF-N Q1 dataset. If their redshifts are confirmed, their magnitudes support a DPL LF model at z > 9, highlighting Euclid's power to constrain the UV LF's bright end and identify the most luminous early galaxies for follow-up.         |

|**Abstract**|            Using the large statistics provided by both Euclid and the LOFAR surveys, we present the first large-scale study of the connection between radio emission, its morphology, and the merging properties of the hosts of radio sources up to z=2. By dividing the radio sample into active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies, we find that radio-emitting AGN show a clear preference to reside within galaxies undergoing a merging event. This is more significant for AGN that present extended and/or complex radio emission: indeed, about half of them are associated with merging systems, while only 15% are hosted by an isolated galaxy. The observed trend is primarily driven by AGN residing at z < 1, especially in the case of high - P144MHz > 10^24 W Hz-1 sr-1 - radio luminosities (60% in mergers versus 10% isolated regardless of radio appearance). The situation is reversed in the case of radio-emitting star-forming galaxies, which are preferentially associated with isolated systems. This is more significant as we move towards low radio-luminosity/star-formation objects (P144MHz < 10^23 W Hz-1 sr-1) for which we find 40% in isolated systems versus 20% in mergers. These values hold regardless of redshift. We interpret the above result for AGN with their need to accrete outer gas from local encounters in order to trigger (radio) activity, especially in the case of extended radio emission such as hot-spots and lobes. This is mostly observed at z < 1, since in the local Universe galaxies are more gas deprived than their higher-redshift counterparts. Internal gas reservoirs instead seem sufficient to trigger star formation within the majority of galaxies, which indeed prefer to be associated with isolated systems at all redshifts probed.

|**Abstract**|            Massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) are believed to form primarily through mergers of less massive progenitors, leaving behind numerous traces of violent formation histories, such as stellar streams and shells. A particularly striking signature of these mergers is the formation of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, which can create depleted stellar cores through interactions with stars on radial orbits - a process known as core scouring. The secondary SMBH in such systems may still carry a dense stellar envelope and thereby remain observable for some time as a secondary nucleus, while it is sinking towards the shared gravitational potential of the merged galaxy. We leverage Euclid's Q1 Early Release data to systematically search for secondary nuclei in ETGs. We present a preliminary sample of 666 candidate systems distributed over 504 hosts (some of which contain multiple secondary nuclei). The vast majority of these fall at separations of 3 kpc to 15 kpc, indicative of normal mergers. 44 fall at projected separations of less than 2 kpc. We argue those candidates at very close angular separations are unlikely to be a consequence of chance alignments. We show that their stellar masses are mostly too large for them to be globular clusters and that a significant subset are unresolved even at Euclid's spatial resolution, rendering them too small to be dwarf galaxies. These may represent the highest-density nuclei of a previously merged galaxy, currently sinking into the centre of the new, common gravitational potential and thus likely to host a secondary SMBH. We then demonstrate that convolutional neural networks offer a viable avenue to detect multiple nuclei in the thirty-times larger sky coverage of the future Euclid DR1. Finally, we argue that our method could detect the remnants of a recoil event from two merged SMBHs.         |

|**Abstract**|            The first Euclid Quick Data Release contains millions of galaxies with excellent optical and near-infrared (IR) coverage. To complement this dataset, we investigate the average far-IR properties of Euclid-selected main sequence (MS) galaxies using existing Herschel and SCUBA-2 data. We use 17.6deg$^2$ (2.4deg$^2$) of overlapping Herschel (SCUBA-2) data, containing 2.6 million (240000) MS galaxies. We bin the Euclid catalogue by stellar mass and photometric redshift and perform a stacking analysis following SimStack, which takes into account galaxy clustering and bin-to-bin correlations. We detect stacked far-IR flux densities across a significant fraction of the bins. We fit modified blackbody spectral energy distributions in each bin and derive mean dust temperatures, dust masses, and star-formation rates (SFRs). We find similar mean SFRs compared to the Euclid catalogue, and we show that the average dust-to-stellar mass ratios decreased from z$\simeq$1 to the present day. Average dust temperatures are largely independent of stellar mass and are well-described by the function $T_2+(T_1-T_2){\rm e}^{-t/\tau}$, where $t$ is the age of the Universe, $T_1=79.7\pm7.4$K, $T_2=23.2\pm0.1$K, and $\tau=1.6\pm0.1$Gyr. We argue that since the dust temperatures are converging to a non-zero value below $z=1$, the dust is now primarily heated by the existing cooler and older stellar population, as opposed to hot young stars in star-forming regions at higher redshift. We show that since the dust temperatures are independent of stellar mass, the correlation between dust temperature and SFR depends on stellar mass. Lastly, we estimate the contribution of the Euclid catalogue to the cosmic IR background (CIB), finding that it accounts for >60% of the CIB at 250, 350, and 500$\mu$m. Forthcoming Euclid data will extend these results to higher redshifts, lower stellar masses, and recover more of the CIB.         |

|**Abstract**|            This study explores a rare population of sources in a currently uncharted region of spectroscopic redshift space in the Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1), and is intended potentially to support upcoming spectroscopic studies. Our goal is to identify and investigate a population of sources characterised by highly ionised emission lines in their spectra, which are indicative of active galactic nucleus activity, extreme shock phenomena, or Wolf--Rayet stars. A comprehensive visual inspection of spectra is conducted to ensure the reliability of the sample, focusing on the simultaneous detection of both NeV and OII emission-line measurements, a condition that restricts the Euclid spectroscopic redshift range to z=2.48--3.88. To characterise this population, we analysed the morpho-spectrophotometric properties of their host galaxies. This allowed for a direct comparison with control sources that exhibit similar OII properties and spectroscopic redshifts, but not NeV lines. We identify sources solely based on spectroscopic criteria in the redshift range beyond the Halpha regime. Encompassing 65 potential NeV candidates, the resulting sample delivers the first systematic probe of these NeV candidate emitters at high redshift. We found a good agreement, within 1$\sigma$, between the spectral measurements calculated using both direct integration and Gaussian fitting methodologies. The NeV candidates exhibit colours similar to bright QSOs, with only a few in the tail of very red quasars. We observed a higher stellar mass content, a lower continuum around the 4000A break, and a similar Sérsic index distribution compared to the control sample. This unique sample paves the way for a wide range of scientific investigations, which will be pursued in the forthcoming data releases.         |

|**Abstract**|            Strong gravitational lensing (SL) by galaxy clusters is a powerful probe of their inner mass distribution and a key test bed for cosmological models. However, the detection of SL events in wide-field surveys such as Euclid requires robust, automated methods capable of handling the immense data volume generated. In this work, we present an advanced deep learning (DL) framework based on mask region-based convolutional neural networks (Mask R-CNNs), designed to autonomously detect and segment bright, strongly-lensed arcs in Euclid's multi-band imaging of galaxy clusters. The model is trained on a realistic simulated data set of cluster-scale SL events, constructed by injecting mock background sources into Euclidised Hubble Space Telescope images of 10 massive lensing clusters, exploiting their high-precision mass models constructed with extensive spectroscopic data. The network is trained and validated on over 4500 simulated images, and tested on an independent set of 500 simulations, as well as real Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) observations. The trained network achieves high performance in identifying gravitational arcs in the test set, with a precision and recall of 76% and 58%, respectively, processing 2'x2' images in a fraction of a second. When applied to a sample of visually confirmed Euclid Q1 cluster-scale lenses, our model recovers 66% of gravitational arcs above the area threshold used during training. While the model shows promising results, limitations include the production of some false positives and challenges in detecting smaller, fainter arcs. Our results demonstrate the potential of advanced DL computer vision techniques for efficient and scalable arc detection, enabling the automated analysis of SL systems in current and future wide-field surveys. The code, ARTEMIDE, is open source and will be available at this http URL.         |

|**Abstract**|            High-contrast imaging relies on advanced coronagraphs and adaptive optics (AO) to attenuate the starlight. However, residual aberrations, especially non-common path aberrations between the AO channel and the coronagraph channel, limit the instrument performance. While post-processing techniques such as spectral or angular differential imaging (ADI) can partially address those issues, they suffer from self-subtraction and inefficiencies at small angular separations or when observations are conducted far from transit. We previously demonstrated the on-sky performance of coherent differential imaging (CDI), which offers a promising alternative. It allows for isolating coherent starlight residuals through speckle modulation, which can then be subtracted from the raw images during post-processing. This work aims to validate a CDI method on real science targets, demonstrating its effectiveness in imaging almost face-on circumstellar disks, which are typically challenging to retrieve with ADI. We temporally modulated the speckle field in VLT/SPHERE images, applying small phase offsets on the AO deformable mirror while observing stars surrounded by circumstellar material: HR 4796A, CPD-36 6759, HD 169142, and HD 163296. We hence separated the astrophysical scene from the stellar speckle field, whose lights are mutually incoherent. Combining a dozen of data frames and reference coronagraph point spread functions through a Karhunen-Loève image projection framework, we recover the circumstellar disks without the artifacts that are usually introduced by common post-processing algorithms (e.g., self-subtraction). The CDI method therefore represents a promising strategy for calibrating the effect of static and quasi-static aberrations in future direct imaging surveys. Indeed, it is efficient, does not require frequent telescope slewing, and does not introduce image artifacts to first order.         |

|| A. Wilde, et al. -- incl., <mark>F. Walter</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-11-06*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted to the Astrophysical Journal*|
|**Abstract**|            We present a study determining the spatial offset between the position of the supermassive black hole (as traced through their broad line regions) and the host galaxy in six $z > 6$ quasars. We determined the host galaxy's position from $\lesssim$$0.1^{\prime\prime}$ ($\lesssim$ 600 pc) resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) [CII] 158 $\mu m$ and corresponding dust continuum imaging. We determined the quasar's position from $\lesssim$ 400 pc resolution James Webb Space Telescope Near-Infrared Camera (JWST NIRCam) imaging. We estimated the observational uncertainties on the quasar's position using astrometric data from the Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics (GAIA) of field stars within the NIRCam images. We find that all six quasars are found within the central $\sim 400$ pc of their host galaxy dust continuum and [CII] emission. Apparent offsets seen in rest-frame optical JWST observations are not detected in our ALMA data, suggesting they likely result from dust obscuration rather than a true physical separation between the SMBH and its host galaxy. Kinematic modeling of these data further reveals that none of the galaxies show evidence for recent merger activity, and most of the galaxies can be accurately modeled using a simple disk model. The lack of an offset supports theoretical models that predict that positional offset within these galaxies are either short-lived or intrinsically rare.         |

|**Abstract**|            Stellar binaries in galactic centers are relevant to several observable phenomena, including hypervelocity stars, X-ray binaries, and mergers of stars and compact objects; however, we know little about the properties of these binaries. Past works have suggested that a small fraction of them should contract to a few stellar radii or collide, due to the co-operation of stellar tides and the eccentricity oscillations induced by the strong tidal field of the central massive black hole. We revisit this model with several updates. We first argue that when a binary's pericenter separation is driven down to a few stellar radii, diffusive excitation of stellar tides should quickly contract the orbit, saving the stars from collision. Instead, the stars should end up as a very tight binary. We then show that vector resonant relaxation and perturbations from passing stars -- effects not included in past models -- dramatically increase the prevalence of such encounters. In numerical experiments, we find that 1 in 5 binaries around 1 pc from Sgr A* should tidally contract in this way while still on the main sequence. This rate climbs to 3 in 5 around 0.01 pc, inward of which it plateaus. We briefly discuss observable implications of these results, with particular attention to young stellar binaries in the Galactic Center.         |

|**Abstract**|            We introduce a mock galaxy catalog built for the CSST extragalactic surveys using the primary runs of the Jiutian $N$-body simulation suites. The catalogs are built by coupling the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) semi-analytical model of galaxy formation with merger trees extracted from the simulations using the Hierarchical Bound-Tracing (HBT+) algorithm. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and broadband magnitudes are computed using the neural-network-based stellar population synthesizer StarDuster, which is trained on radiative transfer simulations to account for detailed galaxy geometry in modeling dust obscuration. Galaxy light-cones up to $z=5$ are subsequently generated with the BLiC light-cone builder which interpolates the properties of galaxies over time using an optimized interpolation scheme. The resulting catalogs exhibit good convergence in many statistical properties of the galaxy population produced from two different resolution simulations. The catalogs reproduce a number of observed galaxy properties across a range of galaxy mass and redshift, including the stellar mass functions, the luminosity function, gas mass fraction, galaxy size-mass relation and galaxy clustering. We also present the photometric and redshift distributions of galaxies expected to be observed in the CSST surveys.         |
