|**Abstract**| The formation of the first supermassive black holes is expected to have occurred in some most pronounced matter and galaxy overdensities in the early universe. We have conducted a sub-mm wavelength continuum survey of 54 $z\sim6$ quasars using the Submillimeter Common-User Bolometre Array-2 (SCUBA2) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) to study the environments around $z \sim 6$ quasars. We identified 170 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) with above 3.5$\sigma$ detections at 450 or 850 \um\, maps. Their FIR luminosities are 2.2 - 6.4 $\times$ 10$^{12} L_{\odot}$, and star formation rates are $\sim$ 400 - 1200 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We also calculated the SMGs differential and cumulative number counts in a combined area of $\sim$ 620 arcmin$^2$. To a $4\sigma$ detection (at $\sim$ 5.5 mJy), SMGs overdensity is $0.68^{+0.21}_{-0.19}$($\pm0.19$), exceeding the blank field source counts by a factor of 1.68. We find that 13/54 quasars show overdensities (at $\sim$ 5.5 mJy) of $\delta_{SMG}\sim$ 1.5 - 5.4. The combined area of these 13 quasars exceeds the blank field counts with the overdensity to 5.5 mJy of \dsmg $\sim$ $2.46^{+0.64}_{-0.55}$($\pm0.25$) in the regions of $\sim$ 150 arcmin$^2$. However, the excess is insignificant on the bright end (e.g., 7.5 mJy). We also compare results with previous environmental studies of Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) and Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBGs) on a similar scale. Our survey presents the first systematic study of the environment of quasars at $z\sim6$. The newly discovered SMGs provide essential candidates for follow-up spectroscopic observations to test whether they reside in the same large-scale structures as the quasars and search for protoclusters at an early epoch. |

|**Abstract**| This article provides a review on X-ray pulsar-based navigation (XNAV). The review starts with the basic concept of XNAV, and briefly introduces the past, present and future projects concerning XNAV. This paper focuses on the advances of the key techniques supporting XNAV, including the navigation pulsar database, the X-ray detection system, and the pulse time of arrival estimation. Moreover, the methods to improve the estimation performance of XNAV are reviewed. Finally, some remarks on the future development of XNAV are provided. |

|**Abstract**| We inspect 4 microlensing events KMT-2021-BLG-1968, KMT-2021-BLG-2010, KMT-2022-BLG-0371, and KMT-2022-BLG-1013, for which the light curves exhibit partially covered short-term central anomalies. We conduct detailed analyses of the events with the aim of revealing the nature of the anomalies. We test various models that can give rise to the anomalies of the individual events including the binary-lens (2L1S) and binary-source (1L2S) interpretations. Under the 2L1S interpretation, we thoroughly inspect the parameter space to check the existence of degenerate solutions, and if they exist, we test the feasibility of resolving the degeneracy. We find that the anomalies in KMT-2021-BLG-2010 and KMT-2022-BLG-1013 are uniquely defined by planetary-lens interpretations with the planet-to-host mass ratios of $q\sim 2.8\times 10^{-3}$ and $\sim 1.6\times 10^{-3}$, respectively. For KMT-2022-BLG-0371, a planetary solution with a mass ratio $q\sim 4\times 10^{-4}$ is strongly favored over the other three degenerate 2L1S solutions with different mass ratios based on the $\chi^2$ and relative proper motion arguments, and a 1L2S solution is clearly ruled out. For KMT-2021-BLG-1968, on the other hand, we find that the anomaly can be explained either by a planetary or a binary-source interpretation, making it difficult to firmly identify the nature of the anomaly. From the Bayesian analyses of the identified planetary events, we estimate that the masses of the planet and host are $(M_{\rm p}/M_{\rm J}, M_{\rm h}/M_\odot) = (1.07^{+1.15}_{-0.68}, 0.37^{+0.40}_{-0.23})$, $(0.26^{+0.13}_{-0.11}, 0.63^{+0.32}_{-0.28})$, and $(0.31^{+0.46}_{-0.16}, 0.18^{+0.28}_{-0.10})$ for KMT-2021-BLG-2010L, KMT-2022-BLG-0371L, and KMT-2022-BLG-1013L, respectively. |
