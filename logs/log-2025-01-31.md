|**Abstract**|            Context: How planets form in protoplanetary disks and what drives the formation of their seeds is still a major unknown. It is an accepted theory that multiple processes can trap dusty material in radially narrow rings or vortex-like structures, preventing the dust from drifting inwards. However, the relevant process for clumping this dusty material until it collapses under gravity still needs to be identified. One promising candidate is the streaming instability arising from the aerodynamic interaction between dust and gas once they reach similar densities. Aims: We investigate with a global disk model based on recent observational constraints if streaming instability can form dust clumps, which might gravitationally collapse. Further, our goal is to verify the observability of the produced structures using ALMA or ngVLA. Methods. For the first time, we present global 2D (R, z) hydrodynamic simulations using FARGO3D in which the dust is treated as a pressureless fluid. The disk model assumes stratification, realistic boundary conditions, and meaningful resolution to resolve the fast-growing modes. We choose two values for the total dust-to-gas mass ratio Z = 0.01 and Z = 0.02, compare the maximum clump density to the local Hill density, and compute the optical depth of the dust disk. Results: With a dust-to-gas mass ratio of Z = 0.01, we confirm previous streaming instability simulations, not showing the ability to form strong concentrations of dust clumps. With Z = 0.02, dense clumps form within 20 orbits, however reaching only 30% of the Hill density even following disk parameters from the massive protoplanetary disks GM Aur, HD163296, IM Lup, MWC 480, and TW Hya, which all share astonishingly similar surface density profiles.         |

|**Abstract**|            Sub-Neptunes are the most common type of planet in our galaxy. Interior structure models suggest that the coldest sub-Neptunes could host liquid water oceans underneath their hydrogen envelopes - sometimes called 'hycean' planets. JWST transmission spectra of the $\sim$ 250 K sub-Neptune K2-18 b were recently used to report detections of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$, alongside weaker evidence of (CH$_3$)$_2$S (dimethyl sulfide, or DMS). Atmospheric CO$_2$ was interpreted as evidence for a liquid water ocean, while DMS was highlighted as a potential biomarker. However, these notable claims were derived using a single data reduction and retrieval modeling framework, which did not allow for standard robustness tests. Here we present a comprehensive reanalysis of K2-18 b's JWST NIRISS SOSS and NIRSpec G395H transmission spectra, including the first analysis of the second-order NIRISS SOSS data. We incorporate multiple well-tested data reduction pipelines and retrieval codes, spanning 60 different data treatments and over 250 atmospheric retrievals. We confirm the detection of CH$_4$ ($\approx$ 4$\sigma$), with a volume mixing ratio of log CH$_4$ = $-1.15^{+0.40}_{-0.52}$, but we find no statistically significant or reliable evidence for CO$_2$ or DMS. Finally, we quantify the observed atmospheric composition using photochemical-climate and interior models, demonstrating that our revised composition of K2-18 b can be explained by an oxygen-poor mini-Neptune without requiring a liquid water surface or life.         |

|**Abstract**|            Context. Quasar outflows play a significant role in the active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, impacting the interstellar medium and potentially influencing galaxy evolution. Characterizing these outflows is essential for understanding AGN-driven processes. Aims. We aim to analyze the physical properties of the mini-broad absorption line outflow in quasar J1402+2330 using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. We seek to measure the outflows location, energetics, and potential impact on AGN feedback processes. Methods. In the spectrum of J1402+2330, we identify multiple ionic absorption lines, including ground and excited states. We measure the ionic column densities and then use photoionization models to determine the total hydrogen column density and ionization parameter of the outflow. We utilized the population ratio of the excited state to the ground state of N iii and S iv to determine the electron number density. Results. The derived electron number density, combined with the ionization parameter, indicates an outflow distance of approximately 2200 pc from the central source. Having a mass outflow rate of more than one thousand solar masses per year and a kinetic energy output exceeding 5 percent of the Eddington luminosity, this outflow can significantly contribute to AGN feedback. Conclusions. Our findings suggest the absorption outflow in J1402+2330 plays a potentially significant role in AGN feedback processes. This study highlights the value of DESI data in exploring AGN feedback mechanisms.         |
