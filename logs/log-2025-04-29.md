|**Abstract**|            We present the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) for a parent sample of 604 galaxies at $z=5.34-6.94$ with [\text{O}~\textsc{iii}] doublets detected, using the deep JWST/NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopic (WFSS) observations in 26 quasar fields. The sample incorporates the full observations of 25 quasar fields from JWST Cycle 1 GO program ASPIRE and the quasar SDSS J0100+2802 from JWST EIGER program. We identify 204 galaxies residing in overdense structures using friends-of-friends (FoF) algorithm. We estimate the electron temperature of $2.0^{+0.3}_{-0.4}\times10^4$ K from the Hg and $[\text{O}~\textsc{iii}]_{4363}$ lines in the stacked spectrum, indicating a metal-poor sample with median gas phase metallicity 12+$\log(\mathrm{O/H})=7.64^{+0.23}_{-0.11}$. With the most up-to-date strong line calibration based on NIRSpec observations, we find that the MZR shows a metal enhancement of $\sim0.2$ dex at high mass end in overdense environments. However, compared to the local Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), our galaxy sample at $z>5$ shows a metal deficiency of $\sim0.2$ dex relative to FMR predictions. We explain the observed trend of FMR with a simple analytical model, and we favor dilution from intense gas accretion over outflow to explain the metallicity properties at $z>5$. Those high redshift galaxies are likely in a rapid gas accretion phase when their metal and gas contents are in a non-equilibrium state. According to model predictions, the protocluster members are closer to the gas equilibrium state than field galaxies and thus have higher metallicity and are closer to the local FMR. Our results suggest that the accelerated star formation during protocluster assembly likely plays a key role in shaping the observed MZR and FMR, indicating a potentially earlier onset of metal enrichment in overdense environments at $z\approx5-7$.         |

|**Abstract**|            Forward modeling is often used to interpret substructures observed in protoplanetary disks. To ensure the robustness and consistency of the current forward modeling approach from the community, we conducted a systematic comparison of various hydrodynamics and radiative transfer codes. Using four grid-based hydrodynamics codes (FARGO3D, Idefix, Athena++, PLUTO) and a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code (Phantom), we simulated a protoplanetary disk with an embedded giant planet. We then used two radiative transfer codes (mcfost, RADMC-3D) to calculate disk temperatures and create synthetic 12CO cubes. Finally, we retrieved the location of the planet from the synthetic cubes using DISCMINER. We found strong consistency between the hydrodynamics codes, particularly in the density and velocity perturbations associated with planet-driven spirals. We also found a good agreement between the two radiative transfer codes: the disk temperature in mcfost and RADMC-3D models agrees within $\lesssim 3~\%$ everywhere in the domain. In synthetic $^{12}$CO channel maps, this results in brightness temperature differences within $\pm1.5$ K in all our models. This good agreement ensures consistent retrieval of planet's radial/azimuthal location with only a few % of scatter, with velocity perturbations varying $\lesssim 20~\%$ among the models. Notably, while the planet-opened gap is shallower in the Phantom simulation, we found that this does not impact the planet location retrieval. In summary, our results demonstrate that any combination of the tested hydrodynamics and radiative transfer codes can be used to reliably model and interpret planet-driven kinematic perturbations.         |

|**Abstract**|            Planet formation is a hugely dynamic process requiring the transport, concentration and assimilation of gas and dust to form the first planetesimals and cores. With access to extremely high spatial and spectral resolution observations at unprecedented sensitivities, it is now possible to probe the planet forming environment in detail. To this end, the exoALMA Large Program targeted fifteen large protoplanetary disks ranging between ${\sim}1\arcsec$ and ${\sim}7\arcsec$ in radius, and mapped the gas and dust distributions. $^{12}$CO J=3-2, $^{13}$CO J=3-2 and CS J=7-6 molecular emission was imaged at high angular (${\sim}~0\farcs15$) and spectral (${\sim}~100~{\rm m\,s^{-1}}$) resolution, achieving a surface brightness temperature sensitivity of ${\sim}1.5$~K over a single channel, while the 330~GHz continuum emission was imaged at 90~mas resolution and achieved a point source sensitivity of ${\sim}\,40~\mu{\rm Jy~beam^{-1}}$. These observations constitute some of the deepest observations of protoplanetary disks to date. Extensive substructure was found in all but one disk, traced by both dust continuum and molecular line emission. In addition, the molecular emission allowed for the velocity structure of the disks to be mapped with excellent precision (uncertainties on the order of $10~{\rm m\,s^{-1}}$), revealing a variety of kinematic perturbations across all sources. From this sample it is clear that, when observed in detail, all disks appear to exhibit physical and dynamical substructure indicative of on-going dynamical processing due to young, embedded planets, large-scale, (magneto-)hydrodynamical instabilities or winds.         |

|**Abstract**|            We analyze the $^{12}$CO $J=3-2$ data cubes of the disks in the exoALMA program. 13/15 disks reveal a variety of kinematic substructures in individual channels: large-scale arcs or spiral arms, localized velocity kinks, and/or multiple faints arcs that appear like filamentary structures on the disk surface. We find kinematic signatures that are consistent with planet wakes in six disks: AA Tau, SY Cha, J1842, J1615, LkCa 15 and HD 143006. Comparison with hydrodynamical and radiative transfer simulations suggests planets with orbital radii between 80 and 310\,au and masses between 1 and 5 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$. Additional kinematic substructures limit our ability to place tight constraints on the planet masses. When the inclination is favorable to separate the upper and lower surfaces (near 45$^\mathrm{o}$, i.e. in 7/15 disks), we always detect the vertical CO snowline and find that the $^{12}$CO freeze-out is partial in the disk midplane, with a depletion factor of $\approx 10^{-3}$ - $10^{-2}$ compared to the warm molecular layer. In these same seven disks, we also systematically detect evidence of CO desorption in the outer regions.         |

|**Abstract**|            The exoALMA Large Program targeted a sample of 15 disks to study gas dynamics within these systems, and these observations simultaneously produced continuum data at 0.9 mm (331.6 GHz) with exceptional surface brightness sensitivity at high angular resolution. To provide a robust characterization of the observed substructures, we performed a visibility space analysis of the continuum emission from the exoALMA data, characterizing axisymmetric substructures and nonaxisymmetric residuals obtained by subtracting an axisymmetric model from the observed data. We defined a nonaxisymmetry index and found that the most asymmetric disks predominantly show an inner cavity and consistently present higher values of mass accretion rate and near-infrared excess. This suggests a connection between outer disk dust substructures and inner disk properties. The depth of the data allowed us to describe the azimuthally averaged continuum emission in the outer disk, revealing that larger disks (both in dust and gas) in our sample tend to be gradually tapered compared to the sharper outer edge of more compact sources. Additionally, the data quality revealed peculiar features in various sources, such as shadows, inner disk offsets, tentative external substructures, and a possible dust cavity wall.         |

|**Abstract**|            The exoALMA large program offers a unique opportunity to investigate the fundamental properties of protoplanetary disks, such as their masses and sizes, providing important insights in the mechanism responsible for the transport of angular momentum. In this work, we model the rotation curves of CO isotopologues $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO of ten sources within the exoALMA sample, and we constrain the stellar mass, the disk mass and the density scale radius through precise characterization of the pressure gradient and disk self gravity. We obtain dynamical disk masses for our sample measuring the self-gravitating contribution to the gravitational potential. We are able to parametrically describe their surface density, and all of them appear gravitationally stable. By combining dynamical disk masses with dust continuum emission data, we determine an averaged gas-to-dust ratio of approximately 400, not statistically consistent with the standard value of 100, assuming optically thin dust emission. In addition, the measurement of the dynamical scale radius allows for direct comparison with flux-based radii of gas and dust. This comparison suggests that substructures may influence the size of the dust disk, and that CO depletion might reconcile our measurements with thermochemical models. Finally, with the stellar mass, disk mass, scale radius, and accretion rate, and assuming self-similar evolution of the surface density, we constrain the effective $\alpha_S$ for these systems. We find a broad range of $\alpha_S$ values ranging between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-2}$.         |

|**Abstract**|            The planet-hunting ALMA large program exoALMA observed 15 protoplanetary disks at ~0.15" angular resolution and ~100 m/s spectral resolution, characterizing disk structures and kinematics in enough detail to detect non-Keplerian features (NKFs) in the gas emission. As these features are often small and low-contrast, robust imaging procedures are critical for identifying and characterizing NKFs, including determining which features may be signatures of young planets. The exoALMA collaboration employed two different imaging procedures to ensure the consistent detection of NKFs: CLEAN, the standard iterative deconvolution algorithm, and regularized maximum likelihood (RML) imaging. This paper presents the exoALMA RML images, obtained by maximizing the likelihood of the visibility data given a model image and subject to regularizer penalties. Crucially, in the context of exoALMA, RML images serve as an independent verification of marginal features seen in the fiducial CLEAN images. However, best practices for synthesizing RML images of multi-channeled (i.e. velocity-resolved) data remain undefined, as prior work on RML imaging for protoplanetary disk data has primarily addressed single-image cases. We used the open source Python package MPoL to explore RML image validation methods for multi-channeled data and synthesize RML images from the exoALMA observations of 7 protoplanetary disks with apparent NKFs in the 12CO J=3-2 CLEAN images. We find that RML imaging methods independently reproduce the NKFs seen in the CLEAN images of these sources, suggesting that the NKFs are robust features rather than artifacts from a specific imaging procedure.         |

|**Abstract**|            The gas masses of protoplanetary disks are important but elusive quantities. In this work we present new ALMA observations of N2H+ (3-2) for 11 exoALMA disks. N2H+ is a molecule sensitive to CO freeze-out and has recently been shown to significantly improve the accuracy of gas masses estimated from CO line emission. We combine these new observations with archival N2H+ and CO isotopologue observations to measure gas masses for 19 disks, predominantly from the exoALMA Large program. For 15 of these disks the gas mass has also been measured using gas rotation curves. We show that the CO + N2H+ line emission-based gas masses typically agree with the kinematically measured ones within a factor 3 (1-2{\sigma}). Gas disk masses from CO + N2H+ are on average a factor 2.3(+0.7,-1.0) x lower than the kinematic disk masses, which could suggest slightly lower N2 abundances and/or lower midplane ionization rates than typically assumed. Herbig disks are found to have ISM level CO gas abundances based on their CO and N2H+ fluxes, which sets them apart from T-Tauri disks where abundances are typically 3-30x lower. The agreement between CO + N2H+ -based and kinematically measured gas masses is promising and shows that multi-molecule line fluxes are a robust tool to accurately measure disk masses at least for extended disks.         |

|**Abstract**|            Extracting robust inferences on physical quantities from disk kinematics measured from Doppler-shifted molecular line emission is challenging due to the data's size and complexity. In this paper we develop a flexible linear model of the intensity distribution in each frequency channel, accounting for spatial correlations from the point spread function. The analytic form of the model's posterior enables probabilistic data products through sampling. Our method debiases peak intensity, peak velocity, and line width maps, particularly in disk substructures that are only partially resolved. These are needed in order to measure disk mass, turbulence, pressure gradients, and to detect embedded planets. We analyse HD 135344B, MWC 758, and CQ Tau, finding velocity substructures 50--200 ${\rm m s^{-1}}$ greater than with conventional methods. Additionally, we combine our approach with discminer in a case study of J1842. We find that uncertainties in stellar mass and inclination increase by an order of magnitude due to the more realistic noise model. More broadly, our method can be applied to any problem requiring a probabilistic model of an intensity distribution conditioned on a point spread function.         |

|**Abstract**|            The gas surface density is one of the most relevant physical quantities in protoplanetary disks. However, its precise measurement remains highly challenging due to the lack of a direct tracer. In this study, we report the spatially-resolved detection of pressure-broadened line wings in the CO $J=3-2$ line in the RX J1604.3-2130 A transition disk as part of the exoALMA large program. Since pressure-broadened line wings are sensitive to the total gas volume density, we robustly constrain the radial dependence of the gas surface density and midplane pressure in the region located $50-110$ au from the central star, which encompasses the dust ring of the system. The peak radius of the midplane pressure profile matches the dust ring radial location, directly proving radial dust trapping at a gas pressure maximum. The peak gas surface density is $18-44\ {\rm g\ cm^{-2}}$} and decreases at radii interior to and exterior of the dust ring. A comparison of the gas and dust surface densities suggests that the disk turbulence is as low as $\alpha_{\rm turb} \sim 2\times10^{-4}$. Despite dust trapping, the gas-to-dust surface density ratio at the ring peak is { $70-400$}, which implies already-formed protoplanets and/or less efficient dust trapping. The gas surface density drop at radii interior to the ring is consistent with a gas gap induced by a Jupiter-mass planet. The total gas mass within $50 < r < 110$ au is estimated to be $\sim 0.05-0.1\ M_\odot$ ($50-100\ {M_{\rm Jup}}$), suggesting that planetary system formation is possible.         |

|**Abstract**|            SHARK-NIR is a new compact instrument for coronagraphic imaging, direct imaging, and coronagraphic spectroscopy in the near-infrared wavelengths mounted at LBT. Taking advantage of the telescope's adaptive optics system, it provides high contrast imaging with coronagraphic and spectroscopic capabilities and is focused on the direct imaging of exoplanets and circumstellar discs. We present SHINS, the SHARK-NIR instrument control software, mainly realized with the TwiceAsNice framework from MPIA - Heidelberg and the ICE framework using the C++ programming language. We describe how we implemented the software components controlling several instrument subsystems, through the adaptation of already tested libraries from other instruments at LBT, such as LINC-NIRVANA. The scientific detector comes with its own readout electronic and control software interfaced with our software through INDI. We describe the C++ core software Observation Control Software, responsible for dispatching commands to the subsystems, also implementing a software solution to avoid a potential collision between motorized components, fully transparent to final users. It exposes an ICE interface and can be controlled by clients developed in different languages. Observation, calibration, and maintenance procedures are implemented by means of template scripts, written in python language, controlling Observation Control Software through its ICE interface. These templates and their parameters are configured using "ESO-style", XML Observation Blocks prepared by observers, or in general SHARK-NIR users. The high-level control is carried out by REST HTTP APIs implemented in a python back-end, also acting as a web server for the several browser-based front-end GUIs. Finally, we present the first scientific results obtained by SHARK-NIR using coronagraphic mode.         |

|**Abstract**|            Turbulent gas motions drive planet formation and protoplanetary disk evolution. However, empirical constraints on turbulence are scarce, halting our understanding of its nature. Resolving signatures of the large-scale perturbations driven by disk instabilities may reveal clues on the origin of turbulence in the outer regions of planet-forming disks. We aim to predict the observational signatures of such large-scale flows, as they would appear in high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of CO rotational lines, such as those conducted by the exoALMA Large Program. Post-processing 3D numerical simulations, we explored the observational signatures produced by three candidate (magneto-)hydrodynamical instabilities to operate in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks: the vertical shear instability (VSI), the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), and the gravitational instability (GI). We found that exoALMA-quality observations should capture signatures of the large-scale motions induced by these instabilities. Mainly, flows with ring, arc, and spiral morphologies are apparent in the residuals of synthetic velocity centroid maps. A qualitative comparison between our predictions and the perturbations recovered from exoALMA data suggests the presence of two laminar disks and a scarcity of ring- and arc-like VSI signatures within the sample. Spiral features produced by the MRI or the GI are still plausible in explaining observed disk perturbations. Supporting these scenarios requires further methodically comparing the predicted perturbations and the observed disks' complex dynamic structure.         |

|**Abstract**|            In the past decade, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revealed a plethora of substructures in the disks surrounding young stars. These substructures have several proposed formation mechanisms, with one leading theory being the interaction between the disk and newly formed planets. In this Letter, we present high angular resolution ALMA observations of LkCa~15's disk that reveal a striking difference in dust and CO emission morphology. The dust continuum emission shows a ring-like structure characterized by a dust-depleted inner region of $\sim$40 au in radius. Conversely, the CO emission is radially smoother and shows no sign of gas depletion within the dust cavity. We compare the observations with models for the disk-planet interaction, including radiative transfer calculation in the dust and CO emission. This source is particularly interesting as the presence of massive planets within the dust cavity has been suggested based on previous NIR observations. We find that the level of CO emission observed within the dust cavity is inconsistent with the presence of planets more massive than Jupiter orbiting between 10-40 au. Instead, we argue that the LkCa~15 innermost dust cavity might be created either by a chain of low-mass planets, or by other processes that do not require the presence of planets.         |

|**Abstract**|            The exoALMA Large Program was designed to search for subtle kinematic deviations from Keplerian motion, indicative of embedded planets, in high angular and spectral resolution Band 7 observations of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and CS emission from protoplanetary disks. This paper summarizes the calibration and imaging pipelines used by the exoALMA collaboration. With sources ranging in diameter from 2.4" to 13.8" when probed by $^{12}$CO, multiple antennae configurations were required to maximally recover all spatial information (including the ACA for 7 sources). Combining these datasets warranted particular care in their alignment during calibration and prior to imaging, so as not to introduce spurious features that might resemble the kinematic deviations being investigated. Phase decoherence was found in several datasets, which was corrected by an iterative self-calibration procedure, and we explored the effects of the order of operations of spatial alignment, flux scaling, and self-calibration. A number of different imaging sets were produced for the continuum and line emission, employing an iterative masking procedure that minimizes bias due to non-Keplerian motions in the disk.         |

|**Abstract**|            Analysis of the gaseous component in protoplanetary disks can inform us about their thermal and physical structure, chemical composition, and kinematic properties, all of which are crucial for understanding various processes within the disks. By exploiting the asymmetry of the line emission, or via line profile analysis, we can locate the emitting surfaces. Here, we present the emission surfaces of the exoALMA sources in $^{12}$CO $J=3-2$, $^{13}$CO $J=3-2$, and CS $J=7-6$. We find that $^{12}$CO traces the upper disk atmosphere, with mean <$z/r$> values of $\approx$ 0.28, while $^{13}$CO and CS trace lower regions of the disk with mean <z/r> values of $\approx$ 0.16 and $\approx$ 0.18, respectively. We find that $^{12}$CO <$z/r$> and the disk mass are positively correlated with each other; this relationship offers a straightforward way to infer the disk mass. We derive 2-D $r-z$ temperature distributions of the disks. Additionally, we search for substructure in the surfaces and radial intensity profiles; we find evidence of localized substructure in the emission surfaces and peak intensity profiles of nearly every disk, with this substructure often being co-incident between molecular tracers, intensity profiles, and kinematic perturbations. Four disks display evidence of potential photo-desorption, implying that this effect may be common even in low FUV star-forming regions. For most disks, we find that the physical and thermal structure is more complex than analytical models can account for, highlighting a need for more theoretical work and a better understanding of the role of projection effects on our observations.         |

|**Abstract**|            The ALMA large program exoALMA offers a unique window into the three-dimensional physical and dynamical properties of 15 circumstellar disks where planets may be actively forming. Here, we present an analysis methodology to map the gas disk structure and substructure encoded in 12CO, 13CO, and CS line emission from our targets. To model and characterize the disk structure probed by optically thin species, such as CS and, in some cases, 13CO, we introduce a composite line profile kernel that accounts for increased intensities caused by the projected overlap between the disk's front and back side emission. Our workflow, built on the Discminer modelling framework, incorporates an improved iterative two-component fitting method for inclined sources ($i>40^\circ$), to mitigate the impact of the disk backside on the extraction of velocity maps. Also, we report best-fit parameters for the Keplerian stellar masses, as well as inclinations, position angles, systemic velocities, rotation direction, and emission surfaces of the disks in our sample.         |

|**Abstract**|            The availability of exquisite data and the development of new analysis techniques have enabled the study of emitting heights in proto-planetary disks. In this paper we introduce a simple model linking the emitting height of CO to the disk surface density and temperature structure. We then apply the model to measurements of the emitting height and disk temperature conducted as part of exoALMA, integrated with additional legacy measurements from the MAPS Large Programme, to derive CO column densities and surface density profiles (assuming a CO abundance) for a total of 14 disks. A unique feature of the method we introduce to measure surface densities is that it can be applied to optically thick observations, rather than optically thin as conventionally done. While we use our method on a sample of well studied disks where temperature structures have been derived using two emission lines, we show that reasonably accurate estimates can be obtained also when only one molecular transition is available. With our method we obtain independent constraints from $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO and we find they are in general good agreement using the standard $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratio. The masses derived from our method are systematically lower compared with the values derived dynamically from the rotation curve if using an ISM CO abundance, implying that CO is depleted by a median factor $\sim$20 with respect to the ISM value, in line with other works that find that CO is depleted in proto-planetary disks.         |

|**Abstract**|            The key planet-formation processes in protoplanetary disks remain an active matter of research. One promising mechanism to radially and azimuthally trap millimeter-emitting dust grains, enabling them to concentrate and grow into planetesimals, is anticyclonic vortices. While dust observations have revealed crescent structures in several disks, observations of their kinematic signatures are still lacking. Studying the gas dynamics is, however, essential to confirm the presence of a vortex and understand its dust trapping properties. In this work, we make use of the high-resolution and sensitivity observations conducted by the exoALMA large program to search for such signatures in the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO molecular line emission of four disks with azimuthal dust asymmetries: HD 135344B, HD 143006, HD 34282, and MWC 758. To assess the vortex features, we constructed an analytical vortex model and performed hydrodynamical simulations. For the latter, we assumed two scenarios: a vortex triggered at the edge of a dead zone and of a gap created by a massive embedded planet. These models reveal a complex kinematical morphology of the vortex. When compared to the data, we find that none of the sources show a distinctive vortex signature around the dust crescents in the kinematics.         |

|**Abstract**|            The bulk motion of the gas in protoplanetary disks around newborn stars is nearly Keplerian. By leveraging the high angular and spectral resolution of ALMA, we can detect small-scale velocity perturbations in molecular line observations caused by local gas pressure variations in the disk, possibly induced by embedded protoplanets. This paper presents the azimuthally averaged rotational velocity and its deviations from Keplerian rotation ($\delta\upsilon_{\phi}$) for the exoALMA sample, as measured in the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emission lines. The rotation signatures show evidence for vertically stratified disks, in which $^{13}$CO rotates faster than $^{12}$CO due to a distinct thermal gas pressure gradient at their emitting heights. We find $\delta\upsilon_{\phi}$-substructures in the sample on both small ($\sim$10 au) and large ($\sim$100 au) radial scales, reaching deviations up to 15% from background Keplerian velocity in the most extreme cases. More than 75% of the rings and 80% of the gaps in the dust continuum emission resolved in $\delta\upsilon_{\phi}$ are co-located with gas pressure maxima and minima, respectively. Additionally, gas pressure substructures are observed far beyond the dust continuum emission. For the first time, we determined the gas pressure derivative at the midplane from observations and found it to align well with the dust substructures within the given uncertainties. Based on our findings, we conclude that gas pressure variations are likely the dominant mechanism for ring and gap formation in the dust continuum.         |

|**Abstract**|            The gravitational potential is established as a critical determinant of gas-phase metallicity (12+log(O/H)) in low-redshift galaxies, whereas its influence remains unconfirmed at high redshifts. We investigate the correlation between gas-phase metallicity and effective radius ($R_{\rm e}$) for a sample of galaxies with redshifts ranging from 1 to 7, drawn from JADES (JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey) Data Release 3. We calculate the metallicities using four strong-line methods: ${\rm N2S2H\alpha}$, ${\rm R23}$, ${\rm N2}$, and ${\rm O3N2}$, respectively. After taking out the evolution of size, we find that the offsets of mass-size relation ($\Delta \log R_{\rm e}$) are significantly negatively correlated with the offset of mass-metallicity relation ($\Delta \log({\rm O/H})$) for the four metallicity tracers. Regardless of the metallicity tracer used, we obtain Spearman rank $p-$values much less than 0.01, rejecting the null hypothesis that the observed correlation is statistically nonsignificant and attributable to random chance. This is also true for galaxies with $z>3$, with $p-$values less than 0.05 for the four metallicity tracers. We for the first time find evidence of size playing a key role in determining gas-phase metallicity towards cosmic dawn, suggesting that the gravitational potential influences their material-exchange processes with the surrounding environment at very early universe.         |

|**Abstract**|            Rotating primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe can emit particles through superradiance, a process particularly efficient when the particle's Compton wavelength is comparable to the PBH's gravitational radius. Superradiance leads to an exponential growth of particle occupation numbers in gravitationally bound states. We present an analysis of heavy bosonic dark matter (DM) production through three gravitational mechanisms: Hawking radiation, superradiant instabilities, and ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in. We consider PBHs that evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For both scalar and vector DM, our analysis incorporates the evolution of a second superradiant mode. We demonstrate that the growth of a second superradiant mode causes the decay of the first mode, and thus the second mode cannot further enhance the DM abundance beyond that already achieved by the first mode. Our study also reveals that while superradiance generally enhances DM production, gravitational wave (GW) emission from the superradiant cloud may significantly modify this picture. For scalar DM, GW emission reduces the parameter space where superradiance effectively augments relic abundance. For vector DM, rapid GW emission from the superradiant cloud may yield relic abundances below those achieved through Hawking radiation alone. These findings demonstrate that multiple-mode effect and GW emission play critical roles in modeling DM production from PBHs in the early universe.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (\insight) detected GRB 221009A, the brightest gamma-ray burst observed to date, with all its three telescopes, i.e. High Energy telescope (HE, 20-250 keV), Medium Energy telescope (ME, 5-30 keV), and Low Energy telescope (LE, 1-10 keV). Here we present the detailed observation results of all three telescopes of \insight~ on the prompt emission of GRB 221009A. After dead-time and data saturation correction, we recovered the light curves of HE, ME and LE telescopes and find that they generally track the GECAM-C low gain light curves that are free of data saturation issues. Particularly, the ME light curve matches the GECAM-C light curve in low gain mode above 400 keV, while the LE light curve is more consistent with the GECAM-C above 1.5 MeV. Based on simulation, we find that the signals recorded by the ME and LE are actually caused by the secondary particles produced by the interaction between GRB gamma-ray photons and the material of the satellite. Interestingly, the consistency between ME and LE light curves and GECAM-C demonstrates that ME and LE data could be used to characterize the GRB properties. Espeically, the high time resolution light curve of ME allowed us, for the first time, to calculate the minimum variability timescale (MVT = 0.10 s) of the main burst episode of GRB 221009A.         |
