|**Abstract**|            The fifth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V) is conducting the first all-sky low-resolution spectroscopic survey of the Milky Way's stellar halo. We describe the stellar parameter pipeline for the SDSS-V halo survey, which simultaneously models spectra, broadband photometry, and parallaxes to derive stellar parameters, metallicities, alpha abundances, and distances. The resulting BOSS-MINESweeper catalog is validated across a wide range of stellar parameters and metallicities using star clusters and a comparison to high-resolution spectroscopic surveys. We demonstrate several scientific capabilities of this dataset: identifying the most chemically peculiar stars in our Galaxy, discovering and mapping distant halo substructures, and measuring the all--sky dynamics of the Milky Way on the largest scales. The BOSS-MINESweeper catalog for SDSS DR19 is publicly available and will be updated for future data releases.         |

|**Abstract**|            As part of the JWST GTO program MINDS, we analyze the mid-infrared emission of three Class II binary systems: VW Cha, WX Cha, and RW Aur, to investigate the impact of stellar multiplicity on the chemistry and physics of their inner disk. We analyze the 1D spectrum from JWST/MIRI-MRS for primary and secondary disks separately, extracted by combining forward modeling with a theoretical PSF and aperture photometry. We modeled the molecular lines with 0D slab models. We interpret the results by comparing our JWST spectra to VLT/CRIRES+, Spitzer/IRS, and ALMA. Primary and secondary disks are dramatically different in their mid-infrared emission, with primary disks showing H2O-rich spectra, and secondary disks being mostly line poor to the sensitivity of our spectra. When comparing MIRI-MRS to Spitzer/IRS, we observe large variability in the line emission of VW Cha A, as well as in the continuum of RW Aur A. The disks around VW Cha BC and RW Aur B show evidence of ionizing radiation, and a further comparison with ALMA at high angular resolution dust continuum suggest that the spectrum of RW Aur B is well explained by its ~4 au cavity. All the systems show [Ne II] jet emission, and three of them also show spatially resolved emission structures in H2, likely originated by outflows and dynamical interactions. Many of the observed features in the primary disks, such as enhanced water emission, could be linked to the increased accretion and radial drift produced by dynamical disk truncation. However, additional mechanisms are needed to explain the large differences between primary and secondary disks, potentially inner disk substructures. This work is an example of the need for combining multiple facilities to fully understand the observations from JWST.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Tianlai Cylinder Pathfinder Array consists of three adjacent cylindrical reflectors fixed on the ground, each 40 meters long and 15 meters wide, with the cylinder axis oriented along the North-South (N-S)direction. Dual linear polarisation feeds are distributed along the focus line, parallel to the cylinder axis. Measurement of the primary beam profile of these cylindrical reflectors is difficult, as they are too large to be placed in an anechoic chamber. While the beam profile along the East-West (E-W) direction can be measured with the transit observations of bright astronomical radio sources, the beam profile along the N-S direction remains very uncertain. We present a preliminary measurement of the beam profile of the Tianlai cylindrical antenna along both the N-S direction and E-W direction in the frequency range of 700-800 MHz, using a calibrator source carried by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flying in the far field. The beam profile of the Tianlai cylindrical antenna is determined from the analysis of the auto-correlation signals from the the cylinder array correlator, taking into account the emitter antenna beam profile, itself measured with a dipole antenna on the ground. The accuracy of the UAV-based determination of the cylinder beam profiles is validated by comparing the results with the one derived from bright astronomical source transits, and with simulated beams.         |

|| L. Li, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-08-05*|

|**Abstract**|            We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024gy, a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) exhibiting high-velocity features (HVFs) in its early-time spectra. This SN reaches a peak $B$-band magnitude of $-19.25 \pm 0.28$ mag and subsequently declines by $\Delta m_{15}(B) \approx 1.12$ mag, consistent with the luminosity-width relation characteristic of normal SNe Ia. Based on the peak thermal luminosity of $(1.2 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, we estimate that $0.57 \pm 0.14~\rm M_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni was synthesized during the explosion. Our dense early spectral monitoring revealed significant velocity disparities within the ejecta. Notably, absorption features from the \CaII\ near-infrared triplet were observed at velocities exceeding 25,000 km s$^{-1}$, while the \SiII\, \ld 6355 line velocity at the same epoch was significantly lower at $\sim$ 16,000 km s$^{-1}$. This velocity disparity likely reflects distinct ionization states of intermediate-mass elements in the outermost layers. The prominent \CaII\, HVFs may originate from ionization suppression within the highest-velocity ejecta, potentially indicative of minimal hydrogen mixing in a delayed-detonation explosion scenario. Additionally, the Ni/Fe ratio derived from the nebular spectrum of SN 2024gy provides further support for this model.         |

|| X.-L. Fan, <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-08-05*|
|*Comments*| *10 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in A&A*|
|**Abstract**|            Context. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and star forming galaxies (SFGs) are the primary sources of extragalactic radio sky. But it is difficult to distinguish the radio emission produced by AGNs from that by SFGs, especially when the radio sources are faint. Best et al. (2023) classified the radio sources in LoTSS Deep Fields DR1 through multiwavelength SED fitting. With the classification results of them, we perform a supervised machine learning to distinguish radio AGNs and radio SFGs. Aims. We aim to provide a supervised classifier to identify radio AGNs, which can get both high purity and completeness simultaneously, and can easily be applied to datasets of large-area surveys. Methods. The classifications of Best et al. (2023) are used as the true labels for supervised machine learning. With the cross-matched sample of LoTSS Deep Fields DR1, AllWISE and Gaia DR3, the features of optical and mid-infrared magnitude and colors, are applied to train the classifier. The performance of the classifier is evaluated mainly by the precission, recall and F1 score of both AGNs and non-AGNs. Results. By comparing the performance of six learning algorithms, CatBoost is chosen to construct the best classifier. The best classifier get precision = 0.974, recall = 0.865 and F1 = 0.916 for AGNs, precision = 0.936, recall = 0.988 and F1 = 0.961 for non-AGNs. After applying our classifier to the cross-matched sample of LoTSS DR2, AllWISE and Gaia DR3, we obtain a sample of 49716 AGNs and 102261 non-AGNs. The reliability of these classification results is confirmed by comparing with the spectroscopic classification of SDSS. The precission and recall of AGN sample can be as high as 94.2% and 92.3%, respectively. We also train a model to identify radio excess sources. The F1 scores are 0.610 and 0.965 for sources with and without radio excess, respectively.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2025-08-05*|

|**Abstract**|            Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with large perihelion distances ($q > 60$ au) and semi-major axes ($a > 200$ au) provide insights into the early evolution of the solar system and the existence of a hypothetical distant planet. These objects are still rare and their detection is challenging, yet they play a crucial role in constraining models of solar system formation. Here we report the discovery of a Sedna-like TNO, 2023\,KQ$_{14}$, nicknamed `Ammonite', with $q = 66$ au, $a = 252$ au, and inclination $i=11^\circ$. Ammonite's orbit does not align with those of the other Sedna-like objects and fills the previously unexplained `$q$-gap' in the observed distribution of distant solar system objects. Simulations demonstrate that Ammonite is dynamically stable over 4.5 billion years. % with less than 1\% variation in its semi-major axis. Our analysis suggests that Ammonite and the other Sedna-like objects may have shared a primordial orbital clustering around 4.2 billion years ago. Furthermore, Ammonite's stable orbit favors larger orbits ($\sim$ 500 au) rather than closer ones for a large hypothetical planet in present-day trans-Neptunian space.         |
