|**Abstract**|            The newly accessible mid-infrared (MIR) window offered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for exoplanet imaging is expected to provide valuable information to characterize their atmospheres. In particular, coronagraphs on board the JWST Mid-InfraRed instrument (MIRI) are capable of imaging the coldest directly imaged giant planets at the wavelengths where they emit most of their flux. The MIRI coronagraphs have been specially designed to detect the NH3 absorption around 10.5 microns, which has been predicted by atmospheric models. We aim to assess the presence of NH3 while refining the atmospheric parameters of one of the coldest companions detected by directly imaging GJ 504 b. Its mass is still a matter of debate and depending on the host star age estimate, the companion could either be placed in the brown dwarf regime or in the young Jovian planet regime. We present an analysis of MIRI coronagraphic observations of the GJ 504 system. We took advantage of previous observations of reference stars to build a library of images and to perform a more efficient subtraction of the stellar diffraction pattern. We detected the presence of NH3 at 12.5 sigma in the atmosphere, in line with atmospheric model expectations for a planetary-mass object and observed in brown dwarfs within a similar temperature range. The best-fit model with Exo-REM provides updated values of its atmospheric parameters, yielding a temperature of Teff = 512 K and radius of R = 1.08 RJup. These observations demonstrate the capability of MIRI coronagraphs to detect NH3 and to provide the first MIR observations of one of the coldest directly imaged companions. Overall, NH3 is a key molecule for characterizing the atmospheres of cold planets, offering valuable insights into their surface gravity. These observations provide valuable information for spectroscopic observations planned with JWST.         |

|**Abstract**|            Both particle physics experiments and cosmological observations have been used to explore neutrino properties. Cosmological researches of neutrinos often rely on the early-universe cosmic microwave background observations or other late-universe probes, which mostly focus on large-scale structures. We introduce a distinct probe, the 21-cm forest, that differs from other probes in both time and scale. Actually, the 21-cm forest is a unique tool for studying small-scale structures in the early universe. Below the free-streaming scale, massive neutrinos suppress the matter power spectrum, influencing small-scale fluctuations in the distribution of matter. The one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest can track these fluctuations across different scales, similar to the matter power spectrum, providing an effective method to probe neutrino mass. Although heating effects in the early universe can also impact the 1D power spectrum of the 21-cm forest, we assess the potential of the 21-cm forest as a tool for measuring neutrino mass, given that the temperature of the intergalactic medium can be constrained using other methods within a certain range. We also discuss the impact of cosmological parameters on our results. In the ideal scenario, the 21-cm forest observation will have the ability to constrain the total neutrino mass to around 0.1 eV. With the accumulation of observational data and advancements in observational technology, the 21-cm forest holds great promise as an emerging and potent tool for measuring neutrino mass.         |

|| H. Liu, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            The in-flight calibration and performance of the Solar Disk Imager (SDI), which is a pivotal instrument of the Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope (LST) onboard the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) mission, suggested a much lower spatial resolution than expected. In this paper, we developed the SDI point-spread function (PSF) and Image Bivariate Optimization Algorithm (SPIBOA) to improve the quality of SDI images. The bivariate optimization method smartly combines deep learning with optical system modeling. Despite the lack of information about the real image taken by SDI and the optical system function, this algorithm effectively estimates the PSF of the SDI imaging system directly from a large sample of observational data. We use the estimated PSF to conduct deconvolution correction to observed SDI images, and the resulting images show that the spatial resolution after correction has increased by a factor of more than three with respect to the observed ones. Meanwhile, our method also significantly reduces the inherent noise in the observed SDI images. The SPIBOA has now been successfully integrated into the routine SDI data processing, providing important support for the scientific studies based on the data. The development and application of SPIBOA also pave new ways to identify astronomical telescope systems and enhance observational image quality. Some essential factors and precautions in applying the SPIBOA method are also discussed.         |
