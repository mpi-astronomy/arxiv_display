|**Abstract**|            We present results from an experimental study on the interaction of atomic deuterium with Mg-rich amorphous enstatite and forsterite type silicates. Infrared spectroscopy was used to examine the process. During D atom exposure, deuteroxyl group formation was observed. The cross section for OD group formation, estimated from the OD stretching band intensity with D atom fluence, is 4.2.10^{-18} cm^2 for both silicates. HD (D2) molecules form via D atom abstraction of chemisorbed H(D) atoms from OH (OD) groups, with a cross section of 7.0.10^{-18} cm^2. Quantum chemical calculations on enstatite and forsterite amorphous nano-clusters were used to analyze chemisorption and abstraction energies of H atoms. The formation of OH groups on forsterite is barrierless, while enstatite has a small energy barrier. H2 abstraction from hydroxyl groups is barrierless in both silicates. The results support our interpretation of IR spectral changes during D atom exposure as addition and exchange reactions, with catalytic molecular deuterium formation. These findings, obtained at 300 K, are relevant to astrophysical environments like photodissociation regions and interstellar clouds at lower temperatures. Amorphous silicates, like carbon grains, undergo hydrogenation in the diffuse interstellar medium due to interactions with atomic hydrogen and UV photons. The detection of these components on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko connects primitive solar system objects to interstellar dust, offering new insights into their evolution.         |

|**Abstract**|            The two giant protoplanets directly imaged in the dust-depleted cavity of PDS 70 offer a unique opportunity to study ongoing planet formation. Both planets have been detected in infrared thermal emission and in H$\alpha$, indicating active accretion. We calibrate and analyse archival ALMA Band 6 and 7 observations of PDS 70 from 2019, 2021, and 2023 to search for circumplanetary material and assess its motion. Using 2D visibility modelling of the high-resolution (~0.11"x0.08" in Band 6; ~0.05"x0.05" in Band 7) dust continuum from the outer disc, we subtract the model and image the cavity at multiple epochs. We re-detect compact dust emission around PDS 70 c in all datasets with >$3.8\sigma$ significance, and tentatively detect emission near PDS 70 b at ~$3\sigma$ in Band 6, with peak fluxes of $59\pm17\mu$Jy/beam and $46\pm14\mu$Jy/beam. The relative astrometry of the compact emission around PDS 70 c is consistent with the expected position of the planet between 2019-2023. We find a peak flux difference up to $64\pm34\mu$Jy/beam at 1$\sigma$, but Bayesian analysis indicates no significant variability. We detect no flux variability in the inner disc. The inferred dust mass near PDS 70 c and in the inner disc ranges from $0.008$-$0.063 M_\oplus$ and $0.04$-$0.31 M_\oplus$, respectively, consistent with prior estimates. Finally, we measure Band 6-7 spectral indices of $2.5\pm1.2$ (PDS 70 c) and $3.2\pm0.5$ (inner disc), suggesting that the inner disc emission is dominated by optically thin dust.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the Local Group L-Band Survey (LGLBS), a Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) survey producing the highest quality 21-cm and 1-2 GHz radio continuum images to date for the six VLA-accessible, star-forming, Local Group galaxies. Leveraging the VLA's spectral multiplexing power, we simultaneously survey the 21-cm line at high 0.4 km/s velocity resolution, the 1-2 GHz polarized continuum, and four OH lines. For the massive spiral M31, the dwarf spiral M33, and the dwarf irregular galaxies NGC6822, IC10, IC1613, and the Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte Galaxy (WLM), we use all four VLA configurations and the Green Bank Telescope to reach angular resolutions of $< 5''$ ($10{-}20$~pc) for the 21-cm line with $<10^{20}$~cm$^{-2}$ column density sensitivity, and even sharper views ($< 2''$; $5{-}10$~pc) of the continuum. Targeting these nearby galaxies ($D\lesssim1$ Mpc) reveals a sharp, resolved view of the atomic gas, including 21-cm absorption, and continuum emission from supernova remnants and HII regions. These datasets can be used to test theories of the abundance and formation of cold clouds, the driving and dissipation of interstellar turbulence, and the impact of feedback from massive stars and supernovae. Here, we describe the survey design and execution, scientific motivation, data processing, and quality assurance. We provide a first look at and publicly release the wide-field 21-cm HI data products for M31, M33, and four dwarf irregular targets in the survey, which represent some of the highest physical resolution 21-cm observations of any external galaxies beyond the LMC and SMC.         |

|**Abstract**|            The energy spectrum of cosmic rays above 2.5 EeV has been measured across the declination range $-90^\circ \leq\delta\leq +44.8^\circ$ using data from $\sim 310{,}000$ events accrued at the Pierre Auger Observatory from an exposure of $(104{,}900\pm 3{,}100)$ km$^2\,$sr$\,$yr. No significant variations of energy spectra with declination are observed, after allowing or not for non-uniformities across the sky arising from the well-established dipolar anisotropies in the arrival directions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. Additionally, the instep feature in the spectrum at $\simeq$ 10 EeV reported previously is now established at a significance above $5\,\sigma$. The quasi-uniformity of the energy spectrum across declinations disfavors an origin for the instep from a few distinctive sources.         |

|**Abstract**|            Precise localizations of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are essential for uncovering their host galaxies and immediate environments. We present the milliarcsecond-precision European VLBI Network (EVN) localization of FRB 20240114A, a hyper-active repeating FRB, achieving <90x30 mas (1-sigma) accuracy. This precision places the burst 0.5 kpc from the nucleus of its low-metallicity star-forming dwarf host at a spectroscopic redshift of z = 0.1300. Our Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC) spectroscopic follow-up reveals that the dwarf FRB host is gravitationally bound to a more massive, star-forming spiral galaxy. This establishes the first known instance of an FRB residing in a satellite galaxy within a larger galactic system. This configuration, analogous to the Small Magellanic Cloud orbiting the Milky Way (but at a lower overall mass scale), expands the known diversity of FRB host environments and offers important insights for interpreting seemingly "hostless" or highly offset FRBs. Furthermore, our detailed dispersion measure (DM) budget analysis indicates that the dominant contribution to FRB 20240114A's DM likely originates from the foreground halo of the central galaxy. This finding addresses the anomalously high DM observed for this FRB and underscores the significant role of intervening foreground structures in shaping observed FRB DMs, which is important for accurate FRB-based cosmological measurements. Our results highlight the importance of deep, high-resolution optical/infrared observations (e.g., with Hubble or James Webb Space Telescopes) to fully leverage our precise radio localization and probe the immediate astrophysical birthplaces of FRB progenitors within these complex galactic systems.         |
