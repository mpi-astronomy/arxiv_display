|**Abstract**| Interstellar ices are largely composed of frozen water. It is important to derive fundamental parameters for H$_2$O ice such as absorption and scattering opacities for which accurate complex refractive indexes are needed. The primary goal of this work is to derive ice-grain opacities based on accurate H$_2$O ice complex refractive indexes and to assess their impact on the derivation of ice column densities and porosity in space. We use the \texttt{optool} code to derive ice-grain opacities values based on new mid-IR complex refractive index measurements of H$_2$O ice. Next, we use those opacities in the \texttt{RADMC-3D} code to run a radiative transfer simulation of a protostellar envelope containing H$_2$O ice. This is used to calculate water ice column densities. We find that the real refractive index in the mid-IR of H$_2$O ice at 30~K is $\sim$14\% lower than previously reported in the literature. This has a direct impact on the ice column densities derived from the simulations of embedded protostars. We find that ice porosity plays a significant role in the opacity of icy grains and that the H$_2$O libration mode can be used as a diagnostic tool to constrain the porosity level. Finally, the refractive indexes presented here allow us to estimate a grain size detection limit of 18~$\mu$m based on the 3~$\mu$m band whereas the 6~$\mu$m band allows tracing grain sizes larger than 20~$\mu$m. Based on radiative transfer simulations using new mid-IR refractive indexes, we conclude that H$_2$O ice leads to more absorption of infrared light than previously estimated. This implies that the 3 and 6~$\mu$m bands remain detectable in icy grains with sizes larger than 10~$\mu$m. Finally, we propose that also the H$_2$O ice libration band can be a diagnostic tool to constrain the porosity level of the interstellar ice, in addition to the OH dangling bond, which is routinely used for this purpose. |

|**Abstract**| In this letter, we report the discovery of the highest redshift, heavily obscured, radio-loud QSO candidate selected using JWST NIRCam/MIRI, mid-IR, sub-mm, and radio imaging in the COSMOS-Web field. Using multi-frequency radio observations and mid-IR photometry, we identify a powerful, radio-loud (RL), growing supermassive black hole (SMBH) with significant spectral steepening of the radio SED ($f_{1.32 \mathrm{GHz}} \sim 2$ mJy, $q_{24\mu m} = -1.1$, $\alpha_{1.32-3\mathrm{GHz}}=-1.2$, $\Delta \alpha = -0.4$). In conjunction with ALMA, deep ground-based observations, ancillary space-based data, and the unprecedented resolution and sensitivity of JWST, we find no evidence of QSO contribution to the UV/optical/NIR data and thus infer heavy amounts of obscuration (N$_{\mathrm{H}} > 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$). Using the wealth of deep UV to sub-mm photometric data, we report a singular solution photo-z of $z_\mathrm{phot}$ = 7.65$^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ and estimate an extremely massive host-galaxy ($\log M_{\star} = 11.92 \pm 0.06\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$). This source represents the furthest known obscured RL QSO candidate, and its level of obscuration aligns with the most representative but observationally scarce population of QSOs at these epochs. |
