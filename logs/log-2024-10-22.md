|**Abstract**|            In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the IRS 17 filament within the intermediate-mass protocluster IRAS 08448-4343 (of $\sim\,10^3\,\rm M_{\odot}$), using ALMA data from the ATOMS 3-mm and QUARKS 1.3-mm surveys. The IRS 17 filament, which spans $\sim$54000 au ($0.26\,\rm pc$) in length and $\sim$4000 au ($0.02\,\rm pc$) in width, exhibits a complex, multi-component velocity field, and harbours hierarchical substructures. These substructures include three bundles of seven velocity-coherent fibers, and 29 dense ($n\sim 10^8\,\rm cm^{-3}$) condensations. The fibers have a median length of $\sim 4500\,\rm au$ and a median width of $\sim 1400\,\rm au$. Among these fibers, four are identified as ``fertile", each hosting at least three dense condensations, which are regarded as the ``seeds" of star formation. While the detected cores are randomly spaced within the IRS\,17 filament based on the 3-mm dust continuum image, periodic spacing ($\sim1600\,\rm au$) of condensations is observed in the fertile fibers according to the 1.3-mm dust map, consistent with the predictions of linear isothermal cylinder fragmentation models. These findings underscore the crucial role of fibers in star formation and suggest a hierarchical fragmentation process that extends from the filament to the fibers, and ultimately, to the smallest-scale condensations.         |

|| W. M. Baker, et al. -- incl., <mark>A. d. Graaff</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            We use NIRSpec/MSA spectroscopy and NIRCam imaging to study a sample of 18 massive ($\log\; M_{*}/M_{\odot} \gt 10\;$dex), central quiescent galaxies at $2\leq z \leq 5$ in the GOODS fields, to investigate their number density, star-formation histories, quenching timescales, and incidence of AGN. The depth of our data reaches $\log M_*/M_\odot \approx 9\;$dex, yet the least-massive central quiescent galaxy found has $\log M_*/M_\odot \gt 10\;$dex, suggesting that quenching is regulated by a physical quantity that scales with $M_*$. With spectroscopy as benchmark, we assess the completeness and purity of photometric samples, finding number densities 10 times higher than predicted by galaxy formation models, confirming earlier photometric studies. We compare our number densities to predictions from FLAMINGO, the largest-box full-hydro simulation suite to date. We rule out cosmic variance at the 3-$\sigma$ level, providing spectroscopic confirmation that galaxy formation models do not match observations at $z>3$. Using FLAMINGO, we find that the vast majority of quiescent galaxies' stars formed in situ, with these galaxies not having undergone multiple major dry mergers. This is in agreement with the compact observed size of these systems and suggests that major mergers are not a viable channel for quenching most massive galaxies. Several of our observed galaxies are particularly old, with four galaxies displaying 4000-Ã… breaks; full-spectrum fitting infers formation and quenching redshifts of $z\geq8$ and $z\geq6$. Using all available AGN tracers, we find that 8 massive quiescent galaxies host AGN, including in old systems. This suggests a high duty cycle of AGN and a continued trickle of gas to fuel accretion.         |

|| Z. Liu, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Shi</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-10-22*|
|*Comments*| *13 pages, 12, figures, accepted by ApJS*|
|**Abstract**|            In this work, we update the catalog of OB stars based on the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) data release 7 and modified the OB stars selection criterion the spectral line indices space. The new catalog includes 37,778 spectra of 27,643 OB stars, of which 3827 OB stars are newly identified. The spectral subclasses of 27,643 OB stars are obtained using the automatic classification code MKCLASS. We find that the modified OB star selection criteria can better improve the completeness of late B-type stars by analyzing their spectral classification results given by MKCLASS. We also identify 3006 Be-type stars or candidates by examining the Balmer lines in their spectra and find that the frequency of our Be-type stars (10.9\%) is consistent with previous results. The spatial distribution of OB stars indicates that they are mainly located in the Galactic disk. This new catalog of OB stars will provide valuable data for studying the structure and evolution of the Milky Way.         |

|| Q.-L. Gu, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-10-22*|

|**Abstract**|            We present 850 {\mu}m thermal dust polarization observations with a resolution of 14.4"(~ 0.13 pc) towards an infrared dark cloud G16.96+0.27 using JCMT/POL-2. The average magnetic field orientation, which roughly agrees with the larger-scale magnetic field orientation traced by the Planck 353 GHz data, is approximately perpendicular to the filament structure. The estimated plane-of-sky magnetic field strength is ~ 96 {\mu}G and ~ 60 {\mu}G using two variants of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi methods. We calculate the virial and magnetic critical parameters to evaluate the relative importance of gravity, the magnetic field, and turbulence. The magnetic field and turbulence are both weaker than gravity, but magnetic fields and turbulence together are equal to gravity, suggesting that G16.96+0.27 is in a quasi-equilibrium state. The cloud-magnetic-field alignment is found to have a trend moving away from perpendicularity in the dense regions, which may serve as a tracer of potential fragmentation in such quiescent filaments.         |
