|**Abstract**| We present new HI observations of the nearby massive spiral galaxy M83, taken with the VLA at $21^{\prime\prime}$ angular resolution ($\approx500$ pc) of an extended ($\sim$1.5 deg$^2$) 10-point mosaic combined with GBT single dish data. We study the super-extended HI disk of M83 (${\sim}$50 kpc in radius), in particular disc kinematics, rotation and the turbulent nature of the atomic interstellar medium. We define distinct regions in the outer disk ($r_{\rm gal}>$central optical disk), including ring, southern area, and southern and northern arm. We examine HI gas surface density, velocity dispersion and non-circular motions in the outskirts, which we compare to the inner optical disk. We find an increase of velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$) towards the pronounced HI ring, indicative of more turbulent HI gas. Additionally, we report over a large galactocentric radius range (until $r_{\rm gal}{\sim}$50 kpc) that $\sigma_v$ is slightly larger than thermal (i.e. $>8$km s$^{-1}$ ). We find that a higher star formation rate (as traced by FUV emission) is not always necessarily associated with a higher HI velocity dispersion, suggesting that radial transport could be a dominant driver for the enhanced velocity dispersion. We further find a possible branch that connects the extended HI disk to the dwarf irregular galaxy UGCA365, that deviates from the general direction of the northern arm. Lastly, we compare mass flow rate profiles (based on 2D and 3D tilted ring models) and find evidence for outflowing gas at r$_{\rm gal}$ $\sim$2 kpc, inflowing gas at r$_{\rm gal}$ $\sim$5.5 kpc and outflowing gas at r$_{\rm gal}$ $\sim$14 kpc. We caution that mass flow rates are highly sensitive to the assumed kinematic disk parameters, in particular, to the inclination. |

|| <mark>P. Gaikwad</mark>, et al. -- incl., <mark>F. Nasir</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-04-06*|
|*Comments*| *30 pages (+14 pages appendices), 14 figures (+18 figures appendices); submitted to MNRAS; Main results are summarized in Fig. 10, Fig. 11 and Table 3*|
|**Abstract**| We measure the mean free path ($\lambda_{\rm mfp,HI}$), photo-ionization rate ($\langle \Gamma_{\rm HI} \rangle$) and neutral fraction ($\langle f_{\rm HI} \rangle$) of hydrogen in 12 redshift bins at $4.85<z<6.05$ from a large sample of moderate resolution XShooter and ESI QSO absorption spectra. The fluctuations in ionizing radiation field are modeled by post-processing simulations from the Sherwood suite using our new code ''EXtended reionization based on the Code for Ionization and Temperature Evolution'' (EX-CITE). EX-CITE uses efficient Octree summation for computing intergalactic medium attenuation and can generate large number of high resolution $\Gamma_{\rm HI}$ fluctuation models. Our simulation with EX-CITE shows remarkable agreement with simulations performed with the radiative transfer code Aton and can recover the simulated parameters within $1\sigma$ uncertainty. We measure the three parameters by forward-modeling the Ly$\alpha$ forest and comparing the effective optical depth ($\tau_{\rm eff, HI}$) distribution in simulations and observations. The final uncertainties in our measured parameters account for the uncertainties due to thermal parameters, modeling parameters, observational systematics and cosmic variance. Our best fit parameters show significant evolution with redshift such that $\lambda_{\rm mfp,HI}$ and $\langle f_{\rm HI} \rangle$ decreases and increases by a factor $\sim 6$ and $\sim 10^{4}$, respectively from $z \sim 5$ to $z \sim 6$. By comparing our $\lambda_{\rm mfp,HI}$, $\langle \Gamma_{\rm HI} \rangle$ and $\langle f_{\rm HI} \rangle$ evolution with that in state-of-the-art Aton radiative transfer simulations and the Thesan and CoDa-III simulations, we find that our best fit parameter evolution is consistent with a model in which reionization completes by $z \sim 5.2$. |

|| R. Brahm, et al. -- incl., <mark>T. Trifonov</mark>, <mark>J. Eberhardt</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-04-06*|

|**Abstract**| We report the discovery and orbital characterization of three new transiting warm giant planets. These systems were initially identified as presenting single transit events in the light curves generated from the full frame images of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Follow-up radial velocity measurements and additional light curves were used to determine the orbital periods and confirm the planetary nature of the candidates. The planets orbit slightly metal-rich late F- and early G-type stars. We find that TOI 4406b has a mass of $M_P$= 0.30 $\pm$ 0.04 $M_J$ , a radius of $R_P$= 1.00 $\pm$ 0.02 $R_J$ , and a low eccentricity orbit (e=0.15 $\pm$ 0.05) with a period of P= 30.08364 $\pm$ 0.00005 d . TOI 2338b has a mass of $M_P$= 5.98 $\pm$ 0.20 $M_J$ , a radius of $R_P$= 1.00 $\pm$ 0.01 $R_J$ , and a highly eccentric orbit (e= 0.676 $\pm$ 0.002 ) with a period of P= 22.65398 $\pm$ 0.00002 d . Finally, TOI 2589b has a mass of $M_P$= 3.50 $\pm$ 0.10 $M_J$ , a radius of $R_P$= 1.08 $\pm$ 0.03 $R_J$ , and an eccentric orbit (e = 0.522 $\pm$ 0.006 ) with a period of P= 61.6277 $\pm$ 0.0002 d . TOI 4406b and TOI 2338b are enriched in metals compared to their host stars, while the structure of TOI 2589b is consistent with having similar metal enrichment to its host star. |

|| C. Zhu, G. LÃ¼, X. Lu, <mark>J. He</mark> |

|**Abstract**| The binary systems consisting of a Be star and a white dwarf (BeWDs) are very interesting.They can originate from the binaries composed of a Be star and a subdwarf O or B star (BesdOBs), and they can merge into red giants via luminous red nova or can evolve into double WD potentially detected by $LISA$ mission. Using the method of population synthesis, we investigate the formation and the destiny of BeWDs,and discuss the effects of the metallicity ($Z$) and the common envelope evolution parameters. We find that BesdOBs are significant progenitors of BeWDs. About 30\% ($Z=0.0001$)-50\% ($Z=0.02$) of BeWDs come from BesdOBs. About 60\% ($Z=0.0001$) -70\% ($Z=0.02$) of BeWDs turn into red giants via a merger between a WD and a non-degenerated star. About 30\% ($Z=0.0001$) -40\% ($Z=0.02$) of BeWDs evolve into double WDs which are potential gravitational waves of $LISA$ mission at a frequency band between about $3\times10^{-3}$ and $3\times10^{-2}$ Hz. The common envelope evolution parameter introduces an uncertainty with a factor of about 1.3 on BeWD populations in our simulations. |
