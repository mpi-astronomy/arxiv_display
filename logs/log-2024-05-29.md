|**Abstract**|            [Abridged] In recent years, conflicting results have provided an uncertain view of the dust-attenuated properties of $z>4$ star-forming galaxies (SFGs). To solve this, we used the deepest data publicly available in COSMOS to build a mass-complete ($>10^{9.5}\,M_{\odot}$) sample of SFGs at $4<z<5$ and measured their dust-attenuated properties by stacking all archival ALMA band 6 and 7 observations available. Combining this information with their rest-frame ultraviolet emission from the COSMOS2020 catalog, we constrained the IRX ($\equiv L_{\rm IR}/L_{\rm UV}$)--$\beta_{\rm UV}$, IRX--$M_\ast$, and SFR--$M_\ast$ relations at $z\sim4.5$. Finally, using these relations and the stellar mass function of SFGs at $z\sim4.5$, we inferred the unattenuated and dust-attenuated SFRD at this epoch. SFGs at $z\sim4.5$ follow an IRX--$\beta_{\rm UV}$ relation that is consistent with that of local starbursts, while they follow a steeper IRX--$M_\ast$ relation than observed locally. The grain properties of dust in these SFGs seems thus similar to those in local starbursts but its mass and geometry result in lower attenuation in low-mass SFGs. SFGs at $z\sim4.5$ lie on a linear SFR--$M_\ast$ relation, whose normalization varies by 0.3 dex, when we exclude or include from our stacks the ALMA primary targets. The cosmic SFRD$(>M_\ast)$ converges at $M_\ast<10^{9}\,M_\odot$ and is dominated by SFGs with $M_\ast\sim10^{9.5-10.5}\,M_\odot$. The fraction of the cosmic SFRD that is attenuated by dust, ${\rm SFRD}_{\rm IR}(>M_\ast)/ {\rm SFRD}(>M_\ast)$, is $90\pm4\%$ for $M_\ast\,=\,10^{10}\,M_\odot$, $68\pm10\%$ for $M_\ast=10^{8.9}\,M_\odot$ (i.e., $0.03\times M^\star$; $M^\star$ being the characteristic stellar mass of SFGs) and this value converges to $60\pm10\%$ for $M_\ast=10^{8}\,M_\odot$. Even at this early epoch, the fraction of the cosmic SFRD that is attenuated by dust remains thus significant.         |

|**Abstract**|            We forecast the expected population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) observable in the Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) and Euclid Deep Survey (EDS). Starting from an X-ray luminosity function (XLF) we generate volume-limited samples of the AGN expected in the survey footprints. Each AGN is assigned an SED appropriate for its X-ray luminosity and redshift, with perturbations sampled from empirical distributions. The photometric detectability of each AGN is assessed via mock observation of the assigned SED. We estimate 40 million AGN will be detectable in at least one band in the EWS and 0.24 million in the EDS, corresponding to surface densities of 2.8$\times$10$^{3}$ deg$^{-2}$ and 4.7$\times$10$^{3}$ deg$^{-2}$. Employing colour selection criteria on our simulated data we select a sample of 4.8$\times$10$^{6}$ (331 deg$^{-2}$) AGN in the EWS and 1.7$\times$10$^{4}$ (346 deg$^{-2}$) in the EDS, amounting to 10% and 8% of the AGN detectable in the EWS and EDS. Including ancillary Rubin/LSST bands improves the completeness and purity of AGN selection. These data roughly double the total number of selected AGN to comprise 21% and 15% of the detectable AGN in the EWS and EDS. The total expected sample of colour-selected AGN contains 6.0$\times$10$^{6}$ (74%) unobscured AGN and 2.1$\times$10$^{6}$ (26%) obscured AGN, covering $0.02 \leq z \lesssim 5.2$ and $43 \leq \log_{10} (L_{bol} / erg s^{-1}) \leq 47$. With this simple colour selection, expected surface densities are already comparable to the yield of modern X-ray and mid-infrared surveys of similar area. The relative uncertainty on our expectation for detectable AGN is 6.7% for the EWS and 12.5% for the EDS, driven by the uncertainty of the XLF.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present optical follow-up of IGR J16194-2810, a hard X-ray source discovered by the INTEGRAL mission. The optical counterpart is a $\sim500\,L_\odot$ red giant at a distance of $2.1$ kpc. We measured 16 radial velocities (RVs) of the giant over a period of $\sim 300$ days. Fitting these RVs with a Keplerian model, we find an orbital period of $P_{\rm orb} = 192.73 \pm 0.01$ days and a companion mass function $f(M_2) = 0.361 \pm 0.005 \,M_{\odot}$. We detect ellipsoidal variability with the same period in optical light curves from the ASAS-SN survey. Joint fitting of the RVs, light curves, and the broadband SED allows us to robustly constrain the masses of both components. We find a giant mass of $M_\star = 1.02\pm 0.01\,M_{\odot}$ and a companion mass of $M_{2} = 1.35^{+0.09}_{-0.07}\,M_{\odot}$, implying that the companion is a neutron star (NS). We recover a $4.06$-hour period in the system's TESS light curve, which we tentatively associate with the NS spin period. The giant does not yet fill its Roche lobe, suggesting that current mass transfer is primarily via winds. MESA evolutionary models predict that the giant will overflow its Roche lobe in $5$-$10$ Myr, eventually forming a recycled pulsar + white dwarf binary with a $\sim 900$ day period. IGR J16194-2810 provides a window on the future evolution of wide NS + main sequence binaries recently discovered via Gaia astrometry. As with those systems, the binary's formation history is uncertain. Before the formation of the NS, it likely survived a common envelope episode with a donor-to-accretor mass ratio $\gtrsim 10$ and emerged in a wide orbit. The NS likely formed with a weak kick ($v_{\rm kick}\lesssim 100\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$), as stronger kicks would have disrupted the orbit.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the discovery of 8 isolated millisecond pulsars in Globular Cluster (GC) NGC 6517 using the Five-Hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The spin periods of those pulsars (namely PSR J1801-0857K to R, or, NGC 6517K to R) are all shorter than 10 ms. With these discoveries, NGC 6517 is currently the GC with the most known pulsars in the FAST sky. The largest difference in dispersion measure of the pulsars in NGC 6517 is 11.2 cm$^{-3}$ pc, the second among all GCs. The fraction of isolated pulsars in this GC (16 of 17, 94$\%$) is consistent with previous studies indicating an overabundance of isolated pulsars in the densest GCs, especially in those undergoing cluster core collapse. Considering the FAST GC pulsar discoveries, we modeled the GC pulsar population using the empirical Bayesian method described by Turk and Lorimer with the recent counts. Using this approach, we find that the expected number of potential pulsars in GCs seems to be correlated with the central escape velocity, hence, the GCs Liller 1, NGC 6441, M54 (NGC 6715), and $\omega$-Cen (NGC 5139) are expected to host the largest numbers of pulsars.         |
