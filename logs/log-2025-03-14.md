|**Abstract**|            The point-spread function of the integral-field unit (IFU) mode of the JWST's NIRSpec is heavily under-sampled, creating resampling noise seen as low-frequency sinusoidal-like artifacts, or "wiggles". These artifacts in the data are not corrected in the JWST data pipeline, and significantly impact the science that can be achieved at a single-pixel level. We present WICKED (WIggle Corrector Kit for NIRSpEc Data), a tool designed to empirically remove wiggles. WICKED uses the Fast Fourier Transform to identify wiggle-affected spaxels across the data cube. Spectra are modeled with a mix of integrated aperture and annular templates, a power-law, and a second-degree polynomial. The method works across all medium- and high-resolution NIRSpec gratings: F070LP, F100LP, F170LP, and F290LP. WICKED can recover the true overall spectral shape up to a factor of 3.5x better compared to uncorrected spectra. It recovers the equivalent width of absorption lines within 5% of the true value-~3x better than uncorrected spectra and ~2x better than other methods. WICKED significantly improves kinematic measurements, recovering the line-of-sight velocity (LOSV) within 1% of the true value -- more than 100x better than uncorrected spectra at S/N ~40. As a case study, we applied WICKED to G235H/F170LP IFU data of the elliptical galaxy NGC5128, finding good agreement with previous studies. In wiggle-affected regions, the uncorrected spectrum showed stellar LOSV and velocity dispersion differences compared to the WICKED-cleaned spectrum, of ~17x and ~36x larger than the estimated uncertainties, respectively. Wiggles in NIRSpec IFU data can introduce severe biases in spectral shape, line measurements, and kinematics to values larger than the typical uncertainties. WICKED provides a robust, user-friendly solution, enabling precise single-pixel studies and maximizing JWST's potential.         |

|**Abstract**|            The full range of conditions under which rocky planets can host atmospheres remains poorly understood, especially in the regime of close-in orbits around late-type stars. One way to assess the presence of atmospheres on rocky exoplanets is to measure their dayside emission as they are eclipsed by their host stars. Here, we present Spitzer observations of the 4.5 $\mu$m secondary eclipses of the rocky super-Earth TOI-431 b, whose mass and radius indicate an Earth-like bulk composition (3.07 $\pm$ 0.35 M$_{\oplus}$, 1.28 $\pm$ 0.04 R$_{\oplus}$). Exposed to more than 2000 times the irradiation of Earth, dayside temperatures of up to 2400K are expected if the planet is a dark bare-rock without a significant atmosphere. Intriguingly, despite the strong stellar insolation, we measure a secondary eclipse depth of only 33 $\pm$ 22 ppm, which corresponds to a dayside brightness temperature of $1520_{-390}^{+360}$K. This notably low eclipse depth disagrees with the dark bare-rock scenario at the 2.5$\sigma$ level, and suggests either that the planet is surrounded by an atmosphere, or that it is a bare-rock with a highly reflective surface. In the atmosphere scenario, the low dayside emission implies the efficient redistribution of heat to the nightside, or by molecular absorption in the 4-5 $\mu$m bandpass. In the bare-rock scenario, a surface composition made of a high-albedo mineral species such as ultramafic rock can lead to reduced thermal emission consistent with low eclipse depth measurement. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the James Webb Space Telescope hold the key to constraining the nature of the planet.         |

|**Abstract**|            Chemical abundance anomalies in twin stars have recently been considered tell-tale signs of interactions between stars and planets. While such signals are prevalent, their nature remains a subject of debate. On one hand, exoplanet formation may induce chemical depletion in host stars by locking up refractory elements. On the other hand, exoplanet engulfment can result in chemical enrichment, both processes potentially producing similar differential signals. In this study, we aim to observationally disentangle these processes by using the Ca II infrared triplet to measure the magnetic activity of 125 co-moving star pairs with high SNR, high-resolution spectra from the Magellan, Keck, and VLT telescopes. We find that co-natal star pairs in which the two stars exhibit significant chemical abundance differences also show differences in their magnetic activity, with stars depleted in refractories being magnetically more active. Furthermore, the strength of this correlation between differential chemical abundances and differential magnetic activity increases with condensation temperature. One possible explanation is that the chemical anomaly signature may be linked to planet formation, wherein refractory elements are locked into planets, and the host stars become more active due to more efficient contraction during the pre-main-sequence phase or star-planet tidal and magnetic interactions.         |

|**Abstract**|            We perform individual weak-lensing (WL) mass measurements for 78 eROSITA's first All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) clusters in the footprint of Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) S19A, without any priors of the eRASS1 X-ray quantities or assumption of the mass and concentration relation. In the sample, we find 3 clusters are mis-associated with optical counterparts and 12 clusters are poorly fitted with an NFW profile. The average mass for the 12 poor-fit clusters changes from $\sim 10^{14}h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$ to $\sim 2\times 10^{13}h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$ when lensing contamination from surrounding mass structures is taken into account. The scaling relations between the true mass and cluster richness and X-ray count-rate agree well with the results of the eRASS1 Western Galactic Hemisphere region based on count-rate-inferred masses, which are calibrated with the HSC-SSP, DES, and KiDS surveys. We develop a Bayesian framework for inferring the mass-concentration relation of the cluster sample, explicitly incorporating the effects of weak-lensing mass calibration in the mass-concentration parameter space. The redshift-dependent mass and concentration relation is in excellent agreement with predictions of dark-matter-only numerical simulations and previous studies using X-ray-selected clusters. Based on the two-dimensional (2D) WL analysis, the offsets between the WL-determined centers and the X-ray centroids for 36 eRASS1 clusters with high WL S/N are described by two Gaussian components. We find that the mis-centering effect with X-ray centroids is smaller than that with peaks in the galaxy maps. The projected halo ellipticity is $\langle \varepsilon \rangle=0.45$ at $M_{200}\sim 4\times10^{14}h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$, in agreement with results of numerical simulations and previous studies of clusters more than twice our mass.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of a new bright blue Einstein ring in the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) footprint: the Einstein ``blue eye''. Spectroscopic data from X-Shooter at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) show that the lens is a typical early-type galaxy (ETG) at $z=0.9906$, while the background source is a Ly$\alpha$ emitter at $z=2.823$. The reference lens modeling was performed on a high-resolution $Y-$band adaptive-optics image from HAWK-I at VLT. Assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) total mass density profile, we inferred an Einstein radius $R_{Ein}=10.47 \pm 0.06$ kpc. The average slope of the total mass density inside the Einstein radius, as determined by a joint analysis of lensing and isotropic Jeans equations is $\gamma=2.14^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$, showing no systematic deviation from the slopes of lower redshit galaxies, This can be the evidence of ETGs developing through dry mergers plus moderate dissipationless accretion. Stellar population analysis with 8-band ($gri$ZYJHK$s$) photometries from KiDS and VIKING shows that the total stellar mass of the lens is $M*=(3.95\pm 0.35)\times 10^{11} M_\odot$ (Salpeter Initial Mass Function, IMF), implying a dark matter fraction inside the effective radius to be $f_{\rm DM}=0.307\pm 0.151$. We finally explored the dark matter halo slope and found a strong degeneracy with the dynamic stellar mass. Dark matter adiabatic contraction is needed to explain the posterior distribution of the slope, unless IMF heavier than Salpeter is assumed.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Hubble tension has emerged as a critical crisis in cosmology, with the cause remaining unclear. Determining the Hubble constant ($H_0$) independently of cosmological models and distance ladders will help resolve this crisis. In this letter, we for the first time use 47 gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog to calibrate distances in the strong lensing system, RXJ1131-1231, and constrain $H_0$ through the distance-sum rule, with minimal cosmological assumptions. We assume that light propagation over long distances is described by the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric and that geometrical optics holds, but we do not need to assume the universe's contents or the theory of gravity on cosmological scales. Fixing $\Omega_K=0$, we obtain $H_0=73.22^{+5.95}_{-5.43}$ ${\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $H_0=70.40^{+8.03}_{-5.60}$ ${\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ by using the deflector galaxy's mass model and kinematic measurements to break mass-sheet transform, respectively. When $\Omega_K$ is not fixed, the central value of $H_0$ increases further. We find that our results are still dominated by statistical errors, and at the same time, we notice the great potential of using GW dark sirens to provide calibration, owing to their higher redshifts. When using 42 binary black holes and RXJ1131-1231, we obtain a $8.46 \%$ $H_0$ constraint precision, which is better than that from the bright siren GW170817 using the Hubble law by about $40\%$. In the future, as the redshift range of GW dark sirens increases, more and more SGLTDs can be included, and we can achieve high-precision, model-independent measurements of $H_0$ without the need for GW bright sirens.         |

|**Abstract**|            Sterile neutrinos can influence the evolution of the universe, and thus cosmological observations can be used to search for sterile neutrinos. In this study, we utilized the latest baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI, combined with the cosmic microwave background data from Planck and the five-year supernova data from DES, to constrain the interacting dark energy (IDE) models involving both cases of massless and massive sterile neutrinos. We consider four typical forms of the interaction term $Q=\beta H \rho_{\rm de}$, $Q=\beta H \rho_{\rm c}$, $Q=\beta H_{0} \rho_{\rm de}$, and $Q=\beta H_{0} \rho_{\rm c}$, respectively. Our analysis indicates that the current data provide only a hint of the existence of massless sterile neutrinos (as dark radiation) at about the $1\sigma$ level. In contrast, no evidence supports the existence of massive sterile neutrinos. Furthermore, in IDE models, the inclusion of (massless/massive) sterile neutrinos has a negligible impact on the constraint of the coupling parameter $\beta$. The IDE model of $Q=\beta H \rho_{\rm c}$ with sterile neutrinos does not favor an interaction. However, the other three IDE models with sterile neutrinos support an interaction in which dark energy decays into dark matter.         |

|**Abstract**|            In this study, we present a detailed analysis of public archival soft X-ray data on the classical nova V339 Delphini (Nova Del 2013) during its outburst, obtained using the {\it Chandra} High-Resolution Camera Spectrometer (HRC-S) and Low Energy Transmission Grating (LETG), as well as {\it XMM-Newton} in 2013. The observations, spanning from day 85.2 to day 112.0 after the optical maximum, capture the nova during its luminous supersoft X-ray source (SSS) phase. The spectra reveal numerous absorption features with blue-shifted velocities ranging from $\sim$ 724 to $\sim$ 1474 km s$^{-1}$, with the majority of lines blue-shifted by approximately 1200 km s$^{-1}$. We confirm the presence of a short-period modulation of the X-ray flux with a period of approximately 54 seconds, as well as the drift of this period, which was detected on days 97.0 and 112.0 during the outburst with both {\it XMM-Newton} and {\it Chandra}. This period modulation is transient in nature, with significant variations in amplitude and pulse profile over timescales of a few thousand seconds, likely due to temporary obscuration events that affect the emission from the central hot source. The pulse profiles exhibit substantial deviations from a pure sinusoidal shape, which may be related to the period drift. Additionally, the modulation amplitude shows a possible anti-correlation with the count rates on day 97.0, likely also caused by temporary obscuration events influencing the central source's emission.         |
