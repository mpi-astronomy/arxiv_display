|**Abstract**|            Unveiling the physical structure of protoplanetary disk is crucial for interpreting the diversity of the exoplanet population. Until recently, the census of the physical properties of protoplanetary disks probed by mid-infrared observations was limited to the solar neighborhood ($d \lesssim 250$ pc); however, nearby star-forming regions (SFRs) such as Taurus -- where no O-type stars reside -- are not representative of the environments where the majority of the planet formation occurs in the Galaxy. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now enables observations of disks in distant high-mass SFRs, where strong external Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) radiation is expected to impact those disks. Nevertheless, a detailed characterization of externally irradiated disks is still lacking. We use the thermochemical code ProDiMo to model JWST/MIRI spectroscopy and archival visual/near-infrared photometry aiming to constrain the physical structure of the irradiated disk around the solar-mass star XUE 1 in NGC 6357 ($d \approx 1690$ pc). Our findings are: (1) Mid-infrared dust emission features are explained by amorphous and crystalline silicates with compositions similar to nearby disks. (2) The molecular features detected with MIRI originate within the first $\sim 1$ au, consistent with slab models' results. (3) Our model favors a disk truncated at $10$ au with a gas-to-dust ratio of unity in the outskirts. (4) Comparing models of the same disk structure under different irradiation levels, we find that strong external irradiation raises gas temperature tenfold and boosts water abundance beyond $10$ au by a factor of $100$. Our findings suggest the inner disk resists external irradiation, retaining the elements necessary for planet formation.         |

|**Abstract**|            Fast radio bursts (FRBs), typically highly polarized, usually have a nearly constant polarization position angle (PA) during each burst. Some bursts show significant PA variations, and one of them was claimed to have a PA variation pattern consistent with the prediction of the rotating vector model (RVM) commonly adopted to fit the PA variations in radio pulsars. We systematically study the PA evolution pattern of 1727 bursts from three active repeating FRB sources monitored by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). We identify 46 bursts whose PA variations are fully consistent with the RVM. However, the inferred geometrical parameters and rotation periods derived from these RVM fitting are inconsistent from each other. This suggests that the magnetosphere of the FRB central engine is constantly distorted by the FRB emitter, and the magnetic configuration is dynamically evolving.         |

|| <mark>J. Liu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-04-02*|
|*Comments*| *9 pages, 8 figs, to appear on ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            Cen X-3 is an archetypical X-ray pulsar with strong flux variations and alternating torque reversals, both of which are similar to those of recently discovered pulsating ultra-luminous X-ray sources. We study a low state of Cen X-3 occurred in 2023 lasting for $\sim100$ days with Chandra and Insight-HXMT observations, supplemented with MAXI and Fermi/GBM data. The Chandra spectrum during the eclipse of Cen X-3 in the low state is very similar to that in the high state, especially, the Fe lines. The HXMT spectrum in the low state shows an enhanced Fe line, so do the MAXI data. The spin-up/spin-down trends of Cen X-3 are not affected by the low states. All these results indicate that the intrinsic emission in the low states is high, and the low states are just apparently low and are dominated by reprocessed emission. We found that the spin-up to spin-down reversals of Cen X-3 take longer time than the spin-down to spin-up reversals, which provides a definite observation test of any possible torque-reversal models. We discuss insights of these results for understanding the pulsating ultra-luminous X-ray sources.         |

|| S. Yan, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            The standard paradigm of cosmology assumes two distinct dark components, namely the dark energy driving the late-universe acceleration and the dark matter that is responsible for the structure formation. However, the necessity of splitting the dark-side world into two sectors has not been experimentally or theoretically proven. It is shown in Wang et al. 2024 that cosmology with one unified dark fluid can also explain the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and late-universe data, with the fitting quality not much worse than the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The present work aims to provide a clearer physical interpretation of the Wang et al. 2024 results. We show that the unified dark fluid model can produce primary CMB temperature and polarization power spectra that are very close to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction (relative difference $\lesssim 10^{-4}$). The model can also mimic the $\Lambda$CDM background expansion history and linear growth factor on sub-horizon scales with percent-level accuracy. With better physical understanding of the model, we make precision tests and find a minor error in the Boltzmann code used in Wang et al. 2024. We correct the error and update the model comparison between $\Lambda$CDM and the unified dark fluid model.         |
