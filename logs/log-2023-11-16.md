|**Abstract**| We explore the potential of using the low-redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest surrounding luminous red galaxies (LRGs) as a tool to constrain active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback models. Our analysis is based on snapshots from the Illustris and IllustrisTNG simulations at a redshift of $z=0.1$. These simulations offer an ideal platform for studying the influence of AGN feedback on the gas surrounding galaxies, as they share the same initial conditions and underlying code but incorporate different feedback prescriptions. Both simulations show significant impacts of feedback on the temperature and density of the gas around massive halos. Following our previous work, we adjusted the UV background in both simulations to align with the observed number density of Ly$\alpha$ lines ($\rm dN/dz$) in the intergalactic medium and study the Ly$\alpha$ forest around massive halos hosting LRGs, at impact parameters ($r_{\perp}$) ranging from 0.1 to 100 pMpc. Our findings reveal that $\rm dN/dz$, as a function of $r_{\perp}$, is approximately 1.5 to 2 times higher in IllustrisTNG compared to Illustris up to $r_{\perp}$ of $\sim 10$ pMpc. To further assess whether existing data can effectively discern these differences, we search for archival data containing spectra of background quasars probing foreground LRGs. Through a feasibility analysis based on this data, we demonstrate that ${\rm dN/dz} (r_{\perp})$ measurements can distinguish between feedback models of IllustrisTNG and Illustris with a precision exceeding 12$\sigma$. This underscores the potential of ${\rm dN/dz} (r_{\perp})$ measurements around LRGs as a valuable benchmark observation for discriminating between different feedback models. |

|**Abstract**| This paper presents an overview of the QUARKS survey, which stands for `Querying Underlying mechanisms of massive star formation with ALMA-Resolved gas Kinematics and Structures'. The QUARKS survey is observing 139 massive clumps covered by 156 pointings at ALMA Band 6 ($\lambda\sim$ 1.3 mm). In conjunction with data obtained from the ALMA-ATOMS survey at Band 3 ($\lambda\sim$ 3 mm), QUARKS aims to carry out an unbiased statistical investigation of massive star formation process within protoclusters down to a scale of 1000 au. This overview paper describes the observations and data reduction of the QUARKS survey, and gives a first look at an exemplar source, the mini-starburst Sgr B2(M). The wide-bandwidth (7.5 GHz) and high-angular-resolution (~0.3 arcsec) observations of the QUARKS survey allow to resolve much more compact cores than could be done by the ATOMS survey, and to detect previously unrevealed fainter filamentary structures. The spectral windows cover transitions of species including CO, SO, N$_2$D$^+$, SiO, H$_{30}\alpha$, H$_2$CO, CH$_3$CN and many other complex organic molecules, tracing gas components with different temperatures and spatial extents. QUARKS aims to deepen our understanding of several scientific topics of massive star formation, such as the mass transport within protoclusters by (hub-)filamentary structures, the existence of massive starless cores, the physical and chemical properties of dense cores within protoclusters, and the feedback from already formed high-mass young protostars. |

|**Abstract**| Jets powered by AGN in the early Universe ($z \gtrsim 6$) have the potential to not only define the trajectories of the first-forming massive galaxies but to enable the accelerated growth of their associated SMBHs. Under typical assumptions, jets could even rectify observed quasars with light seed formation scenarios; however, not only are constraints on the parameters of the first jets lacking, observations of these objects are scarce. Owing to the significant energy density of the CMB at these epochs capable of quenching radio emission, observations will require powerful, high angular resolution X-ray imaging to map and characterize these jets. As such, \textit{AXIS} will be necessary to understand early SMBH growth and feedback. |
