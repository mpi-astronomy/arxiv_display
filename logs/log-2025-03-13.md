|**Abstract**|            Some optically selected quasars exhibit Mg II assoicated absorption lines (AALs), and its origin remains unclear. In this paper, we compile a sample of 1769 quasars, with or without Mg II AALs. Of which 1689 are Far-Infrared (FIR) detected quasars and the rest are not detected in FIR. For the FIR undetected quasars, we obtain stacks for both with and without Mg II AAL quasars. Then we estimate the star formation rates (SFRs) within quasar host galaxies based on their FIR luminosities derived from their FIR greybody components, and find that, although quasars with Mg II AALs have significantly redder median composite spectra than those without Mg II AALs, the SFR distributions of the two types of quasars are statistically indistinguishable. These results do not require an evolutionary link between the quasars with and without Mg II AALs, and would be reconciled if an orientation effect cannot be ignored among the quasars hosting different types of absorption lines.         |

|**Abstract**|            We describe a practical implementation of the anamorphically curved detector concept. In order to demonstrate its advantages, a telescope lab prototype was developed, built, and tested. It is based on a 4-mirror all-spherical unobscured design, similar to that proposed by D. Shafer. The telescope is open at F/#=5.5 and its extended field of view is 10.6x8 degrees. We explore the design parameter space to demonstrate the change in gain introduced by the curved detector and to substantiate the chosen parameters. If the image surface is curved to the shape of a toroid, the image quality reaches the diffraction limit over the entire field by design. The design was optimized to use standard concave spherical mirrors. The detector was curved down toroidally with an exquisite surface precision of approximately 11 micrometers Peak-to-Valley. The experimental tests of the prototype have shown that use of the toroidally curved detector allows to increase the contrast in the field corner by up to 0.3 units, which is in good agreement with the modeling results. We also propose a few prospective applications of the demonstrated concept.         |
