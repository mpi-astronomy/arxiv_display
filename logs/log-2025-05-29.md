|**Abstract**|            About half of the mass of all heavy elements with mass number A > 90 is formed through the slow neutron capture process (s-process), occurring in evolved asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with masses ~1-6 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$. The s-process can be studied by modeling the accretion of material from AGB stars onto binary barium (Ba), CH, and carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP)-s stars. Comparing observationally derived surface parameters and 1D-LTE abundance patterns of s-process elements to theoretical binary accretion models, we aim to understand the formation of post-accretion systems. We explore the extent of dilution of the accreted material and describe the impact of convective mixing on the observed surface abundances. We compute a new grid of 2700 accretion models for low-mass post-accretion systems. A maximum-likelihood comparison determines the best fit models for observational samples of Ba, CH, and CEMP-s stars. We find consistent AGB donor masses in the mass range of 2-3 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ across our sample of post-accretion binaries. We find the formation scenario for weak Ba stars is an AGB star transferring a moderate amount of mass ($\leq$0.5 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$) resulting in a ~2.0-2.5 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ star. The strong Ba stars are best fit with lower final masses ~1.0-2.0 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$, and significant accreted mass ($\geq$0.5 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$). The CH and CEMP-s stars display lower final masses (~1.0 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$) and small amounts of transferred material (~0.1 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$). We find that Ba stars generally accrete more material than CEMP-s and CH stars. We also find that strong Ba stars must accrete more than 0.50 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ to explain their abundance patterns, and in this limit we are unable to reproduce the observed mass distribution of strong Ba stars. The mass distributions of the weak Ba stars, CEMP-s, and CH stars are well reproduced in our modeling.         |

|**Abstract**|            Absorption outflows in quasars play an important role in understanding active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback and their influence on galaxy evolution. The unprecedented spectral data provided by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) opens new avenues to explore these outflows. We analyze five low-ionization absorption outflow systems in four intermediate-redshift quasars (2 < z < 3) using the data obtained by DESI in order to characterize their physical properties and energetics, and also to assess their role in AGN feedback. We use the spectra from DESI's Early Data Release to determine the ionic column densities, total hydrogen column densities, electron number densities, and ionization parameters via photoionization modeling and absorption line analysis. We derive the outflows' distance from the AGN, and its kinematic properties: mass-flow rates, kinetic luminosity, and momentum flux. Our study identifies five distinct mini-broad absorption line outflow systems, hosted by four quasars. The identified outflows exhibit hydrogen column densities of \log (N_H) = 20.0-20.7[cm^{-2}], ionization parameters of log (U_H) = -2.7 to -2.1, and electron number densities of log (n_e) =1.45-2.85[cm^{-2}]. The distances of the outflows from the central source are between 4.5 to 31 kpc, and the kinetic luminosities range from 2\times10^{-6} to 5\times10^{-3} of the Eddington luminosity. The outflows in J1407 and J1032 show the largest kinetic luminosities, with momentum flux ratios (\dot{p} / \dot{p}_{rad}) of about 2 and 0.2, respectively. Our findings highlight the vital role of DESI data in uncovering the diversity and significance of quasar outflows in galaxy evolution.         |

|**Abstract**|            Recently, the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from the DESI survey have suggested hints of dynamical dark energy, challenging the standard $\Lambda $CDM model. In this work, we adopt an improved inverse distance ladder approach based on the latest cosmological data to provide a model-independent perspective, employing a global parametrization based on cosmic age (PAge). Our analysis incorporates DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmic chronometer (CC) data, and type Ia supernovae (SNe) observations from either the DESY5 or PantheonPlus datasets. For the DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets, we obtain $H_0 = 67.91 \pm 2.33~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$. This value is consistent with the Planck 2018 result, while shows $2.0 \sigma$ tension with the SH0ES measurement. Furthermore, by mapping specific cosmological models into PAge approximation parameter space $(p_{\mathrm{age}}, \eta)$, our model-independent analysis reveals a notable deviation from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model, as indicated by the DESY5 and DESI DR2 datasets. Finally, DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets provide nearly decisive evidence favoring the PAge model over the standard $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the expansion history to better understand the deviations from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model.         |
