|**Abstract**|            The detection of the extended X-ray-emission of the intracluster medium by the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1), combined with optical and near-infrared follow-up, resulted in the identification of more than 12000 galaxy clusters, yielding precise constraints on cosmological parameters. However, some clusters of galaxies can be misclassified as point sources by eROSITA's source detection algorithm due to the interplay between the point-spread function, the shallow depth of the survey, compact (cool core) X-ray emission, and bright active galactic nuclei hosted in their centers or their vicinity. To identify such misclassified galaxy clusters and groups, we apply optical follow-up to the eRASS1 X-ray point sources analogously to the treatment of the extent-selected catalog. After rigorous filtering to ensure purity, we find a total of 8347 clusters of galaxies, of which 5819 are novel detections, in a redshift range $0.05 < z \lesssim 1.1$. This corresponds to a 70 % discovery rate, a fraction similar to that of the extent-selected sample. To facilitate finding new exceptional clusters such as the Phoenix cluster (which is recovered in our sample), we divide the clusters into five classes based on the optical properties of likely single-source counterparts to the X-ray emission. We further investigate potential biases in our selection process by analyzing the optical and X-ray data. With this work, we provide a catalog of galaxy clusters and groups in the eRASS1 point source catalog, including their optical and X-ray properties along with a meaningful classification.         |

|*Comments*| *accepted by RAA*|
|**Abstract**|            We propose that the core mass function (CMF) can be driven by filament fragmentation. To model a star-forming system of filaments and fibers, we develop a fractal and turbulent tree with a fractal dimension of 2 and a Larson's law exponent ($\beta$) of 0.5. The fragmentation driven by convergent flows along the splines of the fractal tree yields a Kroupa-IMF-like CMF that can be divided into three power-law segments with exponents $\alpha$ = $-0.5$, $-1.5$, and $-2$, respectively. The turnover masses of the derived CMF are approximately four times those of the Kroupa IMF, corresponding to a star formation efficiency of 0.25. Adopting $\beta=1/3$, which leads to fractional Brownian motion along the filament, may explain a steeper CMF at the high-mass end, with $\alpha=-3.33$ close to that of the Salpeter IMF. We suggest that the fibers of the tree are basic building blocks of star formation, with similar properties across different clouds, establishing a common density threshold for star formation and leading to a universal CMF.         |
