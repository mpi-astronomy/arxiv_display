|**Abstract**|            We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations for a sample of $45$ quasars at $6.50 < z \leq 7.64$ with absolute magnitudes at $1450$ Å in the range $-28.82 \leq M_{1450} \leq -24.13$ and their composite spectrum. The median redshift and $M_{1450}$ of the quasars in the sample are $z_{\rm{median}}=6.71$ and $M_{1450,\rm{median}} \simeq -26.1$, respectively. The NIR spectra are taken with echelle spectrographs, complemented with additional data from optical long slit instruments, and then reduced consistently using the open-source Python-based spectroscopic data reduction pipeline PypeIt. The median value of the mean signal-to-noise ratios of the spectra in J, H, and K band (median $\langle \rm{SNR}_{\lambda} \rangle$) is: median $\langle \rm{SNR}_{J} \rangle=9.7$, median $\langle \rm{SNR}_{H} \rangle=10.3$, and median $\langle \rm{SNR}_{K} \rangle=11.7$; demonstrating the good data quality. This work presents the largest medium/moderate-resolution sample of quasars at $z>6.5$ from ground-based instruments. Its homogeneity and reproducibility make it ideally suited for several scientific goals, i.e., the study of the quasar proximity zones and damping wings, the Ly$\alpha$ forest, the intergalactic medium's metal content, as well as other properties such as the distribution of SMBH masses and Eddington ratios. Our composite spectrum is compared to others at both high and low-$z$ from the literature, showing differences in the strengths of many emission lines, probably due to differences in luminosity among the samples, but a consistent continuum slope, which proves that the same spectral features are preserved in quasars at different redshift ranges.         |

|**Abstract**|            The amount of turbulence in protoplanetary discs around young stars is critical for determining the efficiency, timeline, and outcomes of planet formation. It is also difficult to measure. Observations are still limited, but direct measurements of the non-thermal, turbulent gas motion are possible with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Using CO(2-1)/$^{13}$CO(2-1)/C$^{18}$O(2-1) ALMA observations of the disc around IM Lup at ~0.4" (~60 au) resolution we find evidence of significant turbulence, at the level of $\delta v_{\rm turb}=(0.18-0.30)$c$_s$. This result is robust against systematic uncertainties (e.g., amplitude flux calibration, midplane gas temperature, disc self-gravity). We find that gravito-turbulence as the source of the gas motion is unlikely based on the lack of an imprint on the rotation curve from a massive disc, while magneto-rotational instabilities and hydrodynamic instabilities are still possible, depending on the unknown magnetic field strength and the cooling timescale in the outer disc.         |

|**Abstract**|            Sulfur chemistry in the formation process of low-mass stars and planets remains poorly understood. The protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are the birthplace of planets and its distinctive environment provides an intriguing platform for investigating models of sulfur chemistry. We analyzed the ALMA observations of CS 7-6 transitions in the HD 163296 disk and perform astrochemical modeling to explore its sulfur chemistry. We simulated the distribution of sulfur-containing molecules and compared it with observationally deduced fractional column densities. We have found that the simulated column density of CS is consistent with the observationally deduced fractional column densities, while the simulated column density of C$_2$S is lower than the observationally deduced upper limits on column densities. This results indicate that we have a good understanding of the chemical properties of CS and C$_2$S in the disk. We also investigated the influence of the C/O ratio on sulfur-containing molecules and found that the column densities of SO, SO$_2$, and H$_2$S near the central star are dependent on the C/O ratio. Additionally, we found that the $N$[CS]/$N$[SO] ratio can serve as a promising indicator of the disk's C/O ratio in the HD 163296. Overall, the disk of HD 163296 provides a favorable environment for the detection of sulfur-containing molecules.         |
