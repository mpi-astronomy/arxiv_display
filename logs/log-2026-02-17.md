|**Abstract**|            Dark sectors consisting of atomic constituents (electrons, protons, and photons) offer a well-motivated extension to the Standard Model while providing multiple avenues for phenomenological study. In this work, we explore the impact of conversions between the dark and Standard Model photons in the primordial CMB spectral distortion epoch ($10^3 \lesssim z \lesssim 10^6$). These conversions are resonantly enhanced when the induced thermal masses of both photonic species are equal, thus leading to the possibility that sizeable distortions can be produced. To this end, we solve the Boltzmann equation at early times to determine the (irreducible) freeze-in or freeze-out abundance of dark photons. This procedure also allows us to update the limits on generic milli-charged dark sectors using the ACT DR6 bound on the number of effective radiative degrees of freedom ($N_{\rm eff}$). By then modeling the evolution of the thermal masses in both sectors, we compute the primordial CMB distortion using the Landau-Zener formalism. We find that when the dark electron and proton are roughly similar in mass (the positronium limit), current spectral distortion data from the COBE/FIRAS instrument is able to rule out novel regions of parameter space. We also forecast bounds from the proposed FOSSIL satellite, finding that spectral distortions can also be used to probe the ultra-low dark electric charge regions of parameter space, which are difficult to investigate by other means.         |

|| M. Murray, C. Hall, <mark>H. Baehr</mark>, J. Terry |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-02-17*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            Protoplanetary disc mass is one of the most fundamental properties of a planet-forming system, as it sets the total mass budget available for planet formation. However, obtaining disc mass measurements remain challenging, since it is not possible to directly detect H$_2$, and CO abundance ratios are poorly constrained. Dynamical measurements of the disc mass are now possible, but they are not suited to all discs since the measurements typically require well-behaved emission surfaces. A long-standing method is to obtain continuum flux measurements from the dust emission, and convert to a total disc mass by assumption of the dust-to-gas mass ratio, $\epsilon$. This quantity is poorly constrained in protoplanetary discs. % We investigate the impact of $\epsilon$ on the morphology of planet-containing hydrodynamical simulations of dusty protoplanetary accretion discs, and suggest that if a planet mass estimate can be obtained, then disc morphology could be used to constrain $\epsilon$ in observed systems relative to each other, improving the total disc mass estimates of protoplanetary discs.         |

|| <mark>J. Li</mark>, P. Nath |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-02-17*|
|*Comments*| *13 pages, 5 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            The recent detection of a gravitational wave background in the nano-Hertz frequency range by Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations, including NANOGrav, EPTA, and PPTA, has opened a new avenue for exploring fundamental physics in the early universe. In this work, we analyze a supercooled first-order phase transition in a hidden sector with a spontaneously broken $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry as a source for this signal. We demonstrate that the thermal history of the hidden and visible sectors plays a crucial role in the gravitational wave power spectrum analysis. Our analysis shows that supercooled phase transitions can generate gravitational waves strong enough to explain the PTA observations while satisfying cosmological constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.         |

|| <mark>J. Li</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-02-17*|
|*Comments*| *Code, data, and full experimental configurations are available at: this https URL*|
|**Abstract**|            We construct a concept-object knowledge graph from the full astro-ph corpus through July 2025. Using an automated pipeline, we extract named astrophysical objects from OCR-processed papers, resolve them to SIMBAD identifiers, and link them to scientific concepts annotated in the source corpus. We then test whether historical graph structure can forecast new concept-object associations before they appear in print. Because the concepts are derived from clustering and therefore overlap semantically, we apply an inference-time concept-similarity smoothing step uniformly to all methods. Across four temporal cutoffs on a physically meaningful subset of concepts, an implicit-feedback matrix factorization model (alternating least squares, ALS) with smoothing outperforms the strongest neighborhood baseline (KNN using text-embedding concept similarity) by 16.8% on NDCG@100 (0.144 vs 0.123) and 19.8% on Recall@100 (0.175 vs 0.146), and exceeds the best recency heuristic by 96% and 88%, respectively. These results indicate that historical literature encodes predictive structure not captured by global heuristics or local neighborhood voting, suggesting a path toward tools that could help triage follow-up targets for scarce telescope time.         |

|| P. A. Collaboration, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-02-17*|
|*Comments*| *15 pages, 9 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            Quantum gravity theories often modify spacetime symmetries. In particular, Lorentz invariance may be violated when approaching the Planck scale. Although the scales at which interactions occur in extensive air showers induced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the atmosphere are many orders of magnitude below the Planck scale, these violations might still be observable. In this work, the fluctuations in the number of muons in the extensive air showers measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory are exploited, for the first time, to constrain Lorentz invariance violations. The bounds derived in the hadronic sector are the strongest ever obtained, and do not rely on assumptions about the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The fluctuations in the number of muons constitute a new and powerful observable to further explore Lorentz invariance in a region of the parameter space not accessible to other observables.         |

|| <mark>J. Li</mark>, X. Shi, M.-T. Hui, <mark>J. Shi</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-02-17*|
|*Comments*| *14 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in ApJL*|
|**Abstract**|            Interstellar comets provide rare opportunities for probing the diversity of refractory and volatile inventory around other stars. As the second ever interstellar comet, and the third interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS has been the focus of telescopic observations since its discovery in July 2025. Following the previous observations at multi-wavelengths, we present further radio observations of the 1665/1667 MHz ground-state OH lines and millimeter observations of the CO($J$=1-0) transition at 115.271 GHz that trace the coma $\rm H_2O$ and CO abundances, respectively. We derived OH production rates of $(1.32\pm0.47)\times10^{28}\ \rm s^{-1}$ at 2.27 au and $(1.89\pm0.37)\times10^{28}\ \rm s^{-1}$ at 1.96 au as well as an average CO production rate of $\rm (5.75\pm1.91) \times 10^{27}\, s^{-1}$ between 2.33 and 1.75 au, inferring a CO/$\rm H_2O$ ratio of ($28\pm11\%$). With the mean HCN production rate of $2.5\times 10^{25}\ \rm s^{-1}$ at 2.1 au reported by \citet{2025arXiv251120845R} and \citet{2025arXiv251002817C}, we infer a CO/HCN ratio of ($230\pm76$). By synthesizing water production rates measured with instruments of different apertures, we found that the sublimation from extended source in the coma contributes significantly to 3I's pre-perihelion water measurements, accounting for up to 80\% from 3 au to 2 au.         |
