|**Abstract**|            We analyze two dusty star-forming galaxies at $z=6.6$. These galaxies are selected from the ASPIRE survey, a JWST Cycle-1 medium and ALMA Cycle-9 large program targeting 25 quasars and their environments at $z\simeq6.5 - 6.8$. These galaxies are identified as companions to UV-luminous quasars and robustly detected in ALMA continuum and [C II] emission, yet they are extraordinarily faint at the NIRCam wavelengths (down to $>28.0$ AB mag in the F356W band). They are more obscured than galaxies like Arp220, and thus we refer to them as "NIRCam-dark" starburst galaxies (star formation rate $\simeq 80 - 250\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$). Such galaxies are typically missed by (sub)-millimeter blank-field surveys. From the star-formation history (SFH), we show that the NIRCam-dark galaxies are viable progenitors of massive quiescent galaxies at $z\gtrsim4$ and descendants of UV-luminous galaxies at $z>10$. Although it is hard to constrain their number density from a quasar survey, we conclude that NIRCam-dark galaxies can be as abundant as $n\sim10^{-5.5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ assuming a light halo occupation model. If true, this would equal to $\sim$30% of the number densities of both the quiescent galaxies at $z\gtrsim4$ and UV-luminous galaxies at $z>10$. We further predict that analogs at $z\sim8$ should exist according to the SFH of early massive quiescent galaxies. However, they may fall below the current detection limits of wide JWST and ALMA surveys, thus remaining "JWST-dark". To fully trace the evolution of massive galaxies and dust-obscured cosmic star formation at $z\gtrsim8$, wide-field JWST/NIRCam imaging and slitless spectroscopic surveys of early protoclusters are essential.         |

|| J. Huang, et al. -- incl., <mark>M. Benisty</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-06-10*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted by ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            Millimeter continuum spiral arms have so far only been detected in a handful of protoplanetary disks, and thus we have a limited understanding of the circumstances in which they can form. In particular, substructures in small disks ($R\lessapprox 50$ au) have not been well-characterized in comparison with large disks. We present ALMA 1.3 mm continuum observations of the disk around the T Tauri star Haro 6-13 at a resolution of $\sim0.04''$ ($\sim5$ au). A pair of low-contrast spiral arms are detected at disk radii from $\sim10-35$ au. They can be approximated as Archimedean spirals with pitch angles ranging from $\sim10-30^\circ$. The low value of the disk-averaged spectral index between 1.3 and 3 mm ($\alpha=2.1$) and the high brightness temperatures suggest that the millimeter continuum is likely optically thick and thus may hide sufficient mass for the disk to become gravitationally unstable and form spiral arms. CO observations have shown that Haro 6-13 is surrounded by an envelope, raising the possibility that infall is facilitating spiral arm formation.         |

|| S. Mészáros, et al. -- incl., <mark>G. Guiglion</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            The goal of this paper is to describe the science verification of Milky Way Mapper (MWM) ASPCAP data products published in Data Release 19 (DR19) of the fifth phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V). We compare MWM ASPCAP atmospheric parameters T$_{\rm eff}$, log g, 24 abundances of 21 elements (carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen have multiple sources for deriving their abundance values) and their uncertainties determined from APOGEE spectrograph spectra with those of the literature and evaluate their accuracy and precision. We also test the zero-point calibration of the v$_{\rm rad}$ derived by the APOGEE Data Reduction Pipeline. This data release contains ASPCAP parameters for 964,989 stars, including all APOGEE-2 targets expanded with new observations of 336,511 stars from the Apache Point Observatory (APO) observed until 4 July 2023. Overall, the new T$_{\rm eff}$ values show excellent agreement with the IRFM scale, while the surface gravities exhibit slight systematic offsets compared to asteroseisimic gravities. The estimated precision of T$_{\rm eff}$ is between 50 and 70 K for giants and 70$-$100 K for dwarfs, while surface gravities are measured with a precision of 0.07$-$0.09 dex for giants. We achieve an estimated precision of 0.02$-$0.04 dex for multiple elements, including metallicity, $\alpha$, Mg, and Si, while the precision of at least 10 elements is better than 0.1 dex.         |

|| A. C. Gordon, et al. -- incl., <mark>Y. Wang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-06-10*|

|**Abstract**|            We present deep optical and near-infrared observations of the host galaxies of 34 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transient (CRAFT) survey on the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) to compare the locations of FRBs relative to their host light distributions. Incorporating three additional FRBs from the literature, for a total of four repeating and 33 apparently non-repeating FRBs, we determine their projected galactocentric offsets and find a median of $ 4.2^{+5.7}_{-2.5}$ kpc ($1.0^{+1.5}_{-0.6}r_e$). We model their host surface brightness profiles and develop synthetic spatial distributions of their globular clusters based on host properties. We calculate the likelihood the observed location of each FRB is consistent with the smooth light of its host galaxy, residual (primarily spiral) substructure, or globular cluster distributions. The majority of FRBs favor locations within the disks of their galaxies, while only 7-13\% favor a globular cluster origin, primarily those with galactocentric offsets $\gtrsim3r_e$. At $z<0.15$, where spiral structure is apparent in 86\% of our sample of FRB hosts, we find $\approx 20-46\%$ of FRBs favor an association with spiral arms. Assuming FRBs derive from magnetars, our results support multiple formation channels with the majority of progenitors associated with massive stars and a minority formed through dynamical channels. However, the moderate fraction of FRBs associated with spiral structure indicates that high star formation efficiency of the youngest and most massive stars is not a predominant driver in the production of FRB progenitors.         |

|| <mark>B. Saha</mark>, M. K. Nandy |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-06-10*|
|*Comments*| *23 pages with 7 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            We explore the inflationary evolution and observational viability of the $\alpha$-attractor E-model in the framework of warm inflation, focusing on both weak and strong dissipative regimes, with a dissipation coefficient linear in temperature. In the strong regime, we account for the growth of inflaton fluctuations due to coupling with the radiation bath via two different forms for the dissipation enhancement function: one associated with plateau-like potentials, and another motivated by the warm little inflation scenario. Employing slow roll conditions, we analytically derive the expressions for the key inflationary observables, the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, in both dissipative regimes. The resulting theoretical trajectories on the $n_s$--$r$ plane are then juxtaposed with the contour plots obtained from Planck 2018 data in order to constrain the model parameter. Our analysis shows that the warm $\alpha$-attractor E-model remains compatible with observations in both dissipative regimes, with dissipation playing a crucial role in shifting the predictions and enlarging the viable parameter space, highlighting observational robustness of the model when extended to warm inflation.         |

|| <mark>X. Zhang</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-06-10*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            We aim to detect low-frequency radio emission from exoplanetary systems, which can provide insights into planetary magnetic fields, star-planet interactions, stellar activity, and exo-space weather. The HD 189733 system, hosting a well-studied hot Jupiter, is a prime target for such searches. We conducted NenuFAR imaging observations in the 15-62 MHz range, in order to cover the entire orbital phase of HD 189733 b. Dynamic spectra were generated for the target and other sources in the field, followed by a transient search in the time-frequency plane. The data processing pipeline incorporated direction-dependent calibration and noise characterization to improve sensitivity. We also searched for periodic signals using Lomb-Scargle analysis. A highly circularly polarized radio burst was detected at 50 MHz with a flux density of 1.5 Jy and a significance of 6 sigma at the position of HD 189733. No counterpart was found in Stokes I, likely because the emission is embedded in confusion noise and remains below the detection threshold. The estimated minimum fractional circular polarization of 38% suggests a coherent emission process. A periodicity search revealed no weaker signals linked to the planet's orbital period, the star's rotational period, or the synodic period and harmonic period between them. The burst's properties are consistent with cyclotron maser instability (CMI) emission, but the origin is still ambiguous. The comparison with theoretical models suggests star-planet interaction or stellar activity as potential origins. However, alternative explanations such as contamination from other sources along the line of sight (e.g. the companion M dwarf) or noise fluctuation cannot be ruled out.         |

|**Abstract**|            By January 2025, 60 pulsars were discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope globular cluster (GC) pulsar survey (GC FANS), with spin periods spanning 1.98 ms to 3960.72 ms. Of these, 55 are millisecond pulsars (MSPs; $P<30$ ms), while 34 are binaries with orbital periods spanning 0.12 days to 466.47 days. This paper describes GC FANS, a deep, thorough search for pulsars in 41 GCs in the FAST sky ($-14^\circ < \delta < 65^\circ$) and describes new discoveries in 14 of them. We present updated timing solutions for M92A, NGC 6712A, M71A, and M71E, all of which are ``spider'' pulsars with short orbital periods. We present new timing solutions for M71B, C, and D. With orbital periods of $\sim$466 and 378 days, M71B and M71C are the widest known GC binaries; these systems resemble the normal wide MSP-He WD systems in the Galactic disk. With a spin period of 101 ms, M71D is in an eccentric ($e\sim$0.63) orbit with an 11-day period and a massive companion; the system has a total mass of $2.63 \pm 0.08 \, M_{\odot}$. These features and its large characteristic age suggest it is a double neutron star system (DNS) formed via massive binary evolution early in the cluster's history, akin to Galactic disk DNSs--unlike other candidate GC DNSs, which typically form dynamically. A comparative analysis of GC pulsar populations within FAST's sky reveals that most clusters (10 of 14) resemble the Galactic disk MSP population, likely due to lower stellar densities.         |
