|**Abstract**| The internal velocity structure within dense gaseous cores plays a crucial role in providing the initial conditions for star formation in molecular clouds. However, the kinematic properties of dense gas at core scales (~0.01 - 0.1 pc) has not been extensively characterized because of instrument limitations until the unique capabilities of GBT-Argus became available. The ongoing GBT-Argus Large Program, Dynamics in Star-forming Cores (DiSCo) thus aims to investigate the origin and distribution of angular momenta of star-forming cores. DiSCo will survey all starless cores and Class 0 protostellar cores in the Perseus molecular complex down to ~0.01 pc scales with < 0.05 km/s velocity resolution using the dense gas tracer N$_2$H$^+$. Here, we present the first datasets from DiSCo toward the B1 and NGC 1333 regions in Perseus. Our results suggest that a dense core's internal velocity structure has little correlation with other core-scale properties, indicating these gas motions may be originated externally from cloud-scale turbulence. These first datasets also reaffirm the ability of GBT-Argus for studying dense core velocity structure and provided an empirical basis for future studies that address the angular momentum problem with a statistically broad sample. |

|**Abstract**| Estimating precise metallicity of M dwarfs is a well-known difficult problem due to their complex spectra. In this work, we empirically calibrate the metallicity using wide binaries with a F, G, or K dwarf and a M dwarf companion. With 1308 FGK+M wide binaries well observed by LAMOST, we calibrated M dwarf's [Fe/H] by using the Stellar LAbel Machine (SLAM) model, a data-driven method based on support vector regression (SVR). The [Fe/H] labels of the training data are from FGK companions in range of [-1,0.5] dex. The Teffs are selected from Li et al. (2021), spanning [3100,4400] K. The uncertainties in SLAM estimates of [Fe/H] and Teff are ~0.15 dex and ~40 K, respectively, at snri > 100, where snri is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at i-band of M dwarf spectra. We applied the trained SLAM model to determine the [Fe/H] and Teff for ~630,000 M dwarfs with low-resolution spectra in LAMOST DR9. Compared to other literature also using FGK+M wide binaries for calibration, our [Fe/H] estimates show no bias but a scatter of ~ 0.14-0.18 dex. However, the [Fe/H] compared to APOGEE shows a systematic difference of ~ 0.10-0.15 dex with a scatter of ~ 0.15-0.20 dex. While the Teff compared to APOGEE has a bias of 3 K with a scatter of 62 K, it is systematically higher by 180 K compared to other calibrations based on the bolometric temperature. Finally, we calculated the zeta index for 1308 M dwarf secondaries and presents a moderate correlation between zeta and [Fe/H]. |
