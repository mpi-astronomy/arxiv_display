|**Abstract**|            Recent observations have positioned the endpoint of the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) at redshift $z \sim 5.3$. However, observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest have not yet been able to discern whether reionisation occurred slowly and late, with substantial neutral hydrogen persisting at redshift $\sim 6$, or rapidly and earlier, with the apparent late end driven by the fluctuating UV background. Gunn-Peterson (GP) absorption troughs are solid indicators that reionisation is not complete until $z=5.3$, but whether they contain significantly neutral gas has not yet been proven. We aim to answer this question by directly measuring, for the first time, the neutral hydrogen fraction ($x_\mathrm{HI}$) at the end of the EoR ($5 \lesssim z \lesssim 6$) in high-redshift quasars spectra. For high neutral fractions $x_\mathrm{HI}\gtrsim0.1$, GP troughs exhibit damping wing (DW) absorption extending over $1000$ km s$^{-1}$ beyond the troughs. While conclusively detected in Lyman-$\alpha$ emission lines of quasars at $z\geq7$, DWs are challenging to observe in the general Lyman-$\alpha$ forest due to absorption complexities and small-scale stochastic transmission features. We report the first successful identification of the stochastic DW signal adjacent to GP troughs at redshifts $z=5.6$ through careful stacking of the dark gaps in Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We use the signal to present a measurement of the corresponding global $x_\mathrm{HI}=0.19\pm0.07$ $(_{-0.16}^{+0.11})$ at $1\sigma$ $(2\sigma)$ at $z=5.6$ and a limit $x_\mathrm{HI}<0.44$ at $z=5.9$. The detection of this signal demonstrates the existence of substantially neutral islands near the conclusion of the EoR, unequivocally signaling a late-and-slow reionization scenario.         |

|**Abstract**|            Recent quasar absorption line observations suggest that reionization may end as late as $z \approx 5.3$. As a means to search for large neutral hydrogen islands at $z<6$, we revisit long dark gaps in the Ly$\beta$ forest in VLT/X-Shooter and Keck/ESI quasar spectra. We stack the Ly$\alpha$ forest corresponding to the edges of these Ly$\beta$ dark gaps and identify a damping wing-like extended absorption profile. The average redshift of the stacked forest is $z=5.8$. By comparing these observations with reionization simulations, we infer that such a damping wing-like feature can be naturally explained if these gaps are at least partially created by neutral islands. Conversely, simulated dark gaps lacking neutral hydrogen struggle to replicate the observed damping wing features. Furthermore, this damping wing-like profile implies that the volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fraction must be $\langle x_{\rm HI} \rangle \geq 6.1 \pm 3.9\%$ at $z = 5.8$. Our results offer robust evidence that reionization extends below $z=6$.         |

|**Abstract**|            Ground-based observations of `Barbarian' L-type asteroids at 1 to 2.5-$\mu$m indicate that their near-infrared spectra are dominated by the mineral spinel, which has been attributed to a high abundance of calcium-aluminum inclusions (CAIs) -- the first solids to condense out of the protoplanetary disk during the formation of the Solar System. However, the spectral properties of these asteroids from 2.5 to 5-$\mu$m, a wavelength region that covers signatures of hydrated minerals, water, and organics, have not yet been explored. Here, we present 2 to 5-$\mu$m reflectance spectra of five spinel-rich asteroids obtained with the NIRSpec instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope. All five targets exhibit a $\sim$ 2.85-$\mu$m absorption feature with a band depth of 3-6$\%$ that appears correlated in strength with that of the 2-$\mu$m spinel absorption feature. The shape and position of the 2.85-$\mu$m feature are not a good match to the 2.7-$\mu$m feature commonly seen in carbonaceous CM meteorites or C-type asteroids. The closest spectral matches are to the Moon and Vesta, suggesting commonalities in aqueous alteration across silicate bodies, infall of hydrated material, and/or space weathering by solar wind H implantation. Lab spectra of CO/CV chondrites, CAIs, as well as the minerals cronstedtite and spinel, also show a similar feature, providing clues into the origin of the 2.85-$\mu$m feature.         |

|| A. E. Bayer, <mark>J. Liu</mark>, C. D. Kreisch, A. Pisani |

|**Abstract**|            Massive neutrinos suppress the growth of cosmic structure on nonlinear scales, motivating the use of information beyond the power spectrum to tighten constraints on the neutrino mass, for example by considering cosmic voids. It was recently proposed that constraints on neutrino mass from the halo mass function (HMF) can be improved by considering only the halos that reside within voids -- the void-halo mass function (VHMF). We extend this analysis, which made spherical assumptions about the shape of voids, to take into account the non-spherical nature of voids as defined by the Voronoi-tessellation-based void finder, VIDE. In turn, after accounting for one spurious non-spherical void, we find no evidence that the VHMF contains information beyond the HMF. Given this finding, we then introduce a novel summary statistic by splitting halos according to the emptiness of their individual environments, defined by the Voronoi cell volume each halo resides in, and combining the mass functions from each split. We name the corresponding statistic the VorHMF and find that it could provide information regarding neutrino mass beyond the HMF. Our work thus motivates the importance of accounting for the full shape of voids in future analyses, both in terms of removing outliers to achieve robust results and as an additional source of cosmological information.         |

|**Abstract**|            This study presented the first light curve analysis of the OP Boo and V0511 Cam binary stars, which was conducted in the frame of the Binary Systems of South and North (BSN) Project. Photometric ground-based observations were conducted with standard filters at two observatories in the Czech Republic. We computed a new ephemeris for each of the systems using our extracted times of minima, TESS data, and additional literature. Linear fits for O-C diagrams of both systems were considered using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The light curves were analyzed using the Wilson-Devinney (WD) binary code combined with the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The light curve solutions of both target systems required a cold starspot. The absolute parameters of the systems were calculated by using a P-M parameter relationship. The positions of the systems were also depicted on the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR), P-L, logMtot-logJ0, and T-M diagrams. The second component in both systems is determined to be a more massive and hotter star. Therefore, it can be concluded that both systems are W-type contact binary systems.         |

|**Abstract**|            The SALTUS Probe mission will provide a powerful far-infrared (far-IR) pointed space observatory to explore our cosmic origins and the possibility of life elsewhere. The observatory employs an innovative deployable 14-m aperture, with a sunshield that will radiatively cool the off-axis primary to <45K. This cooled primary reflector works in tandem with cryogenic coherent and incoherent instruments that span the 34 to 660 micron far-IR range at both high and moderate spectral resolutions.         |
