|**Abstract**|            The physical processes that led to the formation of billion solar mass black holes within the first 700 million years of cosmic time remain a puzzle. Several theoretical scenarios have been proposed to seed and rapidly grow black holes, but direct observations of these mechanisms remain elusive. Here we present a source 660 million years after the Big Bang that displays singular properties: among the largest Hydrogen Balmer breaks reported at any redshift, broad multi-peaked H$\beta$ emission, and Balmer line absorption in multiple transitions. We model this source as a "black hole star" (BH*) where the Balmer break and absorption features are a result of extremely dense, turbulent gas forming a dust-free "atmosphere" around a supermassive black hole. This source may provide evidence of an early black hole embedded in dense gas -- a theoretical configuration proposed to rapidly grow black holes via super-Eddington accretion. Radiation from the BH* appears to dominate almost all observed light, leaving limited room for contribution from its host galaxy. We demonstrate that the recently discovered "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) with perplexing spectral energy distributions can be explained as BH*s embedded in relatively brighter host galaxies. This source provides evidence that black hole masses in the LRDs may be over-estimated by orders of magnitude -- the BH* is effectively dust-free contrary to the steep dust corrections applied while modeling LRDs, and the physics that gives rise to the complex line shapes and luminosities may deviate from assumptions underlying standard scaling relations.         |

|**Abstract**|            The origin of the rest-optical emission of compact, red, high-redshift sources known as `little red dots' (LRDs) poses a major puzzle. If interpreted as starlight, it would imply that LRDs would constitute the densest stellar systems in the Universe. However, alternative models suggest active galactic nuclei (AGN) may instead power the rest-optical continuum. Here, we present JWST/NIRSpec, NIRCam and MIRI observations from the RUBIES and PRIMER programs of The Cliff: a bright LRD at $z=3.55$ with an exceptional Balmer break, twice as strong as that of any high-redshift source previously observed. The spectra also reveal broad Hydrogen (H$\alpha\ \rm FWHM\sim1500$km/s) and He I emission, but no significant metal lines. We demonstrate that massive evolved stellar populations cannot explain the observed spectrum, even when considering unusually steep and strong dust attenuation, or reasonable variations in the initial mass function. Moreover, the formally best-fit stellar mass and compact size ($M_*\sim10^{10.5}\,M_\odot,\ r_{e}\sim40\,$pc) would imply densities at which near-monthly stellar collisions might lead to significant X-ray emission. We argue that the Balmer break, emission lines, and H$\alpha$ absorption line are instead most plausibly explained by a `black hole star' (BH*) scenario, in which dense gas surrounds a powerful ionising source. In contrast to recently proposed BH* models of dust-reddened AGN, we show that spectral fits in the rest UV to near-infrared favour an intrinsically redder continuum over strong dust reddening. This may point to a super-Eddington accreting massive black hole or, possibly, the presence of (super)massive stars in a nuclear star cluster. The Cliff is the clearest evidence to date that at least some LRDs are not ultra-dense, massive galaxies, and are instead powered by a central ionising source embedded in dense, absorbing gas.         |

|**Abstract**|            The sub-Neptune planets have no solar system analogues, and their low bulk densities suggest thick atmospheres containing degenerate quantities of volatiles and H/He, surrounding cores of unknown sizes. Measurements of their atmospheric composition can help break these degeneracies, but many previous studies at low spectral resolution have largely been hindered by clouds or hazes, returning muted spectra. Here, we present the first comprehensive study of a short-period sub-Neptune using ground-based, high-resolution spectroscopy, which is sensitive to the cores of spectral lines that can extend above potential high altitude aerosol layers. We observe four CRIRES+ $\textit{K}$-band transits of the warm sub-Neptune GJ 3090 b (T$_{\text{eq}}$ = 693$\pm$18 K) which orbits an M2V host star. Despite the high quality data and sensitivity to CH$_4$, H$_2$O, NH$_3$, and H$_2$S, we detect no molecular species. Injection-recovery tests are consistent with two degenerate scenarios. First, GJ 3090 b may host a highly metal-enriched atmosphere with $>\,$150 Z$_{\odot}$ and mean molecular weight $>\,$7.1 g mol$^{-1}$, representing a volatile dominated envelope with a H/He mass fraction $x_{\text{H/He}} < 33\%$, and an unconstrained aerosol layer. Second, the data are consistent with a high altitude cloud or haze layer at pressures $<\,$3.3$\times$10$^{-5}~$bar, for any metallicity. GJ 3090 b joins the growing evidence to suggest that high metallicity atmospheres and high altitude aerosol layers are common within the warm (500$~<T_{\text{eq}}<~$800 K) sub-Neptune population. We discuss the observational challenges posed by the M-dwarf host star, and suggest observing strategies for transmission spectroscopy of challenging targets around M-dwarfs for existing and ELT instrumentation.         |

|| S. Rojas-Ruiz, et al. -- incl., <mark>E. Ba√±ados</mark>, <mark>Y. Khusanova</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            We present the first study dedicated to measuring the timescales for black hole accretion and jet launch in a quasar at the edge of Reionization, PSO J352.4034-15.3373 at z = 5.832 $\pm$ 0.001. Previous work presented evidence of the strong radio synchrotron emission from the jet affecting the host galaxy dust-dominated continuum emission at $\nu_{\rm rest}=683$ GHz ($\nu_{\rm obs}=100$ GHz), implying a break in the synchrotron spectrum. In this work, we present quasi-simultaneous observations at 1.5\, GHz - 42\,GHz with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), and derive a frequency break at $\nu^{\rm break}_{\rm rest} = 196.46$ GHz ($\nu^{\rm break}_{\rm obs} = 28.76$ GHz). Modeling these observations, we calculate the jet spectral aging from the cooling of electrons to be $t_{\mathrm{spec}}\sim 580$ yr. From this measurement, we approximate the dynamical age $t_{\mathrm{dyn}}$ to be $\sim2,000$ yr, implying a recent jet ejection. We compare the jet timescale to the quasar's lifetime ($t_{\mathrm{Q}}$) that indicates the duration of the latest black hole accretion event and is derived from the proximity zone size in the rest-UV/optical spectrum. However, a ghostly Damped Ly$\alpha$ (DLA) system affects this measurement yielding an upper limit of $t_{\mathrm{Q}} \lesssim 10^4$ yr, consistent with the jet lifetime and indicative of a young quasar. This suggests that the triggering of a UV-bright quasar phase may occur within comparable timescales as the launch of a relativistic radio jet. Therefore, we may be witnessing an early stage of black hole and jet interactions in a quasar during the first gigayear of the universe.         |

|| S. S. Larsen, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. Jahnke</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-03-24*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted to A&A following internal review*|
|**Abstract**|            We examine the star cluster populations in the three nearby galaxies IC 342, NGC 2403, and Holmberg II, observed as part of the Euclid Early Release Observations programme. Our main focus is on old globular clusters (GCs), for which the wide field-of-view and excellent image quality of Euclid offer substantial advantages over previous work. For IC 342 this is the first study of stellar clusters other than its nuclear cluster. After selection based on size and magnitude criteria, followed by visual inspection, we identify 111 old (> 1 Gyr) GC candidates in IC 342, 50 in NGC 2403 (of which 15 were previously known), and 7 in Holmberg II. In addition, a number of younger and/or intermediate-age candidates are identified. The colour distributions of GC candidates in the two larger galaxies show hints of bimodality with peaks at IE-HE = 0.36 and 0.79 (IC 342) and IE-HE = 0.36 and 0.80 (NGC 2403), corresponding to metallicities of [Fe/H]=-1.5 and [Fe/H]=-0.5, similar to those of the metal-poor and metal-rich GC subpopulations in the Milky Way. The luminosity functions of our GC candidates exhibit an excess of relatively faint objects, relative to a canonical, approximately Gaussian GC luminosity function (GCLF). The excess objects may be similar to those previously identified in other galaxies. The specific frequency of classical old GCs in IC 342, as determined based on the brighter half of the GCLF, appears to be unusually low with SN=0.2-0.3. The combined luminosity function of young and intermediate-age clusters in all three galaxies is consistent with a power-law distribution, dN/dL ~ L^(-2.3+/-0.1) and the total numbers of young clusters brighter than M(IE)=-8 in NGC 2403 and Holmberg II are comparable with those found in their Local Group counterparts, that is, M33 and the Small Magellanic Cloud, respectively.         |

|**Abstract**|            Historically, various methods have been employed to understand the origin of the elements, including observations of elemental abundances which have been compared to Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. It is also well known that 1D Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) measurements fail to accurately capture elemental abundances. Non-LTE (NLTE) effects may play a significant role, and neglecting them leads to erroneous implications in galaxy modelling. In this paper, we calculate 3D NLTE abundances of seven key iron-peak and neutron-capture elements (Mn, Co, Ni, Sr, Y, Ba, Eu) based on carefully assembled 1D LTE literature measurements, and investigate their impact within the context of the OMEGA+ GCE model. Our findings reveal that 3D NLTE abundances are significantly higher for iron-peak elements at [Fe/H]< -3, with (for the first time ever) [Ni/Fe] and (confirming previous studies) [Co/Fe] on average reaching 0.6-0.8 dex, and [Mn/Fe] reaching -0.1 dex, which current 1D core-collapse supernova (CCSN) models cannot explain. We also observe a slightly higher production of neutron-capture elements at low metallicities, with 3D NLTE abundances of Eu being higher by +0.2 dex at [Fe/H]= -3. 3D effects are most significant for iron-peak elements in the very metal-poor regime, with average differences between 3D NLTE and 1D NLTE {reaching} up to 0.15 dex. Thus, ignoring 3D NLTE effects introduces significant biases, so including {them} should be considered whenever possible.         |

|**Abstract**|            Pyramid wavefront sensors (PWFSs) are the preferred choice for current and future extreme adaptive optics (XAO) systems. Almost all instruments use the PWFS in its modulated form to mitigate its limited linearity range. However, this modulation comes at the cost of a reduction in sensitivity, a blindness to petal-piston modes, and a limit to the sensor's ability to operate at high speeds. Therefore, there is strong interest to use the PWFS without modulation, which can be enabled with nonlinear reconstructors. Here, we present the first on-sky demonstration of XAO with an unmodulated PWFS using a nonlinear reconstructor based on convolutional neural networks. We discuss the real-time implementation on the Magellan Adaptive Optics eXtreme (MagAO-X) instrument using the optimized TensorRT framework and show that inference is fast enough to run the control loop at >2 kHz frequencies. Our on-sky results demonstrate a successful closed-loop operation using a model calibrated with internal source data that delivers stable and robust correction under varying conditions. Performance analysis reveals that our smart PWFS achieves nearly the same Strehl ratio as the highly optimized modulated PWFS under favorable conditions on bright stars. Notably, we observe an improvement in performance on a fainter star under the influence of strong winds. These findings confirm the feasibility of using the PWFS in its unmodulated form and highlight its potential for next-generation instruments. Future efforts will focus on achieving even higher control loop frequencies (>3 kHz), optimizing the calibration procedures, and testing its performance on fainter stars, where more gain is expected for the unmodulated PWFS compared to its modulated counterpart.         |

|**Abstract**|            Following a recent detection of TeV radiation by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) and the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC), coincident with the direction of the microquasar V4641 Sgr, we search for possible GeV emission from this source. We explored the morphology and temporal features of the source as well as two nearby unassociated point sources which could be a part of extended structure of V4641 Sgr, and compared results with corresponding X-ray and TeV emissions. The 95% confidence level upper limits for the flux from the source, assuming both point and extended source models were 5.38$\times$ 10$^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and 1.12$\times$ 10$^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively. Additionally, no correlation between gamma-ray light curve and X-ray outbursts was observed.         |
