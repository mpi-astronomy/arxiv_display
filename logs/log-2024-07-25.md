|**Abstract**|            Using data from Gaia DR3, we construct a sample of 14,791 gravitationally bound wide pairs in which one of the components is an unresolved binary with an astrometric orbital or acceleration solution. These systems are hierarchical triples, with inner binary separations of order $1$ au, and outer separations of $100$-$100,000$ au. Leveraging the fact that the inner binary and outer tertiary should have nearly identical parallaxes, we use the sample to calibrate the parallax uncertainties for orbital and acceleration binary solutions. We find that the parallax uncertainties of orbital solutions are typically underestimated by a factor of $1.3$ at $G>14$, and by a factor of $1.7$ at $G = 8$-$14$. The true parallax uncertainties are nevertheless a factor of $\sim 10$ smaller than those of the single-star astrometric solutions for the same sources. The parallax uncertainties of acceleration solutions are underestimated by larger factors of $2$-$3$ but still represent a significant improvement compared to the sources' single-star solutions. We provide tabulated uncertainty inflation factors for astrometric binary solutions and make the catalog of hierarchical triples publicly available.         |

|**Abstract**|            Streaming Instability (SI) in dust has long been thought to be a promising process in triggering planetesimal formation in the protoplanetary disks (PPDs). In this study, we present the first numerical investigation that models the SI in the vertically stratified disk together with the dust coagulation process. Our simulations reveal that, even with the initial small dust sizes, because dust coagulation promotes dust size growth, SI can eventually still be triggered. As such, the dust coagulation process broadens the parameter boundaries obtained from the previous SI studies using single dust species. We describe the various stages of dust dynamics along with their size evolution, and explore the impact of different dust fragmentation velocities. Implications of these results for realistic PPDs are also discussed.         |

|**Abstract**|            GroundBIRD is a ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment for observing the polarization pattern imprinted on large angular scales ($\ell > 6$ ) from the Teide Observatory in Tenerife, Spain. Our primary scientific objective is a precise measurement of the optical depth $\tau$ ($\sigma(\tau) \sim 0.01$) to the reionization epoch of the Universe to cross-check systematic effects in the measurements made by previous experiments. GroundBIRD observes a wide sky area in the Northern Hemisphere ($\sim 40\%$ of the full sky) while continuously rotating the telescope at a high speed of up to 20 rotations per minute (rpm) to overcome the fluctuations of atmospheric radiation. We have adopted the NbTiN/Al hybrid microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) as focal plane detectors. We observe two frequency bands centered at 145 GHz and 220 GHz. The 145 GHz band picks up the peak frequency of the CMB spectrum. The 220 GHz band helps accurate removal of the contamination of thermal emission from the Galactic interstellar dust. The MKID arrays (138 MKIDs for 145GHz and 23 MKIDs for 220GHz) were designed and optimized so as to minimize the contamination of the two-level-system noise and maximize the sensitivity. The MKID arrays were successfully installed in May 2023 after the performance verification tests were performed at a laboratory. GroundBIRD has been upgraded to use the full MKID arrays, and scientific observations are now underway. The telescope is automated, so that all observations are performed remotely. Initial validations, including polarization response tests and observations of Jupiter and the moon, have been completed successfully. We are now running scientific observations.         |

|**Abstract**|            Intrinsic colors (ICs) of stars are essential for the studies on both stellar physics and dust reddening. In this work, we developed an XGBoost model to predict the ICs with the atmospheric parameters $T_{\rm eff}$, ${\rm log}\,g$, and $\rm [M/H]$. The model was trained and tested for three colors at Gaia and 2MASS bands with 1,040,446 low-reddening sources. The atmospheric parameters were determined by the Gaia DR3 GSP-phot module and were validated by comparing with APOGEE and LAMOST. We further confirmed that the biases in GSP-phot parameters, especially for $\rm [M/H]$, do not present a significant impact on the IC prediction. The generalization error of the model estimated by the test set is 0.014 mag for $(G_{\rm BP}\,{-}\,G_{\rm RP})_0$, 0.050 mag for $(G_{\rm BP}\,{-}\,K_{\rm S})_0$, and 0.040 mag for $(J\,{-}\,K_{\rm S})_0$. The model was applied to a sample containing 5,714,528 reddened stars with stellar parameters from Andrae et al. (2023) to calculate ICs and reddenings. The high consistency in the comparison of $E(J\,{-}\,K_{\rm S})$ between our results and literature values further validates the accuracy of the XGBoost model. The variation of $E(G_{\rm BP}\,{-}\,K_{\rm S})/E(G_{\rm BP}\,{-}\,G_{\rm RP})$, a representation of the extinction law, with Galactic longitude is found on large scales. This work preliminarily presents the feasibility and the accuracy of the machine-learning approach for IC and dust reddening calculation, whose products could be widely applied to spectro-photometric data. The data sets and trained model can be accessed via \url{this https URL}. The models for more bands will be completed in the following works.         |

|**Abstract**|            Upcoming cosmological surveys have the potential to reach groundbreaking discoveries on multiple fronts, including the neutrino mass, dark energy, and inflation. Most of the key science goals require the joint analysis of datasets from multiple surveys to break parameter degeneracies and calibrate systematics. To realize such analyses, a large set of mock simulations that realistically model correlated observables is required. In this paper we present the N-body component of the HalfDome cosmological simulations, designed for the joint analysis of Stage-IV cosmological surveys, such as Rubin LSST, Euclid, SPHEREx, Roman, DESI, PFS, Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, and LiteBIRD. Our 300TB initial data release includes full-sky lightcones and halo catalogs between $z$=0--4 for 11 fixed cosmology realizations, as well as an additional run with local primordial non-Gaussianity ($f_{\rm NL}$=20). The simulations evolve $6144^3$ particles in a 3.75$\,h^{-1} {\rm Gpc}$ box, reaching a minimum halo mass of $\sim 6 \times 10^{12}\,h^{-1} M_\odot$ and maximum scale of $k \sim 1\,h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.
