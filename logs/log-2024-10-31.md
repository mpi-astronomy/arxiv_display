|**Abstract**|            The first all-sky, high-resolution, 3D map of the optical extinction curve of the Milky Way (Zhang & Green 2024) revealed an unexpected steepening of the extinction curve in the moderate-density, "translucent" interstellar medium (ISM). We argue that this trend is driven by growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) through gas-phase accretion. We find a strong anti-correlation between the slope of the optical extinction curve -- parameterized by $R(V)$ -- and maps of PAH abundance -- parameterized by $q_{\rm PAH}$ -- derived from infrared emission. The range of observed $q_{\rm PAH}$ indicates PAH growth by a factor of $\sim$2 between $A_V \simeq 1$ and 3. This implies a factor-of-two stronger 2175 Angstrom feature, which is sufficient to lower $R(V)$ by the observed amount. This level of PAH growth is possible given rapid accretion timescales and the depletion of carbon in the translucent ISM. Spectral observations by JWST would provide a definitive test of this proposed explanation of $R(V)$ variation.         |

|**Abstract**|            The physical properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) reflect signatures of the underlying gravitational potential, mergers and strong interactions with other halos and satellite galaxies, as well as galactic feedback from supernovae and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Traditionally, clusters have been characterized in terms of summary statistics, such as halo mass, X-ray luminosity, cool-core state, luminosity of AGN, and number of merging components. In this paper of the Extracting Reality from Galaxy Observables with Machine Learning series (ERGO-ML), we instead consider the full information content available in maps of X-ray emission from the ICM. We employ Nearest Neighbour Contrastive Learning (NNCLR) to identify and populate a low-dimensional representation space of such images. Using idealized X-ray maps of the 352 clusters of the TNG-Cluster cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulation suite, we take three orthogonal projections of each cluster at eight snapshots within the redshift range $0\leq z<1$, resulting in a dataset of $\sim$8,000 images. Our findings reveal that this representation space forms a continuous distribution from relaxed to merging objects, and from centrally-peaked to flat emission profiles. The representation also exhibits clear trends with redshift, with halo, gas, stellar, and SMBH mass, with time since a last major merger, and with indicators of dynamical state. We show that an 8-dimensional representation can be used to predict a variety of cluster properties, find analogs, and identify correlations between physical properties, thereby suggesting causal relationships. Our analysis demonstrates that contrastive learning is a powerful tool for characterizing galaxy clusters from their images alone, allowing us to derive constraints on their physical properties and formation histories using cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy simulations.         |

|| G. M. Green, <mark>X. Zhang</mark>, <mark>R. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-10-31*|

|**Abstract**|            The dust extinction curve is typically parameterized by a single variable, R(V), in optical and near-infrared wavelengths. R(V) controls the slope of the extinction-vs.-wavelength curve, and is thought to reflect the grain-size distribution and composition of dust. Low-resolution, flux-calibrated BP/RP spectra from Gaia have allowed the determination of the extinction curve along sightlines to 130 million stars in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. We show that these extinction curves contain more than a single degree of freedom - that is, that they are not simply described by R(V). We identify a number of components that are orthogonal to R(V) variation, and show that these components vary across the sky in coherent patterns that resemble interstellar medium structure. These components encode variation in the 770 nm extinction feature, intermediate-scale and very broad structure, and a newly identified feature at 850 nm, and likely trace both dust composition and local conditions in the interstellar medium. Correlations of the 770 nm and 850 nm features with R(V) suggest that their carriers become more abundant as the carrier of the 2175 Angstrom feature is destroyed. Our 24 million extinction-curve decompositions and feature equivalent-width measurements are publicly available at this https URL.         |
