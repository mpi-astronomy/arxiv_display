|**Abstract**|            Dark matter is believed to account for a significant portion of the mass in the universe, exerting a critical influence on the formation and evolution of cosmic structures. This research delves into the processes of annihilation and decay of dark matter particles, which generate observable signals that deepen our comprehension of their characteristics and behaviors. Furthermore, the study explores the potential role of primordial black holes, with a focus on the emissions of Hawking radiation that could offer valuable insights into their distribution and size range. A key aspect of this investigation revolves around the 21 cm signal, a vital tool for scrutinizing the effects of dark matter particles and primordial black hole phenomena on the intergalactic medium. The upcoming Hongmeng mission, featuring a lunar orbital interferometer array, is poised to revolutionize our ability to observe the 21 cm signal. By conducting measurements devoid of atmospheric disturbances, the mission will significantly boost sensitivity to subtle signals associated with dark matter particle annihilation, decay, and primordial black hole emissions. This study assesses the expected performance of the Hongmeng mission in detecting these telltale signs and aims to unveil fresh insights into the nature and interactions of dark matter particles and primordial black hole emissions through a meticulous analysis of the global 21 cm spectrum. The mission holds immense promise for reshaping our understanding of the universe's concealed components.         |
