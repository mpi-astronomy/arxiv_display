|**Abstract**|            Context. Edge-on disks offer a unique opportunity to directly examine their vertical structure, providing valuable insights into planet formation processes. We investigate the dust properties, as well as the CO and HCO$^+$ gas properties, in the edge-on disk surrounding the T Tauri star 2MASS J04202144+281349 (SSTTau042021). Aims. We estimate the radial and vertical temperature and density profile for the gas and the dust. Methods. We use ALMA archival data of CO isotopologues and continuum emission at 2, 1.3 and 0.9 mm together with new NOEMA HCO$^+$ 3-2 observations. We retrieve the gas and dust disk properties using the tomographic method and the \textsc{DiskFit} model. Results. The vertical CO emission appears very extended, partly tracing the H$_2$ wind observed by JWST. C$^{18}$O, $^{13}$CO and HCO$^+$ emission characterize the bulk of the molecular layer. The dust and gas have a mid-plane temperatures of $\sim 7-11$ K. The temperature of the molecular layer (derived from $^{13}$CO and HCO$^+$) is on the order of 16 K. HCO$^+$ 3-2 being thermalized, we derive a lower limit for the H$_2$ volume density of $\sim 3 \times 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ at radius 100-200 au between 1 and 2 scale heights. The atmosphere temperature of the CO gas is of the order $\sim$ 31 K at a radius of 100 au. We directly observe CO and HCO$^+$ gas onto the mid-plane beyond the dust outer radius ($\ge 300$ au). The (gas+dust) disk mass estimated up to a radius of 300 au is on the order of $4.6 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{M}_\odot$. Conclusions. Thanks to the favorable disk inclination, we present the first quantitative evidence for vertical molecular stratification with direct observation of CO and HCO$^+$ gas along the mid-plane. We estimate the temperature profile with temperature of 7-11 K near the mid-plane, and 15-20 K in the dense part of the molecular layer up to $\sim$ 35 K above.         |

|**Abstract**|            This is the second paper in the HOWLS (higher-order weak lensing statistics) series exploring the usage of non-Gaussian statistics for cosmology inference within \textit{Euclid}. With respect to our first paper, we develop a full tomographic analysis based on realistic photometric redshifts which allows us to derive Fisher forecasts in the ($\sigma_8$, $w_0$) plane for a \textit{Euclid}-like data release 1 (DR1) setup. We find that the 5 higher-order statistics (HOSs) that satisfy the Gaussian likelihood assumption of the Fisher formalism (1-point probability distribution function, $\ell$1-norm, peak counts, Minkowski functionals, and Betti numbers) each outperform the shear 2-point correlation functions by a factor $2.5$ on the $w_0$ forecasts, with only marginal improvement when used in combination with 2-point estimators, suggesting that every HOS is able to retrieve both the non-Gaussian and Gaussian information of the matter density field. The similar performance of the different estimators\inlinecomment{, with a slight preference for Minkowski functionals and 1-point probability distribution function,} is explained by a homogeneous use of multi-scale and tomographic information, optimized to lower computational costs. These results hold for the $3$ mass mapping techniques of the \textit{Euclid} pipeline: aperture mass, Kaiser--Squires, and Kaiser--Squires plus, and are unaffected by the application of realistic star masks. Finally, we explore the use of HOSs with the Bernardeau--Nishimichi--Taruya (BNT) nulling scheme approach, finding promising results towards applying physical scale cuts to HOSs.         |

|**Abstract**|            Here we use data from multi-scale galactic MHD simulations to observe filaments and star forming clumps on 10's of pc scales and investigate flow rate relationships along, and onto filaments as well as flows towards the clumps. Using the FilFinderPPV identification technique, we identify the prominent filamentary structures in each data cube. Each filament and its corresponding clump are analysed by calculating flow rates along each filament towards the clump, onto each filament from increasing distances, and radially around each clump. This analysis is conducted for two cubes, one feedback dominated region, and one with less feedback. Looking at the face-on inclination of the simulations (0 degrees), we observe different trends depending on the environmental conditions (more or less feedback). The median flow rate in the region with more feedback is 8.9$\times$10$^{-5}$ M$_{sun}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and we see that flow rates along the filaments toward the clumps generally decrease in these regions. In the region with less feedback we have a median flow rate of 2.9$\times$10$^{-4}$ M$_{sun}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and when looking along the filaments here we see the values either increase or remain constant. We find that the flow rates from the environments onto the primary filaments are of an order of magnitude sufficient to sustain the flow rates along these filaments. When discussing the effects of galactic and filamentary inclination, we also observe that viewing the filaments from different galactic inclinations can reveal the presence of feeder structures (smaller filamentary structures aiding in the flow of material). The method used to estimate these flow rates, which has been previously applied to observational data, produced results consistent with those obtained from the simulations themselves, providing high confidence in the flow rate calculation method.         |

|**Abstract**|            The CCAT Observatory is a ground-based submillimeter to millimeter experiment located on Cerro Chajnantor in the Atacama Desert, at an altitude of 5,600 meters. CCAT features the 6-meter Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), which will cover frequency bands from 210 GHz to 850 GHz using its first-generation science instrument, Prime-Cam. The detectors used in Prime-Cam are feedhorn-coupled, lumped-element superconducting microwave kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). The telescope will perform wide-area surveys at speeds on the order of degrees per second. During telescope operation, the KIDs are exposed to changes in the magnetic field caused by the telescope's movement through Earth's magnetic field and internal sources within the telescope. We present and compare measurements of the magnetic sensitivity of three different CCAT KID designs at 100 mK. The measurements are conducted in a dilution refrigerator (DR) with a set of room temperature Helmholtz coils positioned around the DR. We discuss the implications of these results for CCAT field operations.         |

|**Abstract**|            Aims. We have determined Sr abundance in a sample of 31 red giant branch stars located in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc with the aim to identify potential differences in the Sr abundance between first population (1P, Na-poor) and second population (2P, Na-rich) stars. Methods. We derived the Na and Sr abundances from the archival spectra obtained with the UVES spectrograph. To do this, we used 1D ATLAS9 model atmospheres and a 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral synthesis method. Particular attention was paid to assessing the potential impact of CN line blending on the obtained Sr abundances. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential influence of convection on the Sr line formation by using 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres computed with the CO5BOLD code. Results. Our results suggest a weak correlation between the abundances of Sr and Na. Together with a similar correlation between the abundances of Zr and Na determined in our previous study, our analysis of Sr suggests that polluters that have enriched 2P stars with light elements may have produced some s-process elements as well. The mean Sr abundance determined in 31 red giant branch stars of 47~Tuc is $\langle {\rm [Sr/Fe]} \rangle = 0.18\pm0.08$ (the error denotes the standard deviation due to the star-to-star abundance scatter). This value is within the range of the Sr abundance variation that is observed in Galactic field stars of similar metallicity. The mean [Sr/Zr] abundance ratio in our sample stars suggests that the two s-process elements could have been synthesized by either low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars ($M=1-4 {\rm M}_{\odot}$) or massive ($M=10-20 {\rm M}_{\odot}$) fast-rotating ($v_{\rm rot}=200-300$ km/s) stars.         |

|**Abstract**|            LTT-9779 b is an ultra-hot Neptune (Rp ~ 4.7 Re, Mp ~ 29 Me) orbiting its Sun-like host star in just 19 hours, placing it deep within the "hot Neptune desert," where Neptunian planets are seldom found. We present new JWST NIRSpec G395H phase-curve observations that probe its atmospheric composition in unprecedented detail. At near-infrared wavelengths, which penetrate the high-altitude clouds inferred from previous NIRISS/SOSS spectra, thermal emission reveals a carbon-rich atmosphere with opacity dominated by carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Both species are detected at all orbital phases, with retrieved mixing ratios of 10^-1 for CO and 10^-4 for CO2, indicating a globally well-mixed reservoir of carbon-bearing gases. We also moderately detect water vapor (H2O) and tentatively detect sulfur dioxide (SO2), providing insight into its chemistry and possible photochemical production under intense stellar irradiation. From these detections we infer a carbon-to-oxygen ratio near unity (C/O ~ 1) and a metallicity exceeding 500X Solar, consistent with equilibrium chemistry predictions for high-temperature atmospheres. This enrichment raises the mean molecular weight, reducing atmospheric escape, and likely helps LTT-9779 b retain a substantial atmosphere despite extreme irradiation. Our findings show that LTT-9779 b survives where few planets can, maintaining a carbon-rich atmosphere in a region where hot Neptune-class worlds are expected to evaporate. This makes LTT-9779 b a valuable laboratory for studying atmospheric escape and chemical processes under extreme conditions, offering new insight into the survival of planets in the hot Neptune desert.         |
