|**Abstract**| Given the massive spectroscopic surveys and the Gaia mission, the Milky Way has turned into a unique laboratory to be explored using abundance ratios that show a strong dependency with time. Within this framework, the data provided through asteroseismology serve as a valuable complement. Yet, it has been demonstrated that chemical traits can not be used as universal relations across the Galaxy. To complete this picture, it is important to investigate the dependence on metallicity of the chemical ratios employed for inferring stellar ages. We aim to explore different combinations of neutron-capture, odd-Z and $\alpha$ elements as a function of age, particularly focusing on their metallicity dependence for a sample of 74 giant field stars. Using UVES observations, we derive atmospheric parameters and high-precision line by line chemical abundances (<0.04 dex) for the entire set of spectra. Stellar ages are inferred from astereoseismic information. By fitting chemical-age trends for three different metallicity groups, we estimated their dependence on metallicity. We found that the stronger chemical-age relations ([Zr/$\alpha$]) are not necessarily the ratios with the smaller dependence on metallicity ([Ce/$\alpha$] and [Ce/Eu]). We confirm the [n-capture/$\alpha$]-age trends for evolved stars, wherein the most significant correlation is evident in stars with solar-metallicity, gradually diminishing in stars with lower iron content. The lack of homogeneity within the metallicity range highlights the intricate nature of our Galaxy's star formation history and yield production. Metallicity dependence in s-process element yields and the impact of radial stellar migration challenge the reliability of using chemical abundances alone to date stars. These discoveries raise doubts about universally valid chemical clocks applicable across the entire Galaxy and its diverse metallicity ranges. |

|**Abstract**| Utilizing astrometric parameters sourced from \textit{Gaia} Data Release 3 and radial velocities obtained from various spectroscopic surveys, we identify 519 high-velocity stars (HiVels) with a total velocity in the Galactocentric restframe greater than 70\% of their local escape velocity under the {\tt\string Gala} {\tt\string MilkyWayPotential}. Our analysis reveals that the majority of these HiVels are metal-poor late-type giants, and we show 9 HiVels that are unbound candidates to the Galaxy with escape probabilities of 50\%. To investigate the origins of these HiVels, we classify them into four categories and consider the impact of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) potential on their backward-integration trajectories. Specifically, we find that one of the HiVels can track back to the Galactic Center, and three HiVels may originate from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph). Furthermore, some HiVels appear to be ejected from the Galactic disk, while others formed within the Milky Way or have an extragalactic origin. Given that the LMC has a significant impact on the orbits of Sgr dSph, we examine the reported HiVels that originate from the Sgr dSph, with a few of them passing within the half-light radius of the Sgr dSph. |
