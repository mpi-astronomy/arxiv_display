|**Abstract**|            The existence of billion-solar-mass black holes hosted in luminous quasars within the first gigayear of cosmic history poses a challenge to our understanding of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. The problem is further exacerbated by the very short quasar lifetimes of $t_{\rm Q}\lesssim 10^6$ years, as derived from the extent of their proximity zone (PZ) sizes observed in the quasars' rest-UV spectra. However, the quasar lifetime estimates based on the extents of the proximity zones may be underestimated, as time-variable obscuration effects might have limited the quasars' emission along our sightline in the past. In this work, we present independent quasar lifetime measurements for six quasars at $z \sim 6$ leveraging the extended nebular emission perpendicular to our line-of-sight. We use observations from the Very Large Telescope/Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) to search for extended Ly$\alpha$ emission in the circumgalactic medium around quasars with small proximity zones and estimate their lifetimes as the light travel time between the SMBH and the outer edge of the nebula. We find agreement between the independent lifetime estimates. For one object we find a proximate absorption system prematurely truncating the extent of the quasar's proximity zone, which thus results in an expected discrepancy between the lifetime estimates. Our results provide further evidence that the quasars' current accretion episode has only recently begun, challenging our models of SMBH growth.         |

|**Abstract**|            Planet formation via core accretion involves the growth of solids that can accumulate to form planetary cores. There are a number of barriers to the collisional growth of solids in protostellar discs, one of which is the drift, or metre, barrier. Solid particles experience a drag force that will tend to cause them to drift towards the central star in smooth, laminar discs, potentially removing particles before they grow large enough to decouple from the disc gas. Here we present 3-dimensional, shearing box simulations that explore the dynamical evolution of solids in a protostellar disc that is massive enough for the gravitational instability to manifest as spiral density waves. We expand on earlier work by considering a range of particle sizes and find that the spirals can still enhance the local solid density by more than an order of magnitude, potentially aiding grain growth. Furthermore, if solid particles have enough mass, and the particle size distribution extends to sufficiently large particle sizes, the solid component of the disc can undergo direct gravitational collapse to form bound clumps with masses typically between $1$ and $10$ M$_\oplus$. Thus, the concentration of dust in a self-gravitating disc could bypass the size barrier for collisional growth and directly form planetary cores early in the lifetime of the disc.         |
