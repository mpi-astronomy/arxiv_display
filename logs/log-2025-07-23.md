|**Abstract**|            The extended main-sequence turn-off (eMSTO) is a well-known feature observed in young and intermediate-age star clusters, characterized by a significant broadening of the main-sequence turn-off region. Although prolonged star formation and stellar rotation have been proposed as possible explanations, no consensus has yet been reached. Most previous studies have focused on high-mass clusters. In this work, we extend the analysis to the less-explored low-mass regime by investigating star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds using data from the VISCACHA survey. We employed a widely used method to quantify the MSTO width in terms of age spread. Additionally, to validate our approach, we used a cluster also observed with HST. Our analysis confirms that the eMSTO phenomenon is also present in low-mass clusters, following the known age/mass-MSTO width relations. In particular, the less massive cluster in our sample does not show an eMSTO, supporting the proposed link between the eMSTO and the escape velocity of the cluster, providing a new lower limit to the age spread of $88\pm40$ Myr for the presence of the eMSTO. The consistent MSTO width measurements between the VISCACHA and HST photometries confirm the robustness of our method and demonstrate that the age spread determination is independent of the photometric system, showing also the power of ground-based observations to investigate the eMSTO phenomenon.         |

|**Abstract**|            Star formation is a hierarchical process ranging from molecular clouds down to individual protostars. In particular how infalling asymmetric structures, called streamers, delivering new material onto protostellar systems, are connected to the surrounding envelope is not understood. We investigate the connection between the cloud material at 10000 au scales down to 300 au scales towards L1448N in the Perseus star-forming region hosting three young Class 0/I protostellar systems. Sensitive molecular line observations taken with the IRAM 30m telescope and NOEMA at 1.4 mm are used to study the kinematic properties in the region traced by the molecular lines. Several infalling streamers are associated with the protostellar systems, some of them traced by C18O and DCN, while one of them is bright in SO and SO2. The kinematic properties of the former streamers are consistent with the velocities observed at large envelope scales of 10000 au, while the latter case show different kinematics. The masses and infall rates of the streamers are 0.01 Msun and 0.01-0.1 Msun and 10^-6 Msun/yr and 5-18x10^-6 Msun/yr for IRS3A and IRS3C, respectively. The envelope mass in the L1448N region is ~16Msun, thus the mass of a single streamer is low compared to the envelope mass (<1%). However, compared to the estimated mass of the protostellar systems a single streamer could deliver up to 1% and 8-17% of mass towards IRS3A (M*~1.2 Msun) and IRS3C (M*~1 Msun), respectively. The rotational signatures of structures in L1448N are all connected - from the large-scale envelope, infalling streamers, down to the rotation of all three disks. Two of the three Class 0/I protostellar systems are still fed by this surrounding material, which can be associated to the remnant envelope. However, we also find a streamer that is bright in SO and SO2 towards IRS3C that could be connected to a nearby sulfur reservoir.         |

|**Abstract**|            The dominant formation channel of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) has been extensively studied for many years. Several hypervelocity white dwarfs (HVWDs) with space velocities of $\gtrsim 1000\,\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$ have recently been discovered. One possible origin of these stars is the dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation (D6) scenario, in which an accreting sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen (CO) WD detonates as a SN Ia. In this scenario, the less massive WD may survive its companion's detonation and be ejected as a HVWD. Most of the observed HVWDs are hotter and puffier than normal WDs, perhaps due to their recent proximity to a SN. In this work, we test whether these properties can be explained by long-lived stable carbon (C) burning in the interiors of CO WD donors triggered by a SN shock. We model the long-term evolution of CO WDs following rapid energy injection using 1D models. We find that stable C burning can be ignited in CO WDs with masses of $0.95 - 1.10\,M_{\odot}$ if SN energy penetrates sufficiently deeply. The resulting born-again stars settle on the C-burning main sequence while they convert their interiors from C and O to Ne and Mg, where they have temperatures and radii similar to some of the observed HVWDs. However, the timescale over which C-burning WDs remain inflated is $\lesssim 10^5\,$yr, which is at least an order of magnitude shorter than the kinematic ages of observed hot HVWDs. We conclude that observed HVWDs are unlikely to be inflated by C burning. The stellar evolution of observed HVWDs remains an open problem.         |

|**Abstract**|            Compact, low-mass galaxies with strong nebular emission are considered promising candidates for efficient ionizing photon production and escape. We present a spatially resolved analysis of 189 galaxies at redshifts $z \sim 6.7-7.6$ in JADES GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields and selected via JWST/NIRCam F410M filter. By employing annular photometry and spectral energy distribution fitting across rest-frame UV to optical wavelengths, we investigate the internal structure of star formation, ionizing photon production and escape, as well as the resolved star formation histories within these galaxies. We find that these galaxies exhibit compact, centrally concentrated, and bursty star formation, especially in lower-mass systems ($\log(M_*/{\rm M_{\odot}}) <9.0$). The central regions of them display extreme [OIII]+H$\beta$ equivalent widths ($>$1000 Å), high ionizing photon production efficiencies ($\xi_{\text{ion}} \sim 10^{25.6}$ Hz erg$^{-1}$), steep UV slopes ($\sim -2.3$), and elevated escape fractions ($f_{\text{esc}} > 0.08$), with all these properties peaking in the inner regions. These findings reveal outside-in growth and rising star formation histories at $z\sim 7$, with the central regions of them playing a pivotal role in driving cosmic reionization.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-23*|

|**Abstract**|            We extend our super-resolution and emulation framework for cosmological dark matter simulations to include hydrodynamics. We present a two-stage deep learning model to emulate high-resolution (HR-HydroSim) baryonic fields from low-resolution (LR-HydroSim) simulations at redshift $z = 3$. The method takes as inputs an LR-HydroSim and the high-resolution initial conditions (HR-HydroICs). First, the model stochastically generates high-resolution baryonic fields from the LR-HydroSim. Second, a deterministic emulator refines these fields using HR-HydroICs to reconstruct small-scale structures including displacement, velocity, internal energy, and gas/star classification. Trained on paired low- and high-resolution simulations produced with \texttt{MP-Gadget}, the model captures small-scale structures of the intergalactic medium and %Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observables down to the 100 kpc pressure smoothing scale relevant to the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. The model achieves subpercent error for overdensity, temperature, velocity, and optical depth fields, a mean relative error of 1.07\% in the large-scale flux power spectrum (\(k < 3 \times 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{s/km}\)), and less than 10\% error in the flux probability distribution function. Notably, the two-stage model reduces the compute time by a factor of $\sim$450 compared to full smoothed particle hydrodynamics at the same resolution. This work demonstrates the potential of this framework as a powerful and efficient tool for generating high-resolution fields offering fast and accurate alternatives to traditional cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and enabling large-volume mock datasets for next-generation cosmological surveys.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Lunar Orbital VLBI Experiment (LOVEX) is a scientific component of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Project (CLEP) Chang'E-7. The spaceborne component of LOVEX is implemented onboard the relay satellite QueQiao-2, which was launched on 2024 March 20, and later placed into an elliptical selenocentric orbit. The LOVEX-specific payload consists of an X-band cryogenic receiver, a hydrogen maser frequency standard, and VLBI data formatting and acquisition electronics. Several components of the QueQiao-2 nominal onboard instrumentation, such as the 4.2-meter antenna, the data storage device, and the downlink communication system, contribute to the overall spaceborne VLBI instrumentation. This allows us to form a space radio telescope capable of co-observing with Earth-based radio telescopes in VLBI mode. In this space VLBI system, the length of the baseline extends up to approximately 380,000 km. This paper presents the LOVEX scientific objectives, architecture, instrumentation, pre-launch tests, in-flight verification and calibration, and the first in-flight detections of interferometric response (''fringes'') achieved through observations of the quasar AO 0235+164 and the Chang'E-6 orbital module, positioned at the Sun-Earth Lagrange point L2. These initial results demonstrate the successful performance of LOVEX, verifying its capability for both astronomical and spacecraft tracking observations at ultra-long VLBI baselines.         |

|**Abstract**|            Neutrinos and dark energy (DE) have entered a new era of investigation, as the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation measurements tighten the constraints on the neutrino mass and suggest that DE may be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of simultaneously incorporating $\sum m_\nu$ and $N_{\rm eff}$ within the framework of dynamical DE. A joint analysis of DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background, DESY5 supernova, and DESY1 weak lensing data yields a total neutrino mass of $\sum m_\nu = 0.098^{+0.016}_{-0.037}\,\mathrm{eV}$, indicating a preference for a positive neutrino mass at the $2.7\sigma$ level within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. This work highlights the important influence of the strength of evidence for dynamically evolving DE on the measurement of neutrino mass, with stronger evidence for DE dynamics leading to a larger neutrino mass. These results underscore the importance of measuring the neutrino mass within the framework of dynamical DE, particularly in light of the forthcoming, more complete DESI data releases.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report new spectroscopic and interferometric observations of the Pleiades binary star Atlas, which played an important role nearly three decades ago in settling the debate over the distance to the cluster from ground-based and space-based determinations. We use the new measurements, together with other published and archival astrometric observations, to improve the determination of the 291-day orbit and the distance to Atlas ($136.2 \pm 1.4$ pc). We also derive the main properties of the components, including their absolute masses ($5.04 \pm 0.17 M_{\odot}$ and $3.64 \pm 0.12 M_{\odot}$), sizes, effective temperatures, projected rotational velocities, and chemical composition. We find that the more evolved primary star is rotationally distorted, and are able to estimate its oblateness and the approximate orientation of its spin axis from the interferometric observations. The spin axis may well be aligned with the orbital axis. Models of stellar evolution from MESA that account for rotation provide a good match to all of the primary's global properties, and point to an initial angular rotation rate on the zero-age main sequence of about 55% of the breakup velocity. The current location of the star in the H-R diagram is near the very end of the hydrogen-burning main sequence, at an age of about 105 Myr, according to these models. Our spectroscopic analysis of the more slowly-rotating secondary indicates that it is a helium-weak star, with other chemical anomalies.         |
