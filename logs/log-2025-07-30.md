|**Abstract**|            We present and discuss optical emission line properties obtained from the analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra for an X-ray selected sample of 3684 galaxies (0.002 < z < 0.55), drawn from the eRASS1 catalog. We modeled SDSS-V DR19 spectra using the NBursts full spectrum fitting technique with E-MILES simple stellar populations (SSP) models and emission line templates to decompose broad and narrow emission line components for correlation with X-ray properties. We place the galaxies on the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram to diagnose their dominant excitation mechanism. We show that the consistent use of the narrow component fluxes shifts most galaxies systematically and significantly upward to the active galactic nuclei (AGN) region on the BPT diagram. On this basis, we confirm the dependence between a galaxys position on the BPT diagram and its (0.2-2.3 keV) X-ray/H$\alpha$ flux ratio. We also verified the correlation between X-ray luminosity and emission line luminosities of the narrow [O\iii]$\lambda 5007$ and broad H$\alpha$ component; as well as the relations between the Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) mass, the X-ray luminosity, and the velocity dispersion of the stellar component ($\sigma_{*}$) on the base on the unique sample of optical spectroscopic follow-up of X-ray sources detected by eROSITA. These results highlight the importance of emission line decomposition in AGN classification and refine the connection between X-ray emission and optical emission line properties in galaxies.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present maps of the mean metallicity distributions on the Galactocentric $R$--$Z$ plane at different azimuthal angles using red clump stars selected from the LAMOST and APOGEE surveys. In the inner disk ($R < $ 11\,kpc), the metallicity distribution is symmetric between the upper and lower disk. However, we find a North-South metallicity asymmetry in the outer disk ($R > 11$\,kpc), especially towards the anti-Galactic center ($-5^\circ < \Phi < 15^\circ$) direction. By further dissecting the map in age space, we detect this asymmetry across all mono-age stellar populations. However, the asymmetry is less pronounced in older populations ($\tau > 8$ Gyr) compared to younger ones ($\tau < 6$\,Gyr). This reduced significance likely stems from three factors: larger age uncertainties, fewer stars in the outer disk, and the kinematically hotter nature of older populations. The observed metallicity asymmetry may be the consequence of the purturbation of the recent pericentric passage through the Galactic disk and tidal force of the well-known Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.         |

|**Abstract**|            Solar active regions are where sunspots are located and photospheric magnetic fluxes are concentrated, therefore being the sources of energetic eruptions in the solar atmosphere. The detection and statistics of solar active regions have been forefront topics in solar physics. In this study, we developed a solar active region detector (SARD) based on the advanced object detection model YOLOv8. First, we applied image processing techniques including thresholding and morphological operations to 6975 line-of-sight magnetograms from 2010 to 2019 at a cadence of 12~h, obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory. With manual refinement, we labeled 26531 active regions in the dataset for further training and test with the detection model. Without any overlap between the training and test sets, the superior performance of SARD is demonstrated by an average precision rate as high as 94\%. We then performed a statistical analysis on the area and magnetic flux of the detected active regions, both of which yield log-normal distributions. This result sheds light on the underlying complexity and multi-scale nature of solar active regions.         |

|**Abstract**|            Axion-like particles (ALPs) provide a compelling avenue for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. In astrophysical magnetized plasmas an ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ induces energy-dependent oscillations in the photon survival probability that imprint modulations on emission spectra. X-ray observations of bright spectrally-smooth sources can provide particularly sensitive probes of ultralight ALPs with masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV due to long propagation distances, strong magnetic fields and high photon statistics. We present a comprehensive forecast of ALP-photon conversion in three representative systems: (i) background active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed through foreground intracluster magnetic fields, (ii) central AGNs within their host cluster halos and (iii) Galactic X-ray binaries viewed through the Milky Way field. Using detailed simulations we assess the prospective sensitivity of high-resolution X-ray missions including XRISM, Athena, and Arcus. For typical magnetic field configurations a 5 Ms XRISM observation of the Perseus Cluster AGN NGC 1275 can reach down to $g_{a\gamma} \sim 3 \times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at $m_a \lesssim 10^{-12}$ eV, while Athena's superior energy resolution improves this reach by a factor of $\sim 3$. We quantify the impact of magnetic field modeling, photon statistics, and spectral binning strategies. Our results demonstrate the scientific potential of high-resolution X-ray observations to probe photon-ALP coupling in previously inaccessible parameter space, offering a powerful window into physics beyond the Standard Model.         |
