|**Abstract**| The vector Apodizing Phase Plate (vAPP) is a pupil plane coronagraph that suppresses starlight by forming a dark hole in its point spread function (PSF). The unconventional and non-axisymmetrical PSF arising from the phase modification applied by this coronagraph presents a special challenge to post-processing techniques. We aim to implement a recently developed post-processing algorithm, temporal reference analysis of planets (TRAP) on vAPP coronagraphic data. The property of TRAP that uses non-local training pixels, combined with the unconventional PSF of vAPP, allows for more flexibility than previous spatial algorithms in selecting reference pixels to model systematic noise. Datasets from two types of vAPPs are analysed: a double grating-vAPP (dgvAPP360) that produces a single symmetric PSF and a grating-vAPP (gvAPP180) that produces two D-shaped PSFs. We explore how to choose reference pixels to build temporal systematic noise models in TRAP for them. We then compare the performance of TRAP with previously implemented algorithms that produced the best signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in companion detections in these datasets. We find that the systematic noise between the two D-shaped PSFs is not as temporally associated as expected. Conversely, there is still a significant number of systematic noise sources that are shared by the dark hole and the bright side in the same PSF. We should choose reference pixels from the same PSF when reducing the dgvAPP360 dataset or the gvAPP180 dataset with TRAP. In these datasets, TRAP achieves results consistent with previous best detections, with an improved S/N for the gvAPP180 dataset. |

|**Abstract**| We present follow-up spectroscopy of 21 cataclysmic variables (CVs) with evolved secondaries and ongoing or recently-terminated mass transfer. Evolutionary models predict that the secondaries should have anomalous surface abundances owing to nuclear burning in their cores during their main-sequence evolution and subsequent envelope stripping by their companion white dwarfs. To test these models, we measure sodium (Na) abundances of the donors from the Fraunhofer "D" doublet. Accounting for interstellar absorption, we find that {\it all} objects in our sample have enhanced Na abundances. We measure 0.3 $\lesssim$ [Na/H] $\lesssim$ 1.5 dex across the sample, with a median [Na/H] = 0.956 dex, i.e., about an order of magnitude enhancement over solar values. To interpret these values, we run MESA binary evolution models of CVs in which mass transfer begins just as the donor leaves the main sequence. These generically predict Na enhancement in donors with initial donor masses $\gtrsim 1\,M_{\odot}$, consistent with our observations. In the models, Na enrichment occurs in the donors' cores via the NeNa cycle near the end of their main-sequence evolution. Na-enhanced material is exposed when the binaries reach orbital periods of a few hours. Donors with higher initial masses are predicted to have higher Na abundances at fixed orbital period owing to their higher core temperatures during main-sequence evolution. The observed [Na/H] values are on average $\approx$0.3 dex higher than predicted by the models. Surface abundances of evolved CV donors provide a unique opportunity to study nuclear burning products in the cores of intermediate-mass stars. |
