|**Abstract**| Aims: At intermediate redshift, galaxy groups/clusters are thought to impact galaxies (e.g. their angular momentum). We investigate whether the environment has an impact on the galaxies' angular momentum and identify underlying driving physical mechanisms. Methods: We derive robust estimates of the stellar angular momentum using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images combined with spatially resolved ionised gas kinematics from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) for a sample of ~200 galaxies in groups and in the field at z~0.7 drawn from the MAGIC survey. Using various environmental tracers, we study the position of the galaxies in the the angular momentum-stellar mass (Fall) relation as a function of environment. Results: We measure a 0.12 dex (2sigma significant) depletion of angular momentum for low-mass galaxies (M* < 10^10 Msun) in groups with respect to the field. Massive galaxies located in dense environments have less angular momentum than expected from the low-mass Fall relation but, without a comparable field sample, we cannot infer whether this effect is mass- or environmentally-driven. Furthermore, massive galaxies are found in the centre of the structures and have low systemic velocities. The observed depletion of angular momentum at low mass does not appear linked with the strength of the over-density around the galaxies but it is strongly correlated with the galaxies' systemic velocity normalised by the dispersion of their host group and with their ionised gas velocity dispersion. Conclusions: Group galaxies seem depleted in angular momentum, especially at low mass. Our results suggest that this depletion might be induced by physical mechanisms that scale with the systemic velocity of the galaxies (e.g. stripping or merging) and that such mechanism might be responsible for enhancing the velocity dispersion of the gas as galaxies lose angular momentum. |

|**Abstract**| Context. The availability of large bandwidth receivers for millimeter radio telescopes allows the acquisition of position-position-frequency data cubes over a wide field of view and a broad frequency coverage. These cubes contain much information on the physical, chemical, and kinematical properties of the emitting gas. However, their large size coupled with inhomogenous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are major challenges for consistent analysis and interpretation.Aims. We search for a denoising method of the low SNR regions of the studied data cubes that would allow to recover the low SNR emission without distorting the signals with high SNR.Methods. We perform an in-depth data analysis of the 13 CO and C 17 O (1 -- 0) data cubes obtained as part of the ORION-B large program performed at the IRAM 30m telescope. We analyse the statistical properties of the noise and the evolution of the correlation of the signal in a given frequency channel with that of the adjacent channels. This allows us to propose significant improvements of typical autoassociative neural networks, often used to denoise hyperspectral Earth remote sensing data. Applying this method to the 13 CO (1 -- 0) cube, we compare the denoised data with those derived with the multiple Gaussian fitting algorithm ROHSA, considered as the state of the art procedure for data line cubes.Results. The nature of astronomical spectral data cubes is distinct from that of the hyperspectral data usually studied in the Earth remote sensing literature because the observed intensities become statistically independent beyond a short channel separation. This lack of redundancy in data has led us to adapt the method, notably by taking into account the sparsity of the signal along the spectral axis. The application of the proposed algorithm leads to an increase of the SNR in voxels with weak signal, while preserving the spectral shape of the data in high SNR voxels.Conclusions. The proposed algorithm that combines a detailed analysis of the noise statistics with an innovative autoencoder architecture is a promising path to denoise radio-astronomy line data cubes. In the future, exploring whether a better use of the spatial correlations of the noise may further improve the denoising performances seems a promising avenue. In addition, |

|| M. S. Delos, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-07-26*|
|*Comments*| *11 pages, 10 figures*|
|**Abstract**| Recent studies indicate that thermally produced dark matter will form highly concentrated, low-mass cusps in the early universe that often survive until the present. While these cusps contain a small fraction of the dark matter, their high density significantly increases the expected gamma-ray flux from dark matter annihilation, particularly in searches of large angular regions. We utilize 14 years of Fermi-LAT data to set strong constraints on dark matter annihilation through a detailed study of the isotropic gamma-ray background, excluding with 95% confidence dark matter annihilation to $b\bar{b}$ final states for dark matter masses below 120 GeV. |

|| Y.-H. Ryu, et al. -- incl., <mark>A. Gould</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-07-26*|
|*Comments*| *67 pages, 13 figures, 16 tables*|
|**Abstract**| We complete the analysis of planetary candidates found by the KMT AnomalyFinder for the 2017 prime fields that cover $\sim 13\,{\rm deg}^2$. We report 3 unambiguous planets: OGLE-2017-BLG-0640, OGLE-2017-BLG-1275, and OGLE-2017-BLG-1237. The first two of these were not previously identified, while the last was not previously published due to technical complications induced by a nearby variable. We further report that a fourth anomalous event, the previously recognized OGLE-2017-BLG-1777, is very likely to be planetary, although its light curve requires unusually complex modeling because the lens and source both have orbiting companions. One of the 3 unambiguous planets, OGLE-2017-BLG-1275 is the first AnomalyFinder discovery that has a {\it Spitzer} microlens parallax measurement, $\pi_E \sim 0.045\pm0.015$, implying that this planetary system almost certainly lies in the Galactic bulge. In the order listed, the four planetary events have planet-host mass ratios $q$, and normalized projected separations $s$, of $(\log q,s)$ = $(-2.31,0.61)$, $(-2.06,0.63/1.09)$, $(-2.10,1.04)$, and $(-2.86,0.72)$. Combined with previously published events, the 2017 AnomalyFinder prime fields contain 11 unambiguous planets with well-measured $q$ and one very likely candidate, of which 3 are AnomalyFinder discoveries. In addition to these 12, there are three other unambiguous planets with large uncertainties in $q$. |

|**Abstract**| In an earlier work, we demonstrated the effectiveness of Bayesian neural networks in estimating the missing line-of-sight velocities of Gaia stars, and published an accompanying catalogue of blind predictions for the line-of-sight velocities of stars in Gaia DR3. These were not merely point predictions, but probability distributions reflecting our state of knowledge about each star. Here, we verify that these predictions were highly accurate: the DR3 measurements were statistically consistent with our prediction distributions, with an approximate error rate of 1.5%. We use this same technique to produce a publicly available catalogue of predictive probability distributions for the 185 million stars up to a G-band magnitude of 17.5 still missing line-of-sight velocities in Gaia DR3. Validation tests demonstrate that the predictions are reliable for stars within approximately 7 kpc from the Sun and with distance precisions better than around 20%. For such stars, the typical prediction uncertainty is 25-30 km/s. We invite the community to use these radial velocities in analyses of stellar kinematics and dynamics, and give an example of such an application. |

|**Abstract**| Strong evidence for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) has been reported in the nano-Hertz band. Interpreting the origin of this background to be scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), we explore the equation of state (EoS) of the early universe by performing Bayes parameter inferences across the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), cosmic microwave background (CMB), and pulsar timing array (PTA) joint observations for the first time. Assuming a monochromatic power spectrum for primordial curvature perturbations, we obtain the spectral amplitude $A\sim10^{-3}-10^{-1}$ and spectral peak frequency $f_\ast\sim10^{-7}-10^{-6}$ Hz. We find that the radiation domination with EoS $w=1/3$ is compatible with the current observational data, the kination domination with EoS $w=1$ is not forbidden, while the early matter domination with EoS $w=0$ is excluded at more than $2\sigma$ confidence level. These results can be tested with future observations. |

|**Abstract**| The extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) telescope onboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission has finished the first eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS:1), and detected 10$^4$ galaxy clusters in the western Galactic hemisphere. In the radio band, the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope finished its pilot 1 phase of the project 'Evolutionary Map of the Universe' (EMU) with 220.000 sources in a 270 deg$^2$ field overlapping with eRASS:1. These two surveys are used to study radio-mode Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in clusters. In order to understand the efficiency of radio-mode feedback at the centers of galaxy clusters, we relate the radio properties of brightest cluster galaxies (BCG) to the X-ray properties of the host clusters. We identify the central radio sources in eRASS:1 clusters or calculate corresponding upper limits on the radio luminosity. Then, we derive relations between the X-ray properties of the clusters and the radio properties of the corresponding central radio source. We also apply a mid-infrared color criterion using WISE colors to identify AGN. In total we investigate a sample of 75 clusters. We find a statistically significant between the X-ray luminosity of the cluster and the 944 MHz radio luminosity of the corresponding central radio galaxy. There is also a positive trend between the radio power and the largest linear size (LLS) of the radio source. The density and the LLS do not show any correlation. We find that in high luminosity clusters with L_X > $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ the kinetic luminosity of the radio jets is not longer correlated with the X-ray luminosity and discuss various reasons. We find an anti-correlation between the central cooling time t_cool and the radio luminosity L_R indicating a need for more powerful AGN in clusters with short central cooling times. |

|*Comments*| *Submitted to ApJ*|
|**Abstract**| Redshift measurements, primarily obtained from host galaxies, are essential for inferring cosmological parameters from type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Matching SNe to host galaxies using images is non-trivial, resulting in a subset of SNe with mismatched hosts and thus incorrect redshifts. We evaluate the host galaxy mismatch rate and resulting biases on cosmological parameters from simulations modeled after the Dark Energy Survey 5-Year (DES-SN5YR) photometric sample. For both DES-SN5YR data and simulations, we employ the directional light radius method for host galaxy matching. In our SN Ia simulations, we find that 1.7% of SNe are matched to the wrong host galaxy, with redshift difference between the true and matched host of up to 0.6. Using our analysis pipeline, we determine the shift in the dark energy equation of state parameter (Dw) due to including SNe with incorrect host galaxy matches. For SN Ia-only simulations, we find Dw = 0.0013 +/- 0.0026 with constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Including core-collapse SNe and peculiar SNe Ia in the simulation, we find that Dw ranges from 0.0009 to 0.0032 depending on the photometric classifier used. This bias is an order of magnitude smaller than the expected total uncertainty on w from the DES-SN5YR sample of around 0.03. We conclude that the bias on w from host galaxy mismatch is much smaller than the uncertainties expected from the DES-SN5YR sample, but we encourage further studies to reduce this bias through better host-matching algorithms or selection cuts. |

|**Abstract**| In this paper, a total of approximately 2.6 million dwarfs were constructed as standard stars, with an accuracy of about 0.01-0.02 mag for each band, by combining spectroscopic data from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope Data Release 7, photometric data from the corrected Gaia Early Data Release 3, and photometric metallicities. Using the spectroscopy based stellar color regression method (SCR method) and the photometric-based SCR method (SCR' method), we performed the relative calibration of the Nanshan One-meter Wide-field Telescope imaging data. Based on the corrected Pan-STARRS DR1 photometry, the absolute calibration was also performed. In the photometric calibration process, we analyzed the dependence of the calibration zero points on different images (observation time), different gates of the CCD detector, and different CCD positions. We found that the stellar flat and the relative gain between different gates depend on time. The amplitude of gain variation in three channels is approximately 0.5%-0.7% relative to the other channel, with a maximum value of 4%. In addition, significant spatial variations of the stellar flat fitting residual are found and corrected. Using repeated sources in the adjacent images, we checked and discovered internal consistency of about 1-2 mmag in all the filters. Using the PS1 magnitudes synthesized by Gaia DR3 BP/RP spectra by the synthetic photometry method, we found that the photometric calibration uniformity is about 1-2 mmag for all the bands, at a spatial resolution of 1.3 degree. A detailed comparison between the spectroscopy-based SCR and photometric-based SCR method magnitude offsets was performed, and we achieved an internal consistency precision of about 2 mmag or better with resolutions of 1.3 degree for all the filters. Which is mainly from the position-dependent errors of the E(B-V) used in SCR' method. |
