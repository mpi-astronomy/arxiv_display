|**Abstract**|            We present the discovery of a low-mass gas-rich low-surface brightness galaxy in the Dorado Group, at a distance of 17.7 Mpc. Combining deep MeerKAT 21-cm observations from the MeerKAT HI Observations of Nearby Galactic Objects: Observing Southern Emitters (MHONGOOSE) survey with deep photometric images from the VST Early-type Galaxy Survey (VEGAS) we find a stellar and neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) gas mass of $M_\star = 2.23\times10^6$ M$_\odot$ and $M_{\rm HI}=1.68\times10^6$ M$_\odot$, respectively. This low-surface brightness galaxy is the lowest mass HI detection found in a group beyond the Local Universe ($D\gtrsim 10$ Mpc). The dwarf galaxy has the typical overall properties of gas-rich low surface brightness galaxies in the Local group, but with some striking differences. Namely, the MHONGOOSE observations reveal a very low column density ($\sim 10^{18-19}$ cm$^{-2}$) HI disk with asymmetrical morphology possibly supported by rotation and higher velocity dispersion in the centre. There, deep optical photometry and UV-observations suggest a recent enhancement of the star formation. Found at galactocentric distances where in the Local Group dwarf galaxies are depleted of cold gas (at $390$ projected-kpc distance from the group centre), this galaxy is likely on its first orbit within the Dorado group. We discuss the possible environmental effects that may have caused the formation of the HI disk and the enhancement of star formation, highlighting the short-lived phase (a few hundreds of Myr) of the gaseous disk, before either SF or hydrodynamical forces will deplete the gas of the galaxy.         |

|**Abstract**|            The investigation of plasma motions in the solar chromosphere is crucial for understanding the transport of mechanical energy from the interior of the Sun to the outer atmosphere and into interplanetary space. We report the finding of large-amplitude oscillatory transverse motions prevailing in the non-spicular Halpha chromosphere of a small quiet region near the solar disk center. The observation was carried out on 2018 August 25 with the Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager (MiHI) installed as an extension to the spectrograph at the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST). MiHi produced high-resolution Stokes spectra of the Halpha line over a two-dimensional array of points (sampled every 0.066 arcsec on the image plane) every 1.33 s for about 17 min. We extracted the Dopple-shift-insensitive intensity data of the line core by applying a bisector fit to Stoke I line profiles. From our time-distance analysis of the intensity data, we find a variety of transverse motions with velocity amplitudes of up to 40 km/s in fan fibrils and tiny filaments. In particular, in the fan fibrils, large-amplitude transverse MHD waves were seen to occur with a mean velocity amplitude of 25 km/s and a mean period of 5.8 min, propagating at a speed of 40 km/s. These waves are nonlinear and display group behavior. We estimate the wave energy flux in the upper chromosphere at 3 x 10^6 erg cm^-2 s^-1. Our results contribute to the advancement of our understanding of the properties of transverse MHD waves in the solar chromosphere.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report a free-floating planet (FFP) candidate identified from the analysis of the microlensing event KMT-2023-BLG-2669. The lensing light curve is characterized by a short duration $(\lesssim 3\,{\rm days})$ and a small amplitude $(\lesssim 0.7\,{\rm mag})$. From the analysis, we find the Einstein timescale of $t_{\rm E} \backsimeq 0.33\,{\rm days}$ and the Einstein radius of $\theta_{\rm E} \backsimeq 4.41\,{\mu}{\rm as}$. These measurements enable us to infer the lens mass as $M = 8\,M_{\oplus} (\pi_{\rm rel} / 0.1\,{\rm mas})^{-1}$, where $\pi_{\rm rel}$ is the relative lens-source parallax. The inference implies that the lens is a sub-Neptune- to Saturn-mass object depending on its unknown distance. This is the ninth isolated planetary-mass microlens with $\theta_{\rm E} < 10\,{\mu}{\rm as}$, which (as shown by \citealt{gould22}) is a useful threshold for a FFP candidate. We conduct extensive searches for possible signals of a host star in the light curve, but find no strong evidence for the host. We discuss the possibility of using late-time high-resolution imaging to probe for possible hosts.         |
