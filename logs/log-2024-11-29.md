|**Abstract**|            The Coronagraphic Instrument onboard the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is an important stepping stone towards the characterization of habitable, rocky exoplanets. In a technology demonstration phase conducted during the first 18 months of the mission (expected to launch in late 2026), novel starlight suppression technology may enable direct imaging of a Jupiter analog in reflected light. Here we summarize the current activities of the Observation Planning working group formed as part of the Community Participation Program. This working group is responsible for target selection and observation planning of both science and calibration targets in the technology demonstration phase of the Roman Coronagraph. We will discuss the ongoing efforts to expand target and reference catalogs, and to model astrophysical targets (exoplanets and circumstellar disks) within the Coronagraph's expected sensitivity. We will also present preparatory observations of high priority targets.         |

|**Abstract**|            To date, SN 2017ein is the only Type Ic supernova with a directly identified progenitor candidate. This candidate points to a very massive ($>$45 $M_\odot$) Wolf-Rayet progenitor, but its disappearance after the explosion of SN 2017ein remains unconfirmed. In this work, we revisit SN 2017ein in late-time images acquired by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at 2.4--3.8 yrs after peak brightness. We find this source has not disappeared and its brightness and color remain almost the same as in the pre-explosion images. Thus, we conclude that the pre-explosion source is not the genuine progenitor of SN 2017ein. We exclude the possibility that it is a companion star of the progenitor, since it has a much lower extinction than SN 2017ein; its color is also inconsistent with a star cluster, indicated by the newly added magnitude limit in F336W, apart from F555W and F814W. We suggest, therefore, this source is an unrelated star in chance alignment with SN 2017ein. Based on the low ejecta mass, we propose that SN 2017ein is most likely originated from a moderately massive star with $M_{\rm ini}$ $\sim$ 8--20 $M_\odot$, stripped by binary interaction, rather than a very massive Wolf-Rayet progenitor.         |
