|**Abstract**| The clarity of nights is the major factor that should be carefully considered for optical/infrared astronomical observatories in site-testing campaigns. Cloud coverage is directly related to the amount of time available for scientific observations at observatories. In this article, we report on the results of detailed night-time cloud statistics and continuous observing me derived from ground-based all-sky cameras at the Muztagh-ata site from 2017 to 2021. Results obtained from acquisition data show that the proportion of the annual observing me at the Muztagh-ata site is 65%, and the best period with the least cloud coverage and longer continuous observing time is from September to February. We made a comparison of the monthly mean observing nights obtained from our all-sky cameras and CLARA dataset, results show that the discrepancy between them may depend on the cloud top heights. On average, this site can provide 175 clear nights and 169 nights with at least 4 hours of continuous observing time per year. |

|**Abstract**| We present a catalog of distances for 19544 K giants drawn from LAMOST DR8. Most of them are located in the halo of the Milky Way up to ~120~kpc. There are 15% K giants without SDSS photometry, for which we supplements with Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) photometry calibrated to SDSS photometric system. The possible contamination of the red clumps/horizontal branch are removed according to metallicities and colors before the distance determination. Combining the LAMOST spectroscopic metallicities with the SDSS/PS1 photometry, we estimate the absolute magnitudes in SDSS $r-$band, the distance moduli, and the corresponding uncertainties through an Bayesian approach devised by Xue et al. (2014) for the SEGUE halo K-giants. The typical distance precision is about 11%. The stars in the catalog lie in a region of 4-126 kpc from the Galactic center, of which with 6, 320 stars beyond 20 kpc and 273 stars beyond 50 kpc, forming the largest spectroscopic sample of distant tracers in the Milky Way halo so far. |
