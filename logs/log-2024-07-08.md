|**Abstract**|            Over the past decade, progress in observational capabilities, combined with theoretical advancements, have transformed our comprehension of the physics and chemistry during planet formation. Despite these important steps forward, open questions persist on the chemical and physical evolution of solids in their journey from the collapsing molecular cores to disks and planetary bodies. This chapter is a repository of such burning questions. It has the ambition to identify the most promising avenues for future research based on current observational and modeling opportunities.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a multi-wavelength study on three new $z\sim5.6$ quasi stellar objects (QSOs) selected based on their radio and optical/near-infrared properties in publicly available surveys and then identified with dedicated spectroscopic observations. These are among the radio-brightest QSOs currently known at $z>5.5$, having $\rm R=S_{\rm 5GHz}/S_{\rm 4400A}>100$. In this work we present their identification and we also discuss their multi-wavelength properties (from the radio to the X-ray band) based on the detection in public surveys as well as dedicated radio and X-ray observations. The three sources present a wide range of properties, in terms of relative intensity and spectral shape, highlighting the importance of multi-wavelength observations in order to accurately characterise these high-$z$ objects. In particular, from our analysis we found one source, at $z=5.61$, that presents clear blazars properties (strong and flat radio and X-ray emission), making it one of the most distant currently known in this class. Moreover, from the fit of the optical/near-infrared photometric measurements with an accretion disc model, as well as the analysis of the CIV broad emission line in one case, we were able to estimate the mass and the accretion rate of the central black holes in these systems, finding $\rm M_{\rm BH}\sim1-10\times10^9$ M$_\odot$ accreting at a rate $\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim0.1-0.2$. With this work we increase the number of very-high redshift radio-powerful QSOs characterised with multi-wavelength observations, essential in order to understand the evolution and the properties of this still poorly constrained class of sources.         |

|**Abstract**|            Neutral atomic gas (HI) effectively traces galactic dynamics across mid to large galactocentric radii. However, its limitations in observing small-scale changes within the central few kiloparsecs, coupled with the often observed HI deficit in galactic centers, necessitates using molecular gas emission as a preferred tracer in these regions. Understanding the dynamics of both neutral atomic and molecular gas is crucial for a more complete understanding of how galaxies evolve, funnel gas from the outer disk into their central parts, and eventually form stars. In this work we aim to quantify the dynamics of both, the neutral atomic and molecular gas, in the nearby spiral galaxies NGC 1512, NGC 4535, and NGC 7496 using new MeerKAT-HI observations together with ALMA CO (2-1) observations from the PHANGS collaboration. We use the analysis tool 3D-Barolo to fit tilted ring models to the HI and CO observations. A combined approach of using the HI to constrain the true disk orientation parameters before applying these to the CO datasets is tested. This paper sets expectations for the results of the upcoming high-resolution HI coverage of many galaxies in the PHANGS-ALMA sample using MeerKAT or VLA, to establish a robust methodology for characterizing galaxy orientations and deriving dynamics from combining new HI with existing CO data.         |

|**Abstract**|            Recent observations have found a growing number of hypervelocity stars with speeds of $\approx 1500-2500\,$km\,s$^{-1}$ which could have only been produced through thermonuclear supernovae in white dwarf binaries. Most of the observed hypervelocity runaways in this class display a surprising inflated structure: their current radii are roughly an order of magnitude greater than they would have been as white dwarfs filling their Roche lobe. While many simulations exist studying the dynamical phase leading to supernova detonation in these systems, no detailed calculations of the long-term structure of the runaways have yet been performed. We use an existing \textsc{Arepo} hydrodynamical simulation of a supernova in a white dwarf binary as a starting point for the evolution of these stars with the 1 dimensional stellar evolution code MESA. We show that the supernova shock is not enough to inflate the white dwarf over timescales longer than a few thousand years, significantly shorter than the $10^{5-6}$ year lifetimes inferred for observed hypervelocity runaways. Despite experiencing a shock from a supernova less than $\approx 0.02\,R_\odot$ away, our models do not experience significant interior heating, and all contract back to radii around $0.01\,R_\odot$ within about $10^4$\,years. Explaining the observed inflated states requires either an additional source of significant heating or some other physics that is not yet accounted for in the subsequent evolution.         |

|**Abstract**|            Based on a sample of K giant from Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) Data Release 8 and a sample of RR Lyrae (RRL) from \textit{Gaia} Data Release 3, we investigate the compositions of the Hercules-Aquila Cloud (HAC) and Virgo Over-density (VOD) and their collective contribution to the tilt and triaxiality of the stellar halo ($r\,\textless\,40\,{\rm kpc}$) as well as two breaks at $\approx15\,{\rm kpc}$ and 30\,kpc. We apply the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to divide the stellar halo into the isotropic component and the radially biased anisotropic component, namely Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), and find that both HAC and VOD are dominated by the GSE debris stars with weights of $0.67^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ and $0.57^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$, respectively. In addition, using the K giants with orbital parameters, we identify the member stars of known substructures, including GSE, Sagittarius (Sgr), Helmi Streams, Sequoia, Thamnos, Pontus, Wukong, and Metal-weak Thick Disk (MWTD), to probe the compositions of low-eccentricity stars in the HAC and VOD regions. In density fittings of the RRL sample, we note that the absence of HAC and VOD has a weak effect on the shape of halo. Finally, we find that the radially biased anisotropic halo contributes majorly to the stellar halo that can be modelled with a tilted triaxial ellipsoid and a doubly broken power law with breaking radii at $18.08^{+2.04}_{-3.22}\,{\rm kpc}$ and $33.03^{+1.30}_{-1.21}\,{\rm kpc}$. This has important significance for understanding the status of large diffuse over-densities in the Milky Way.         |

|**Abstract**|            Type IIb supernovae are important subclass of stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe), which show H lines only at early times. Their progenitors are believed to contain a low-mass H envelope before explosion. This work reports the discovery of a progenitor candidate in pre-explosion Hubble Space Telescope images for the Type IIb SN~2017gkk. With detailed analysis of its spectral energy distribution and local environment, we suggest that the progenitor is most likely a yellow supergiant with significant circumstellar extinction and has an initial mass of about 16 $M_\odot$, effective temperature log($T_{\rm eff}/K)=3.72\pm0.08$ and luminosity log($L/L_{\odot})=5.17\pm0.04$. This progenitor is not massive enough to strip envelope through stellar wind, and it supports an interacting binary progenitor channel and adds to the growing list of direct progenitor detections for Type~IIb SNe. Future late-time observations will confirm whether this progenitor candidate has disappeared and reveal the putative binary companion that has survived the explosion.         |

|*Comments*| *18 pages, 12 Figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            We observed the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk817 during an intensive multi-wavelength reverberation mapping campaign for 16 months. Here, we examine the behavior of narrow UV absorption lines seen in HST/COS spectra, both during the campaign and in other epochs extending over 14 years. We conclude that while the narrow absorption outflow system (at -3750 km/s with FWHM=177 km/s) responds to the variations of the UV continuum as modified by the X-ray obscurer, its total column density (logNH =19.5 cm-2) did not change across all epochs. The adjusted ionization parameter (scaled with respect to the variations in the Hydrogen ionizing continuum flux) is log UH =-1.0. The outflow is located at a distance smaller than 38 parsecs from the central source, which implies a hydrogen density of nH > 3000 cm-3. The absorption outflow system only covers the continuum emission source and not the broad emission line region, which suggests that its transverse size is small (< 1e16 cm), with potential cloud geometries ranging from spherical to elongated along the line of sight.         |

|**Abstract**|            We investigate the evolution of cosmological scalar perturbations in the case that the background radiation is weakly coupled to a light scalar field $\phi$. The light scalar $\phi$ is a homogeneous background field with a large initial value. In the radiation-dominated Universe, the coupling term introduces an effective mass to $\phi$ and the background ultra-relativistic particles. The oscillations of $\phi$ result in the periodic change of the equation of state parameter and the sound speed, which provides a novel mechanism to amplify subhorizon scalar perturbations through parametric resonance. The amplification of scalar perturbations leads to a stochastic gravitational-waves background~(SGWB) expected to be observed by multiband gravitational wave observers. The observation of the SGWB helps to determine the initial value of $\phi$ and the coupling strength of the interaction. This mechanism is generally applicable to the interactions that introduce an effective mass, and we take the interaction between $\phi$ and electrons as a concrete example to illustrate the result. We find that under the condition that the coupling coefficient $\lambda=10^{-16}$ and the initial value $\phi_i=10^{18}$ GeV, the resulting SGWB spectrum is expected to be observed by the future observers including LISA, $Taiji$, DECIGO and BBO.         |

|| G. Park, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-07-08*|

|**Abstract**|            We present a comprehensive analysis of young stellar object (YSO) variability within the M17 Southwest Extension (M17 SWex), using 3.5 years of monitoring data from the JCMT Transient Survey at sub-millimeter (sub-mm) and 9 years from the NEOWISE mission at mid-infrared (mid-IR). Our study encompasses observations of 147 bright sub-mm peaks identified within our deep JCMT co-added map as well as 156 YSOs in NEOWISE W1 and 179 in W2 that were previously identified in Spitzer surveys. We find three robust sub-mm variables: two are candidate YSOs and one is a likely extragalactic source. At mid-IR wavelengths, our analysis reveals secular and stochastic variability in 47 YSOs, with the highest fraction of secular variability occurring at the earliest evolutionary stage. This is similar to what has previously been observed for low-mass YSO variability within the Gould Belt. However, we observe less overall variability in M17SWex at both the sub-mm and mid-IR. We suspect that this lower fraction is due to the greater distance to M17 SWex. Our findings showcase the utility of multi-wavelength observations to better capture the complex variability phenomena inherent to star formation processes and demonstrate the importance of years-long monitoring of a diverse selection of star-forming environments.         |
