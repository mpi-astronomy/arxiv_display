|**Abstract**| We develop a neural network based pipeline to estimate masses of galaxy clusters with a known redshift directly from photon information in X-rays. Our neural networks are trained using supervised learning on simulations of eROSITA observations, focusing in this paper on the Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS). We use convolutional neural networks which are modified to include additional information of the cluster, in particular its redshift. In contrast to existing work, we utilize simulations including background and point sources to develop a tool which is usable directly on observational eROSITA data for an extended mass range from group size halos to massive clusters with masses in between $10^{13}M_\odot<M<10^{15}M_\odot.$ Using this method, we are able to provide for the first time neural network mass estimation for the observed eFEDS cluster sample from Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma/eROSITA observations and we find consistent performance with weak lensing calibrated masses. In this measurement, we do not use weak lensing information and we only use previous cluster mass information which was used to calibrate the cluster properties in the simulations. When compared to simulated data, we observe a reduced scatter with respect to luminosity and count-rate based scaling relations. We comment on the application for other upcoming eROSITA All-Sky Survey observations. |
