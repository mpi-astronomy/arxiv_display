|**Abstract**| Deep VLT/MUSE optical integral field spectroscopy has recently revealed an abundant population of ultra-faint galaxies ($M_{UV} = -$15; 0.01 $L_{\star}$) at $z=$2.9$-$6.7 due to their strong Lyman-$\alpha$ emission. The implied Lyman-$\alpha$ equivalent widths are in excess of 100-200 Angstrom, challenging existing models of normal star formation and implying extremely young ages, small stellar masses, and a very low amount of metal enrichment. We use JWST/NIRSpec's microshutter array to follow-up 45 of these galaxies (11h in G235M/F170LP and 7h in G395M/F290LP), as well as 45 lower-equivalent width Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters. Our spectroscopy covers the range 1.7$-$5.1 micron in order to target strong optical emission lines: H$\alpha$, [OIII], H$\beta$, and [NII]. Individual measurements as well as stacks reveal line ratios consistent with a metal poor nature (2$-$30% $Z_{\odot}$) and intense ionizing radiation fields. The galaxies with the highest equivalent widths of Lyman-$\alpha$, in excess of 120 Angstrom, have lower gas-phase metallicities than those with lower equivalent widths. This implies a selection based on Lyman-$\alpha$ equivalent width is an efficient technique for identifying younger, less chemically enriched systems. |

|**Abstract**| We present a new approach to measuring the thickness of a partially face-on stellar disk, using dust geometry. In a moderately-inclined disk galaxy, the fraction of reddened stars is expected to be 50% everywhere, assuming that dust lies in a thin midplane. In a thickened disk, however, a wide range of radii project onto the line of sight. Assuming stellar density declines with radius, this geometrical projection leads to differences in the numbers of stars on the near and far sides of the thin dust layer. The fraction of reddened stars will thus differ from the 50% prediction, with a deviation that becomes larger for puffier disks. We map the fraction of reddened red giant branch (RGB) stars across M31, which shows prominent dust lanes on only one side of the major axis. The fraction of reddened stars varies systematically from 20% to 80%, which requires that these stars have an exponential scale height h_z that is 0.14+/-0.015 times the exponential scale length (h_r~5.5kpc). M31's RGB stars must therefore have h_z=770+/-80pc, which is far thicker than the Milky Way's thin disk, but comparable to its thick disk. The lack of a significant thin disk in M31 is unexpected, but consistent with its interaction history and high disk velocity dispersion. We suggest that asymmetric reddening be used as a generic criteria for identifying ``thick disk'' dominated systems, and discuss prospects for future 3-dimensional tomographic mapping of the gas and stars in M31. |
