|**Abstract**| Following the assumption that the disc substructures observed in protoplanetary discs originate from the interaction between the disc and the forming planets embedded therein, we aim to test if these putative planets could represent the progenitors of the currently observed giant exoplanets. We performed N-body simulations assuming initially three, four, five or seven planets. Our model includes pebble and gas accretion, migration, damping of eccentricities and inclinations, disc-planet interaction and disc evolution. We locate the planets in the positions where the gaps in protoplanetary discs have been observed and we evolve the systems for 100Myr including a few Myr of gas disc evolution, while also testing three values of $\alpha$ viscosity. For planetary systems with initially three and four planets we find that most of the growing planets lie beyond the RV detection limit of 5AU and only a small fraction of them migrate into the inner region. We also find that these systems have too low final eccentricities to be in agreement with the observed giant planet population. Systems initially consisting of five or seven planets become unstable after $\approx$40Kyr of integration time. This clearly shows that not every gap can host a planet. The general outcome of our simulations - too low eccentricities - is independent of the disc's viscosity and surface density. Further observations could either confirm the existence of an undetected population of wide-orbit giants or exclude the presence of such undetected population to constrain how many planets hide in gaps even further. |

|**Abstract**| Pulsars are fast spinning neutron stars that lose their rotational energy via various processes such as gravitational and magnetic radiation, particle acceleration and mass loss processes. This dissipation can be quantified by a spin-down equation that measures the rate of change of the frequency as a function of the rotational frequency itself. We explore the pulsar spin-down and consider the spin-down equation upto the seventh order in frequency. This seventh order term accounts for energy loss due to the gravitational radiation caused by a current type quadrupole in the pulsar due to $r$-modes. We derive the rotational frequency due to the $r$-modes and find a solution in terms of the Lambert function. We also present an analytic exact solution for the period from the spindown equation and numerically verify this for the Crab pulsar. This analysis will be relevant for the detection of continuous gravitational waves by 3G ground based and space based gravitational wave detectors. |
