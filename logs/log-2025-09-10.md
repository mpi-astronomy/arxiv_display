|**Abstract**|            The stellar haloes and intra-cluster light around galaxies are crucial test beds for dark matter (DM) physics and galaxy formation models. We consider the role that the numerical resolution plays in the modelling of these systems by studying the stripping of satellites in the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations. We focus on host haloes of total halo mass $M_\mathrm{200c}=10^{12-15}M_{\odot}$ and satellites of stellar mass $>10^{7}$$M_{\odot}$, and compare stellar halo / satellite properties across 9 IllustrisTNG runs with baryonic particle mass resolution between $8.5\times10^4M_{\odot}$ and $7\times10^8$$M_{\odot}$, using a Lagrangian-region technique to identify counterpart satellites across different resolution simulations of the same volume. We publish the corresponding catalogues alongside this paper. We demonstrate that the stripping of DM from satellites that orbit in group- and cluster-mass hosts is largely independent of resolution at least until 90 per cent of their initial mass at infall has been stripped. We do not find evidence for spurious disruption of galaxies due to insufficient resolution for the satellite masses we consider. By contrast, the stripping of stellar mass is strongly resolution-dependent: each factor of 8 improvement in particle stellar mass typically adds 2~Gyr to the stripping time. Improved numerical resolution within the IllustrisTNG model generally results in more compact satellites with larger stellar masses, which in turn generate more centrally concentrated stellar haloes and intra-cluster mass profiles. However, the concomitant increase in stellar mass of both satellites and hosts may still be the cause for the overprediction of the stellar halo mass at large host radii relative to observations seen in some previous studies.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a comprehensive 3D dust reddening map covering the entire Milky Way, constructed by combining reddening estimates based on LAMOST low-resolution spectra (E(B$-$V)$_{\rm LAMOST}$) with those derived from $Gaia$ XP spectra (E(B$-$V)$_{\rm XP}$), along with revised $Gaia$ distances. E(B$-$V)$_{\rm LAMOST}$ values of $\sim$ 4.6 million unique sources were obtained with the standard-pair analysis using LAMOST DR11 stellar parameters and synthesized $B/V$-band photometry from $Gaia$ XP spectra, showing a typical precision of $\sim$ 0.01 mag. The E(B$-$V)$_{\rm XP}$ from the catalog of \citet{zhang2023}, which was derived using forward modeling of $Gaia$ XP spectra, were cross-validated with E(B$-$V)$_{\rm LAMOST}$, leading to the selection of $\sim$ 150 million high-reliability measurements. The combined dataset achieves a median precision of $\sim$ 0.03 mag for E(B$-$V). To model the reddening -- distance relationship along various lines-of-sight, we implemented a parametric approach that accounts for contributions from the local bubble, diffuse interstellar-medium, and multiple potential molecular clouds. The sky was adaptively partitioned based on stellar density, resulting in angular resolutions ranging from 3.4$^{\prime}$ to 58$^{\prime}$, with about half of the sky having a resolution better than 6.9$^{\prime}$. The reddening precision of our 3D map for individual stars reaches $\sim$ 0.01 mag in most regions at $|b| > 20^\circ$, but degrades to 0.01-0.05 mag at $|b| < 20^\circ$. The map reaches a maximum distance of 3-5 kpc in high-extinction regions with $|b| < 5^\circ$, and extends to 10-15 kpc elsewhere. An interactive platform and Python package have been developed for utilization of the 3D dust map. Available online: this https URL.         |

|| <mark>M. Zhang</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-09-10*|

|**Abstract**|            Tidal disruption events (TDEs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) mark a regime where traditional vacuum models fail to capture the full dynamics, especially due to interaction between stellar debris and pre-existing accretion disks. We perform meshless hydrodynamic simulations incorporating both general relativistic (GR) effects and radiative cooling to study TDEs in AGNs with different orbital inclinations ($\theta_{\rm inc}$) of the disrupted star, ranging from projected prograde to retrograde orbits. We post-process the simulations to derive multi-wavelength light curves and identify several distinct features in the light curves, including a precursor flare from early debris-disk collision and a major flare driven by fallback. The dynamics of the stellar debris and accretion disk, and subsequently the light curve features, are strongly affected by $\theta_{\rm inc}$ and GR effects. Retrograde orbits ($\theta_{\rm inc}=135^\circ$) yield a more luminous, shorter major flare and a more prominent precursor than prograde ones ($\theta_{\rm inc}=22.5^\circ$). During fallback, prograde cases ($\theta_{\rm inc} = 22.5^\circ$, $45^\circ$) develop a central cavity with spirals in the inner region of the AGN disk, leading to transient UV/X-ray suppression accompanied by oscillations, while higher inclinations ($\theta_{\rm inc}=90^\circ$, $135^\circ$) form a gradually tilting inner disk, potentially causing UV/X-ray dips via geometric effects at certain viewing angles. Relativistic apsidal precession alters stream collisions, producing structural differences in the inner disk, outer disk, and debris compared to Newtonian cases, and drives quasi-periodic signals in prograde configurations. These results provide predictive diagnostics for identifying AGN TDEs and interpreting observed light-curve diversity.         |

|**Abstract**|            Based on the updated M giant star catalog selected from LAMOST DR9, we iden-tify substructures within the integrals-of-motion space through Friends-of-Friends cluster-ing algorithm. We obtain members belonging to several known substructures: the Sagittarius stream, Galactic Anticenter Substructure (GASS), Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES), Splash, and the high-{\alpha} disk. Furthermore, we also identify two groups which cannot be clearly asso-ciated with previously known substructures. Our findings confirm the existence of metal-rich constituents within the GES, representing newly formed stars that originated from the metal-enriched gas delivered during the GES merger event and subsequently evolved. Additionally, this study further expands the sample of GASS, high-{\alpha} disk, and Splash stars. Analysis of these metal-rich M giant stars as members of the GES, Splash, and high-{\alpha} disk compo-nents supports an evolution scenario for the early Milky Way, as proposed by previous stud-ies. In this scenario, stars initially formed in a high-{\alpha} primordial disk were dynamically heated by the massive accretion event (GES). This process redistributed stellar orbits, creat-ing the Splash population, while the undisturbed portion of the primordial disk persisted as the present-day high-{\alpha} disk component.         |
