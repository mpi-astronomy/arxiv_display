|**Abstract**| We present new maps of the Milky Way disk showing the distribution of metallicity ([Fe/H]), $\alpha$-element abundances ([Mg/Fe]), and stellar age, using a sample of 66,496 red giant stars from the final data release (DR17) of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. We measure radial and vertical gradients, quantify the distribution functions for age and metallicity, and explore chemical clock relations across the Milky Way for the low-$\alpha$ disk, high-$\alpha$ disk, and total population independently. The low-$\alpha$ disk exhibits a negative radial metallicity gradient of $-0.06 \pm 0.001$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, which flattens with distance from the midplane. The high-$\alpha$ disk shows a flat radial gradient in metallicity and age across nearly all locations of the disk. The age and metallicity distribution functions shift from negatively skewed in the inner Galaxy to positively skewed at large radius. Significant bimodality in the [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane and in the [Mg/Fe]-age relation persist across the entire disk. The age estimates have typical uncertainties of $\sim0.15$ in $\log$(age) and may be subject to additional systematic errors, which impose limitations on conclusions drawn from this sample. Nevertheless, these results act as critical constraints on galactic evolution models, constraining which physical processes played a dominant role in the formation of the Milky Way disk. We discuss how radial migration predicts many of the observed trends near the solar neighborhood and in the outer disk, but an additional more dramatic evolution history, such as the multi-infall model or a merger event, is needed to explain the chemical and age bimodality elsewhere in the Galaxy. |

|**Abstract**| Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGN) have been observed to change optical spectral type. Mrk 1018 is unique: first classified as a type 1.9 Seyfert galaxy, it transitioned to a type 1 before returning to its initial classification after approximately 30 years. We present a high-cadence monitoring programme that caught a major outburst in 2020. Due to sunblock, only the decline could be observed. We studied X-ray, UV, optical, and IR before and after the outburst to investigate the responses of the AGN structures. We derived a u'-band light curve of the AGN contribution alone. The flux increased by a factor of the order of 13. We confirmed this in other optical bands and determined the shape and speed of the decline in each waveband. The shapes of H beta and H alpha were analysed before and after the event. Two XMM-Newton observations from before and after the outburst were also exploited. The outburst is asymmetric, with a swifter rise than decline. The decline is best fit by a linear function, ruling out a tidal disruption event. The optical spectrum shows no change approximately 8 months before and 17 months after. The UV flux increased slightly after the outburst but the X-ray primary flux is unchanged. However, the 6.4 keV Iron line has doubled in strength. IR data taken 13 days after the observed optical peak show an increased emission level. Calculating the distance of the broad-line region and inner edge of the torus from the supermassive black hole can explain the multi-wavelength response to the outburst, in particular: i) the unchanged H beta and H alpha lines, ii) the unchanged primary X-ray spectral components, iii) the rapid and extended infrared response, as well as iv) the enhanced emission of the reflected 6.4 keV line. The outburst was due to a dramatic and short-lasting change in the intrinsic accretion rate. We discuss different models as potential causes. |

|**Abstract**| We present an analysis of microlensing event OGLE-2019-BLG-0825. This event was identified as a planetary candidate by preliminary modeling. We find that significant residuals from the best-fit static binary-lens model exist and a xallarap effect can fit the residuals very well and significantly improves $\chi^2$ values. On the other hand, by including the xallarap effect in our models, we find that binary-lens parameters like mass-ratio, $q$, and separation, $s$, cannot be constrained well. However, we also find that the parameters for the source system like the orbital period and semi major axis are consistent between all the models we analyzed. We therefore constrain the properties of the source system better than the properties of the lens system. The source system comprises a G-type main-sequence star orbited by a brown dwarf with a period of $P\sim5$ days. This analysis is the first to demonstrate that the xallarap effect does affect binary-lens parameters in planetary events. It would not be common for the presence or absence of the xallarap effect to affect lens parameters in events with long orbital periods of the source system or events with transits to caustics, but in other cases, such as this event, the xallarap effect can affect binary-lens parameters. |

|**Abstract**| Direct imaging observations of planets revealed that wide-orbit ($>10$ au) giant planets exist even around subsolar-metallicity host stars and do not require metal-rich environments for their formation. A possible formation mechanism of wide-orbit giant planets in subsolar-metallicity environments is the gravitational fragmentation of massive protoplanetary discs. Here, we follow the long-term evolution of the disc for 1 Myr after its formation, which is comparable to disc lifetime, by way of a two-dimensional thin-disc hydrodynamic simulation with the metallicity of 0.1 ${\rm Z}_{\odot}$. We find a giant protoplanet that survives until the end of the simulation. The protoplanet is formed by the merger of two gaseous clumps at $\sim$0.5 Myr after disc formation, and then it orbits $\sim$200 au from the host star for $\sim$0.5 Myr. The protoplanet's mass is $\sim$10 ${\rm M}_{\rm J}$ at birth and gradually decreases to 1 ${\rm M}_{\rm J}$ due to the tidal effect from the host star. The result provides the minimum mass of 1 ${\rm M}_{\rm J}$ for protoplanets formed by gravitational instability in a subsolar-metallicity disc. We anticipate that the mass of a protoplanet experiencing reduced mass loss thanks to the protoplanetary contraction in higher resolution simulations can increase to $\sim$10 ${\rm M}_{\rm J}$. We argue that the disc gravitational fragmentation would be a promising pathway to form wide-orbit giant planets with masses of $\ge1$ ${\rm M}_{\rm J}$ in subsolar-metallicity environments. |
