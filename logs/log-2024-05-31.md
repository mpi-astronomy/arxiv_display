|**Abstract**|            A suite of spectroscopic surveys is producing vast sets of stellar spectra with the goal of advancing stellar physics and Galactic evolution by determining their basic physical properties. A substantial fraction of these stars are in binary systems, but almost all large-survey modeling pipelines treat them as single stars. For sets of multi-epoch spectra, spectral disentangling is a powerful technique to recover or constrain the individual components' spectra of a multiple system. So far, this approach has focused on small samples or individual objects, usually with high resolution ($R \gtrsim 10.000$) spectra and many epochs ($\gtrsim 8$). Here, we present a disentangling implementation that accounts for several aspects of few-epoch spectra from large surveys: that vast sample sizes require automatic determination of starting guesses; that some of the most extensive spectroscopic surveys have a resolution of only $\approx 2,000$; that few epochs preclude unique orbit fitting; that one needs effective regularisation of the disentangled solution to ensure resulting spectra are smooth. We describe the implementation of this code and show with simulated spectra how well spectral recovery can work for hot and cool stars at $R \approx 2000$. Moreover, we verify the code on two established binary systems, the ``Unicorn'' and ``Giraffe''. This code can serve to explore new regimes in survey disentangling in search of massive stars with massive dark companions, e.g. the $\gtrsim 200,000$ hot stars of the SDSS-V survey.         |

|**Abstract**|            Low mass-ratio (q) contact binary systems are progenitors of stellar mergers such as blue straggles (BS) or fast-rotating FK Com stars. In this study, we present the first light curve analysis of two newly identified low mass-ratio contact binary systems, TIC 55007847 and TIC 63597006, that are identified from TESS. Both stars are classified as A-subtype contact binaries. We obtained the precise orbit periods for the two objects by using the O-C method, i.e. P=0.6117108 d for TIC 55007847 and P=0.7008995 d for TIC 63597006, respectively, and found an obvious periodic signal in the O-C curve of TIC 63597006. We suggest that the periodic signal comes from a third body. We further use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with PHOEBE to derive the photometric solutions for the two binaries. The photometric solution for this object shows that the contribution of the third body is about 6%. Our analysis revealed that TIC 55007847 has an extremely low mass ratio of q=0.08. By calculating the ratio of spin angular momentum to the orbital angular momentum Js/Jo, we found that TIC 55007847 is very close to the instability threshold with Js/Jo = 0.31, indicating that it may merge into a single, fast-rotating star in the future. For TIC 63597006, q=0.14 and Js/Jo=0.15. This object is in a relatively stable evolutionary status at present.         |

|| K. Xiao, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-05-31*|
|*Comments*| *9 pages, 5 figures; ApJL accepted, see main result in Figures 5*|
|**Abstract**|            We search for an optimal filter design for the estimation of stellar metallicity, based on synthetic photometry from Gaia XP spectra convolved with a series of filter-transmission curves defined by different central wavelengths and bandwidths. Unlike previous designs based solely on maximizing metallicity sensitivity, we find that the optimal solution provides a balance between the sensitivity and uncertainty of the spectra. With this optimal filter design, the best precision of metallicity estimates for relatively bright ($G \sim 11.5$) stars is excellent, $\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]} = 0.034$\,dex for FGK dwarf stars, superior to that obtained utilizing custom sensitivity-optimized filters (e.g., SkyMapper\,$v$). By selecting hundreds of high-probabability member stars of the open cluster M67, our analysis reveals that the intrinsic photometric-metallicity scatter of these cluster members is only 0.036\,dex, consistent with this level of precision. Our results clearly demonstrate that the internal precision of photometric-metallicity estimates can be extremely high, even providing the opportunity to perform chemical tagging for very large numbers of field stars in the Milky Way. This experiment shows that it is crucial to take into account uncertainty alongside the sensitivity when designing filters for measuring the stellar metallicity and other parameters.         |
