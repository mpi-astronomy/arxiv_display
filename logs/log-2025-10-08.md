|**Abstract**|            The mid-infrared (MIR) emitting regions of the individual protoplanetary disks in the binary system Z CMa are resolved by MATISSE/VLTI. The observations were obtained during a serendipitous large outburst of the HBe star that lasted more than 100 days, while the FUor companion is presumed to be in quiescence. The size of the MIR-emitting disk region of the more massive HBe star increases toward longer wavelengths from $<14$ mas at 3.5$\mu m$ to $\ll 50$ mas at 11.5$\mu m$ . The lack of substructures in the HBe disk might suggest that it is a continuous disk; however, this could be due to observational constraints. We also note a radial variation of the silicate absorption feature over the disk, where the optical depth increases inwards of $<$40~au radii. This contradicts the scenario of a carved, dusty cocoon surrounding the HBe star. In the case of the less massive FUor companion, the MIR-emitting region is much smaller with an angular size $\leq$15 mas (or else a physical radius $<9$ au) in all bands, suggesting a compact disk. Both disks are aligned within uncertainties, and their orientation agrees with that of the known jets. Furthermore, MATISSE data place the binary's separation at $117.88 \pm 0.73$ mas and a position angle of $139.16^o\,\pm\,0.29^o$ east of north. Our estimates for the orbital elements gave an eccentric orbit ($e\sim0.17$) with a moderate inclination ($i\sim 66$\degr). The derived total mass is $M_{\rm total} = 16.4^{+2.1}_{-2.3}$ M$_\odot$, while the period is approximately 950 years. Our MATISSE imaging of the Herbig disk during outburst indicates a temperature gradient for the disk, while imaging of the FUor companion's disk corroborates previous studies showing that FUor disks are rather compact in the MIR. We cannot infer any misalignment between the MATISSE results and earlier ALMA/JVLA data, nor can we infer any influence from the alleged flyby event.         |

|**Abstract**|            Stars primarily form in galactic spiral arms within dense, filamentary molecular clouds. The largest and most elongated of these molecular clouds are referred to as ``bones," which are massive, velocity-coherent filaments (lengths ~20 to >100 pc, widths ~1-2 pc) that run approximately parallel and in close proximity to the Galactic plane. While these bones have been generally well characterized, the importance and structure of their magnetic fields (B-fields) remain largely unconstrained. Through the SOFIA Legacy program FIELDMAPS, we mapped the B-fields of 10 bones in the Milky Way. We found that their B-fields are varied, with no single preferred alignment along the entire spine of the bones. At higher column densities, the spines of the bones are more likely to align perpendicularly to the B-fields, although this is not ubiquitous, and the alignment shows no strong correlation with the locations of identified young stellar objects. We estimated the B-field strengths across the bones and found them to be ~30-150 $\mu$G at pc scales. Despite the generally low virial parameters, the B-fields are strong compared to the local gravity, suggesting that B-fields play a significant role in resisting global collapse. Moreover, the B-fields may slow and guide gas flow during dissipation. Recent star formation within the bones may be due to high-density pockets at smaller scales, which could have formed before or simultaneously with the bones.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a rigorous identification of candidates for dormant black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs) in binaries using summary statistics from Gaia DR3, rather than full orbital solutions. Although Gaia astrometric orbits have already revealed a small sample of compact object binaries, many systems remain undetected due to stringent quality cuts imposed on the published orbits. Using a forward-modelling framework that simulates Gaia observables, in particular the renormalised unit weight error (ruwe) and radial velocity (RV) scatter, we infer posterior distributions for companion mass and orbital period via MCMC sampling, marginalising over nuisance orbital parameters. We validate our approach by comparing the predicted masses and periods against full orbit solutions from DR3, and by successfully recovering known compact object binaries as promising candidates. The method is best suited for systems with red giant primaries, which have more reliable Gaia RV scatter and a light centroid more likely dominated by one component, compared to main-sequence stars. And they are less likely to be triples with short-period inner binaries, which produce confounding signatures. We apply the method to three million giants and identify 556 systems with best-fit companion masses $\gtrsim 3\,M_\odot$. Recovery simulations suggest our selection method is substantially more sensitive than the DR3 non-single-star catalogue, particularly for binaries with periods below 1 year and above $\sim 6$ years. These candidates represent promising targets for spectroscopic follow-up and Gaia DR4 analysis to confirm the presence of compact objects. Candidate main-sequence stars with massive companions face a larger set of confounding effects. Therefore, we present an analogous catalogue of 279 additional `main sequence' candidates only as an appendix.         |

|**Abstract**|            Complex energy transfer processes in the intracluster medium (ICM) can revive fossil (with spectral ages $\gg100$ Myr) plasma initially generated by radio galaxies. This leads to the re-ignition of faint radio sources with irregular and filamentary morphologies, and ultra-steep ($\alpha \gtrsim 1.5$) synchrotron spectra, which can be more easily detected at low frequencies ($\sim 100$ MHz). These sources offer the opportunity to investigate the microphysics of the ICM and its interplay with radio galaxies, the origin of seed relativistic electrons, the merging history of the host cluster, and the phenomenology of radio filaments. The study of revived sources has so far been hampered by the requirement of sensitive and high-resolution multi-frequency radio data at low frequencies to characterise their spatial properties and provide a proper classification. We aim to perform the analysis of a sample of candidate revived sources identified among nearby ($z\leq0.35$) and low-mass ($M_{500}\leq5\times 10^{14} M_\odot$) \textit{Planck} clusters in the footprint of LoTSS-DR2. By inspecting LoTSS-DR2 images at 144 MHz, we identified 7 targets with patchy and filamentary morphologies, which have been followed-up with the uGMRT at 400 MHz. By combining LOFAR and uGMRT data, we obtained high-resolution images and spectral index maps, which we used to interpret the nature of the sources. All targets show regions with very steep spectra, confirming the effectiveness of our morphology-based selection in identifying fossil plasma. Based on their morphology, spectral properties, and optical associations, we investigated the origin of the targets. We found a variety of promising revived fossil sources, while also showing that apparently intricate structures can be easily misclassified in the absence of high-resolution and multi-band data.         |

|**Abstract**|            We analyzed Insight-HXMT data of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630 during the type-B QPO phase of its 2019 outburst. Using the Gaussian process method, we applied an additive composite kernel model consisting of an SHO, a DRW, and an additional white noise (AWN) to data from three energy bands: LE (1-10 keV), ME (10-30 keV), and HE (30-150 keV). We find that for the DRW component, correlations on the timescale of $\tau_{\rm DRW}\sim10$ s are absent in the LE band, while they persist in the ME and HE bands over the full duration of the light curves. This energy-dependent behavior may reflect thermal instabilities, with the shorter correlation timescale in the disk compared to the corona. Alternatively, it may reflect variable Comptonizations of seed photons from different disk regions. Inner-disk photons are scattered by a small inner corona, producing soft X-rays. Outer-disk photons interact with an extended, jet-like corona, resulting in harder emission. The QPO is captured by an SHO component with a stable period of $\sim 0.2$ s and a high quality factor of $\sim 10$. The absence of significant evolution with energy or time of the SHO component suggests a connection between the accretion disk and the corona, which may be built by coherent oscillations of disk-corona driven by magnetorotational instability. The AWN components are present in all the three-band data and dominate over the DRW and SHO components. We interpret the AWN as another fast DRW with its $\tau_{\rm DRW} < 0.01$ s. It may trace high-frequency fluctuations that occur in both the inner region of the accretion disk and the corona. Overall, our work reveals a timescale hierarchy in the coupled disk-corona scenario: fast DRW < SHO < disk DRW < corona DRW.         |

|**Abstract**|            Infrared emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) play a major role in determining the charge balance of their host environments that include photo-dissociation regions (PDRs) in galaxies, planetary nebulae, and rims of molecular clouds. We aim to investigate the distribution and sizes of charged PAHs across the key zones of the Orion Bar PDR. We employ JWST MIRI-MRS observations of the Orion Bar from the Early Release Science program ''PDRs4All'' and synthetic images in the JWST MIRI filters. We investigate the spatial morphology of the AIBs at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.0 $\mu$m that commonly trace PAH cations, and the neutral PAH-tracing 11.2 $\mu$m AIB, their (relative) correlations, and the relationship with existing empirical prescriptions for AIBs. The 6.2. 7.7, 8.6, 11.0, and 11.2 $\mu$m AIBs are similar in spatial morphology, on larger scales. Analyzing three-feature intensity correlations, two distinct groups emerge: the 8.6 and 11.0 $\mu$m vs. the 6.2 and 7.7 $\mu$m AIBs. We attribute these correlations to PAH size. The 6.2 and 7.7 $\mu$m AIBs trace cationic, medium-sized PAHs. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that the 8.6 $\mu$m AIB is carried by large, compact, cationic PAHs, and the 11.0 $\mu$m AIB's correlation to it implies, so is this band. The 6.2/8.6 and 7.7/8.6 PAH band ratios thus probe PAH size. We conclude that the 6.2/11.2 AIB ratio is the most reliable proxy for charged PAHs, within the cohort. We outline JWST MIRI imaging prescriptions that serve as effective tracers of the PAH ionization fraction as traced. This study showcases the efficacy of the 6-9 $\mu$m AIBs to probe the charge state and size distribution of the emitting PAHs, offering insights into the physical conditions of their host environments. JWST MIRI photometry offers a viable alternative to IFU spectroscopy for characterizing this emission in extended objects.         |

|*Comments*| *16 pages main text + 4 appendices. ApJ in press. We publish all data products (including galaxy sizes, UV and IR surface brightness profiles, stellar mass and SFR profiles, and conversion factor estimates) at this https URL*|
|**Abstract**|            We present radial profiles of surface brightness in UV and IR bands, estimate stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma_\star$) and star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$), and predict the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$) for over 5,000 local galaxies with stellar mass $M_\star\,{\geq}\,10^{9.3}\rm\,M_\odot$. We build these profiles and measure galaxy half-light radii using GALEX and WISE images from the $z$0MGS program, with special care given to highly inclined galaxies. From the UV and IR surface brightness profiles, we estimate $\Sigma_\star$ and $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ and use them to predict $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ with state-of-the-art empirical prescriptions. We validate our (kpc-scale) $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ predictions against observational estimates, finding the best agreement when accounting for CO-dark gas as well as CO emissivity and excitation effects. The CO-dark correction plays a primary role in lower-mass galaxies, whereas CO emissivity and excitation effects become more important in higher-mass and more actively star-forming galaxies, respectively. We compare our estimated $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ to observed galaxy-integrated SFR to CO luminosity ratio as a function of $M_\star$. A large compilation of literature data suggests that star-forming galaxies with $M_\star = 10^{9.5{-}11}\,M_\odot$ show strong anti-correlations of SFR/$L^\prime_\mathrm{CO(1{-}0)} \propto M_\star^{-0.29}$ and SFR/$L^\prime_\mathrm{CO(2{-}1)} \propto M_\star^{-0.40}$. The estimated $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ trends, when combined with a constant molecular gas depletion time $t_\mathrm{dep}$, can only explain ${\approx}1/3$ of these SFR/$L^\prime_\mathrm{CO}$ trends. This suggests that $t_\mathrm{dep}$ being systematically shorter in lower-mass star-forming galaxies is the main cause of the observed SFR/$L^\prime_\mathrm{CO}$ variations. (Abridged)         |
