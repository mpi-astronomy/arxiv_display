|**Abstract**| Post-common-envelope binaries (PCEBs) containing a white dwarf (WD) and a main-sequence (MS) star can constrain the physics of common envelope evolution and calibrate binary evolution models. Most PCEBs studied to date have short orbital periods ($P_{\rm orb} \lesssim 1$ d), implying relatively inefficient harnessing of binaries' orbital energy for envelope expulsion. Here, we present follow-up observations of five binaries from {\it Gaia} DR3 containing solar-type MS stars and probable ultramassive WDs ($M\gtrsim 1.2\,M_{\odot}$) with significantly wider orbits than previously known PCEBs, $P_{\rm orb} = 18-49$ d. The WD masses are much higher than expected for systems formed via stable mass transfer at these periods, and their near-circular orbits suggest partial tidal circularization when the WD progenitors were giants. These properties strongly suggest that the binaries are PCEBs. Forming PCEBs at such wide separations requires highly efficient envelope ejection, and we find that the observed periods can only be explained if a significant fraction of the energy released when the envelope recombines goes into ejecting it. Using 1D stellar evolution calculations, we show that the binding energy of massive AGB star envelopes is formally {\it positive} if recombination energy is included in the energy budget. This suggests that the star's envelope can be efficiently ejected if binary interaction causes it to recombine, and that a wide range of PCEB orbital periods can potentially result from Roche lobe overflow of an AGB star. This evolutionary scenario may also explain the formation of several wide WD+MS binaries discovered via self-lensing. |

|**Abstract**| In the context of an evolutionary model, the outflow phase of an Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) occurs at the peak of its activity, once the central SMBH is massive enough to generate sufficient power to counterbalance the potential well of the host galaxy. This phase plays a vital role in galaxy evolution. We aim to apply various selection methods to isolate powerful AGNs in the feedback phase, trace and characterise their outflows, and explore the link between AGN luminosity and outflow properties. We applied a combination of methods to the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth survey (eFEDS) catalogue and isolated ~1400 candidates at z>0.5 out of ~11750 AGNs (~12\%). We tested the robustness of our selection on the small subsample of 50 sources with available good quality SDSS spectra at 0.5<z<1, for which we fitted the [OIII] emission line complex and searched for the presence of ionised gas outflows. We identified 23 quasars (~45\%) with evidence of ionised outflows based on the presence of significant broad and shifted components in the [OIII] line. They are on average more luminous and more obscured than the parent sample, although this may be ascribed to selection effects affecting the good quality SDSS spectra sample. By adding 118 outflowing quasars at 0.5<z<3.5 from the literature, we find a weak correlation between the maximum outflow velocity and AGN bolometric luminosity. On the contrary, we find strong correlations between mass outflow rate and outflow kinetic power with the AGN bolometric luminosity. About 30\% of our sample have kinetic coupling efficiencies >1\%. We find that the majority of the outflows have momentum flux ratios lower than 20 which rules out an energy-conserving nature. Our present work points to the unequivocal existence of a rather short AGN outflow phase, paving the way towards a new avenue to dissect AGN outflows in large samples within eROSITA and beyond. |

|**Abstract**| M82 is an archetypal starburst galaxy in the local Universe. The central burst of star formation, thought to be triggered by M82's interaction with other members in the M81 group, is driving a multiphase galaxy-scale wind away from the plane of the disk that has been studied across the electromagnetic spectrum. Here, we present new velocity-resolved observations of the [CII] 158$\mu$m line in the central disk and the southern outflow of M82 using the upGREAT instrument onboard SOFIA. We also report the first detections of velocity-resolved ($\Delta V = 10$ km s$^{-1}$) [CII] emission in the outflow of M82 at projected distances of $\approx1-2$ kpc south of the galaxy center. We compare the [CII] line profiles to observations of CO and HI and find that likely the majority ($>55$%) of the [CII] emission in the outflow is associated with the neutral atomic medium. We find that the fraction of [CII] actually outflowing from M82 is small compared to the bulk gas outside the midplane (which may be in a halo or tidal streamers), which has important implications for observations of [CII] outflows at higher redshift. Finally, by comparing the observed ratio of the [CII] and CO intensities to models of photodissociation regions, we estimate that the far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field in the disk is $\sim10^{3.5}~G_0$, in agreement with previous estimates. In the outflow, however, the FUV radiation field is 2-3 orders of magnitudes lower, which may explain the high fraction of [CII] arising from the neutral medium in the wind. |

|**Abstract**| Theoretical and observational studies have suggested that ram-pressure stripping by the intracluster medium can be enhanced during cluster interactions, boosting the formation of the "jellyfish" galaxies. In this work, we study the incidence of galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping in 52 clusters of different dynamical states. We use optical data from the WINGS/OmegaWINGS surveys and archival X-ray data to characterise the dynamical state of our cluster sample, applying eight different proxies. We then compute the number of ram-pressure stripping candidates relative to the infalling population of blue late-type galaxies within a fixed circular aperture in each cluster. We find no clear correlation between the fractions of ram-pressure stripping candidates and the different cluster dynamical state proxies considered. These fractions also show no apparent correlation with cluster mass. To construct a dynamical state classification closer to a merging "sequence", we perform a visual classification of the dynamical states of the clusters, combining information available in optical, X-ray, and radio wavelengths. We find a mild increase in the RPS fraction in interacting clusters with respect to all other classes (including post-mergers). This mild enhancement could hint at a short-lived enhanced ram-pressure stripping in ongoing cluster mergers. However, our results are not statistically significant due to the low galaxy numbers. We note this is the first homogeneous attempt to quantify the effect of cluster dynamical state on ram-pressure stripping using a large cluster sample, but even larger (especially wider) multi-wavelength surveys are needed to confirm the results. |

|**Abstract**| The Pierre Auger Collaboration has embraced the concept of open access to their research data since its foundation, with the aim of giving access to the widest possible community. A gradual process of release began as early as 2007 when 1% of the cosmic-ray data was made public, along with 100% of the space-weather information. In February 2021, a portal was released containing 10% of cosmic-ray data collected from 2004 to 2018, during Phase I of the Observatory. The Portal included detailed documentation about the detection and reconstruction procedures, analysis codes that can be easily used and modified and, additionally, visualization tools. Since then the Portal has been updated and extended. In 2023, a catalog of the 100 highest-energy cosmic-ray events examined in depth has been included. A specific section dedicated to educational use has been developed with the expectation that these data will be explored by a wide and diverse community including professional and citizen-scientists, and used for educational and outreach initiatives. This paper describes the context, the spirit and the technical implementation of the release of data by the largest cosmic-ray detector ever built, and anticipates its future developments. |
