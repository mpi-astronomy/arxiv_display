|**Abstract**| We present cosmology results obtained from a blind joint analysis of the abundance, projected clustering, and weak lensing of galaxy clusters measured from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redMaPPer cluster catalog and the Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC) Year3 shape catalog. We present a full-forward model for the cluster observables, which includes empirical modeling for the anisotropic boosts on the lensing and clustering signals of optical clusters. We validate our analysis via mock cluster catalogs which include observational systematics, such as the projection effect and the effect of baryonic feedback, and find that our analysis can robustly constrain cosmological parameters in an unbiased manner without any informative priors on our model parameters. The joint analysis of our observables in the context of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model results in cosmological constraints for $S_8\equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m} / 0.3}=0.816^{+0.041}_{-0.039}$. Our result is consistent with the $S_8$ inference from other cosmic microwave background- and large scale structure-based cosmology analyses, including the result from the \emph{Planck} 2018 primary CMB analysis. |

|**Abstract**| Galaxy cluster mergers are rich sources of information to test cluster astrophysics and cosmology. However, cluster mergers produce complex projected signals that are difficult to interpret physically from individual observational probes. Multi-probe constraints on both the baryonic and dark matter cluster components are necessary to infer merger parameters that are otherwise degenerate. We present ICM-SHOX (Improved Constraints on Mergers with SZ, Hydrodynamical simulations, Optical, and X-ray), a systematic framework to jointly infer multiple merger parameters quantitatively via a pipeline that directly compares a novel combination of multi-probe observables to mock observables derived from hydrodynamical simulations. We report on a first application of the ICM-SHOX pipeline to the MACS J0018.5+1626 system, wherein we systematically examine simulated snapshots characterized by a wide range of initial parameters to constrain the MACS J0018.5+1626 merger parameters. We strongly constrain the observed epoch of MACS J0018.5+1626 to within $\approx -10$--$50$ Myr of the pericenter passage, and the observed viewing angle is inclined $\approx 25$--$38$ degrees from the merger axis. We obtain less precise constraints for the impact parameter ($\approx 100$--250 kpc), the mass ratio ($\approx 1.5$--$3.0$), and the initial relative velocity when the cluster components are separated by 3 Mpc ($\approx 1700$--3000 km s$^{-1}$). The primary and secondary cluster components initially (at 3 Mpc) have gas distributions that are moderately and strongly disturbed, respectively. We further discover a velocity space decoupling of the dark matter and baryonic distributions in MACS J0018.5+1626, which we attribute to the different collisional natures of the two distributions. |

|**Abstract**| Recent experiments show that the desorption energy of H$_2$ on a diamond-like carbon (DLC) surface depends on the H$_2$ coverage of the surface. We aim to quantitatively explain the coverage dependent H$_2$ desorption energy measured by the experiments. We derive a math formula to calculate an effective H$_2$ desorption energy based on the encounter desorption mechanism. The effective H$_2$ desorption energy depends on two key parameters, the desorption energy of H$_2$ on H$_2$ substrate and the ratio of H$_2$ diffusion barrier to its desorption energy. The calculated effective H$_2$ desorption energy qualitatively agrees with the coverage dependent H$_2$ desorption energy measured by the experiments if the values of these two parameters in literature are used in the calculations. We argue that the difference between the effective H$_2$ desorption energy and the experimental results is due to the lacking of knowledge about these two parameters. So, we recalculate these two parameters based on experimental data. Good agreement between theoretical and experimental results can be achieved if these two updated parameters are used in the calculations. |
