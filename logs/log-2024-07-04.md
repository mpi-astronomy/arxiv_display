|**Abstract**|            We present the stellar metallicities and multi-element abundances (C, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Fe) of 15 massive (log M/M$_\odot$=10.2-11.2) quiescent galaxies at z=1-3, derived from ultradeep JWST-SUSPENSE spectra. Compared to quiescent galaxies at z~0, these galaxies exhibit a deficiency of 0.25 dex in [C/H], 0.16 dex in [Fe/H], and 0.07 dex in [Mg/H], implying rapid formation and quenching before significant enrichment from asymptotic giant branch stars and Type Ia supernovae. Additionally, we find that galaxies that form at higher redshift have higher [Mg/Fe] and lower [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], irrespective of their observed redshift. The evolution in [Fe/H] and [C/H] is therefore primarily explained by lower redshift samples naturally including galaxies with longer star-formation timescales. On the other hand, the lower [Mg/H] can be explained by galaxies forming at earlier epochs expelling larger gas reservoirs during their quenching phase. Consequently, the mass-metallicity relation, primarily reflecting [Mg/H], is also lower at z=1-3 compared to the lower redshift relation, though the slopes are similar. Finally, we compare our results to standard stellar population modeling approaches employing solar abundance patterns and non-parametric star-formation histories (using Prospector). Our SSP-equivalent ages agree with the mass-weighted ages from Prospector, while the metallicities disagree significantly. Nonetheless, the metallicities better reflect [Fe/H] than total [Z/H]. We also find that star-formation timescales inferred from elemental abundances are significantly shorter than those from Prospector, and we discuss the resulting implications for the early formation of massive galaxies.         |

|**Abstract**|            CONTEXT: The spectral analysis of hot, massive stars is a fundamental astrophysical method to obtain their intrinsic properties and their feedback. Quantitative spectroscopy for hot, massive stars requires detailed numerical modeling of the atmosphere and an iterative treatment to obtain the best solution within a given framework. AIMS: We present an overview of different techniques for the quantitative spectroscopy of hot stars employed within the X-Shooting ULLYSES collaboration, from grid-based approaches to tailored fits. By performing a blind test, we gain an overview about the similarities and differences of the resulting parameters. Our study aims to provide an overview of the parameter spread caused by different approaches. METHODS: For three different stars from the sample (SMC O5 star AzV 377, LMC O7 star Sk -69 50, and LMC O9 star Sk -66 171), we employ different atmosphere codes (CMFGEN, Fastwind, PoWR) and strategies to determine their best-fitting model. For our analyses, UV and optical spectra are used to derive the properties with some methods relying purely on optical data for comparison. To determine the overall spectral energy distribution, we further employ additional photometry from the literature. RESULTS: Effective temperatures for each of three sample stars agree within 3 kK while the differences in log g can be up to 0.2 dex. Luminosity differences of up to 0.1 dex result from different reddening assumptions, which seem to be larger for the methods employing a genetic algorithm. All sample stars are nitrogen-enriched. CONCLUSIONS: We find a reasonable agreement between the different methods. Tailored fitting tends to be able to minimize discrepancies obtained with more course or automatized treatments. UV spectral data is essential for the determination of realistic wind parameters. For one target (Sk -69 50), we find clear indications of an evolved status.         |

|| J. Kirk, et al. -- incl., <mark>E.-M. Ahrer</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            A primary objective of exoplanet atmosphere characterisation is to learn about planet formation and evolution, however, this is challenged by degeneracies. To determine whether differences in atmospheric composition can be reliably traced to differences in evolution, we are undertaking a new survey with JWST to compare the compositions of a sample of hot Jupiters that orbit F stars above the Kraft break with different orbital alignments. Under the assumption that aligned planets migrate through the inner disc, while misaligned planets migrate after disc dispersal, the act of migrating through the inner disc should lead to a measurable difference in the C/O between aligned and misaligned planets. We expect the amplitude and sign of this difference to depend on the amount of planetesimal accretion and whether silicates accreted from the inner disc release their oxygen. Here, we identify all known exoplanets that are suitable for testing this hypothesis, describe our JWST survey, and use noise simulations and atmospheric retrievals to estimate our survey's sensitivity. With the selected sample of four aligned and four misaligned hot Jupiters, we will be sensitive to the predicted differences in C/O between aligned and misaligned hot Jupiters for a wide range of model scenarios.         |

|**Abstract**|            Hot Jupiters present a unique opportunity for measuring how planet formation history shapes present-day atmospheric composition. However, due to the myriad pathways influencing composition, a well-constructed sample of planets is needed to determine whether formation history can be accurately traced back from atmospheric composition. To this end, the BOWIE-ALIGN survey will compare the compositions of 8 hot Jupiters around F stars, 4 with orbits aligned with the stellar rotation axis and 4 misaligned. Using the alignment as an indicator for planets that underwent disc migration or high-eccentricity migration, one can determine whether migration history produces notable differences in composition between the two samples of planets. This paper describes the planet formation model that motivates our observing programme. Our model traces the accretion of chemical components from the gas and dust in the disc over a broad parameter space to create a full, unbiased model sample from which we can estimate the range of final atmospheric compositions. For high metallicity atmospheres (O/H > 10 times solar), the C/O ratios of aligned and misaligned planets diverge, with aligned planets having lower C/O (< 0.25) due to the accretion of oxygen-rich silicates from the inner disc. However, silicates may rain out instead of releasing their oxygen into the atmosphere. This would significantly increase the C/O of aligned planets (C/O > 0.6), inverting the trend between the aligned and misaligned planets. Nevertheless, by comparing statistically significant samples of aligned and misaligned planets, we expect atmospheric composition to constrain how planets form.         |

|**Abstract**|            Stellar mergers are one important path to highly magnetised stars. Mergers of two low-mass white dwarfs may create up to every third hot subdwarf star. The merging process is usually assumed to dramatically amplify magnetic fields. However, so far only four highly magnetised hot subdwarf stars have been found, suggesting a fraction of less than $1\%$. We present two high-resolution magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of the merger of two helium white dwarfs in a binary system with the same total mass of $0.6\,M_\odot$. We analyse one equal-mass merger with two $0.3\,M_\odot$ white dwarfs, and one unequal-mass merger with a $0.25\,M_\odot$ white dwarf and a $0.35\,M_\odot$ white dwarf. We simulate the inspiral, merger, and further evolution of the merger remnant for about $50$ rotations. We find efficient magnetic field amplification in both mergers via a small-scale dynamo, reproducing previous results of stellar merger simulations. The magnetic field saturates at similar strength for both simulations. We then identify a second phase of magnetic field amplification in both merger remnants that happens on a timescale of several tens of rotational periods of the merger remnant. This phase generates a large-scale ordered azimuthal field. We identify it as a large-scale dynamo driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). Finally, we suggest that in the unequal-mass merger remnant, helium burning will eventually start in a shell around a cold core. The convection zone this generates will coincide with the region that contains most of the magnetic energy, probably erasing the strong, ordered field. The equal-mass merger remnant instead will probably ignite burning in the center, retaining its ordered field. Therefore, the mass ratio of the initial merger could be the selecting factor that decides if a merger remnant will stay highly magnetised long after the merger.         |

|| <mark>U. Chadayammuri</mark>, Á. Bogdán, G. Schellenberger, J. ZuHone |

|**Abstract**|            Abell 2744, also known as Pandora's Cluster, is a complex merging galaxy cluster. While a major merger is clear along the north-south axis, the dynamical state of the northwest subcluster has been highly uncertain. We present ultra-deep ($\approx$2.1 Ms) X-ray observations of Abell 2744 obtained with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and reinterpret the multi-wavelength picture with a suite of idealised simulations of galaxy cluster mergers. The new data reveal in unprecedented detail the disruption of cool cores in the three X-ray luminous subclusters and confirm the presence of a shock to the NW. A position-velocity clustering of the cluster member galaxies shows a clearly separated S2 component, with a $\Delta z$ implying a separation of 53 Mpc or a line-of-sight velocity of $4500\ \rm{km \ s^{-1}}$, or likely some combination of the two. While binary simulations allow NW to have undergone a gravitational slingshot after the first pericenter passage, triple merger simulations rule out this scenario, because the two mergers would have had to occur $\sim$0.5 Gyr apart, and the joint impact of the shocks from the two mergers would completely disrupt the SE and NW cool cores; they only reform after 1-2 Gyr, by which point the core separations greatly exceed observations. The scenario that best describes Abell 2744 is a head-on N-S merger $0.5-0.6$ Gyrs ago followed by a first infall of the NW subcluster. Furthermore, we note that a model with three cluster-size halos, with masses consistent with gravitational lensing constraints, nevertheless produces a lensing convergence and surface brightness lower than observed in most of the field of view, whereas the temperatures are consistent with observations. This suggests the presence of a large-scale overdensity, which contributes to the diffuse emission and total surface density without heating the densest gas.         |

|**Abstract**|            The NOEMA formIng Cluster survEy (NICE) is a large program targeting 69 massive galaxy group candidates at $z>2$ in six deep fields. We report spectroscopic confirmation of eight groups at $1.65\leq z\leq3.61$ in COSMOS. Homogeneously selected as significant overdensities of red IRAC sources with red Herschel colors, four groups are confirmed by CO and [CI] with NOEMA 3mm observations, three are confirmed with ALMA, and one is confirmed by H$\alpha$ from Subaru/FMOS. We constructed the integrated FIR SEDs for the eight groups, obtaining total IR SFR $=260-1300~{\rm M_\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$. We adopted six methods to estimate the dark matter masses, including stellar mass to halo mass relations, overdensity with galaxy bias, and NFW profile fitting to radial stellar mass density. We found the radial stellar mass density are consistent with a NFW profile, supporting that they are collapsed structures hosted by a single dark matter halo. The best halo mass estimates are $\log(M_{\rm h}/{\rm M_\odot})=12.8-13.7$ with uncertainty of 0.3 dex. From halo mass estimates, we derive baryonic accretion rate ${\rm BAR}=(1-8)\times10^{3}\,{\rm M_{\odot}/yr}$ for this sample. We find a quasi-linear correlation between the integrated SFR/BAR and the theoretical halo mass limit for cold streams, $M_{\rm stream}/M_{\rm h}$, with ${\rm SFR/BAR}=10^{-0.46\pm0.22}\left({M_{\rm stream}/M_{\rm h}}\right)^{0.71\pm0.16}$ with a scatter of $0.40\,{\rm dex}$. Further, we compare halo masses and stellar masses with simulations, and find all structures are consistent with being progenitors of $M_{\rm h}(z=0)>10^{14}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ galaxy clusters, and the most massive central galaxies have stellar masses consistent with brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) progenitors in the TNG300 simulation. The results strongly suggest these structures are forming massive galaxy clusters via baryonic and dark matter accretion.         |
