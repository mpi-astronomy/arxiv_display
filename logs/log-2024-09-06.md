|**Abstract**|            To constrain models beyond $\Lambda$CDM, the development of the Euclid analysis pipeline requires simulations that capture the nonlinear phenomenology of such models. We present an overview of numerical methods and $N$-body simulation codes developed to study the nonlinear regime of structure formation in alternative dark energy and modified gravity theories. We review a variety of numerical techniques and approximations employed in cosmological $N$-body simulations to model the complex phenomenology of scenarios beyond $\Lambda$CDM. This includes discussions on solving nonlinear field equations, accounting for fifth forces, and implementing screening mechanisms. Furthermore, we conduct a code comparison exercise to assess the reliability and convergence of different simulation codes across a range of models. Our analysis demonstrates a high degree of agreement among the outputs of different simulation codes, providing confidence in current numerical methods for modelling cosmic structure formation beyond $\Lambda$CDM. We highlight recent advances made in simulating the nonlinear scales of structure formation, which are essential for leveraging the full scientific potential of the forthcoming observational data from the Euclid mission.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Euclid mission will measure cosmological parameters with unprecedented precision. To distinguish between cosmological models, it is essential to generate realistic mock observables from cosmological simulations that were run in both the standard $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm and in many non-standard models beyond $\Lambda$CDM. We present the scientific results from a suite of cosmological N-body simulations using non-standard models including dynamical dark energy, k-essence, interacting dark energy, modified gravity, massive neutrinos, and primordial non-Gaussianities. We investigate how these models affect the large-scale-structure formation and evolution in addition to providing synthetic observables that can be used to test and constrain these models with Euclid data. We developed a custom pipeline based on the Rockstar halo finder and the nbodykit large-scale structure toolkit to analyse the particle output of non-standard simulations and generate mock observables such as halo and void catalogues, mass density fields, and power spectra in a consistent way. We compare these observables with those from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and quantify the deviations. We find that non-standard cosmological models can leave significant imprints on the synthetic observables that we have generated. Our results demonstrate that non-standard cosmological N-body simulations provide valuable insights into the physics of dark energy and dark matter, which is essential to maximising the scientific return of Euclid.         |

|**Abstract**|            We study the constraint on $f(R)$ gravity that can be obtained by photometric primary probes of the Euclid mission. Our focus is the dependence of the constraint on the theoretical modelling of the nonlinear matter power spectrum. In the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model, we consider four different predictions for the ratio between the power spectrum in $f(R)$ and that in $\Lambda$CDM: a fitting formula, the halo model reaction approach, ReACT and two emulators based on dark matter only $N$-body simulations, FORGE and e-Mantis. These predictions are added to the MontePython implementation to predict the angular power spectra for weak lensing (WL), photometric galaxy clustering and their cross-correlation. By running Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we compare constraints on parameters and investigate the bias of the recovered $f(R)$ parameter if the data are created by a different model. For the pessimistic setting of WL, one dimensional bias for the $f(R)$ parameter, $\log_{10}|f_{R0}|$, is found to be $0.5 \sigma$ when FORGE is used to create the synthetic data with $\log_{10}|f_{R0}| =-5.301$ and fitted by e-Mantis. The impact of baryonic physics on WL is studied by using a baryonification emulator BCemu. For the optimistic setting, the $f(R)$ parameter and two main baryon parameters are well constrained despite the degeneracies among these parameters. However, the difference in the nonlinear dark matter prediction can be compensated by the adjustment of baryon parameters, and the one-dimensional marginalised constraint on $\log_{10}|f_{R0}|$ is biased. This bias can be avoided in the pessimistic setting at the expense of weaker constraints. For the pessimistic setting, using the $\Lambda$CDM synthetic data for WL, we obtain the prior-independent upper limit of $\log_{10}|f_{R0}|< -5.6$. Finally, we implement a method to include theoretical errors to avoid the bias.         |

|**Abstract**|            According to the well established hierarchical framework for galaxy evolution, galaxies grow through mergers with other galaxies and the LambdaCDM cosmological model predicts that the stellar halos of galaxies are rich in remnants from minor mergers. The Stellar Streams Legacy Survey has provided a first release of a catalogue with a statistically significant sample of stellar streams in the Local Universe that can be used to study minor mergers and test the cosmological models. The main objective is to compare the results of the observations of stellar tidal streams with the predictions of state-of-the-art cosmological simulations regarding the formation of stellar streams up to a redshift z < 0.02, according to the LambdaCDM model. We use the predictions of the cosmological simulations Copernicus Complexio, TNG50 of the IllustrisTNG project and Auriga to generate 225 mock-images of nearby halos at a distance of 70 Mpc, and search for stellar streams. We compare the obtained stream frequency and characteristics with those obtained from the Stellar Streams Legacy Survey. We find good agreement between the results of analysing real images from the Dark Energy Survey and mock-images from cosmological simulations. We obtained predictions for the detection rate of stellar streams to a surface brightness limit of 35 mag arcsec^-2. The cosmological simulations predict that for a surface brightness limit of 32 mag arcsec^-2 a frequency of almost 70% in the detection of streams around galaxies can be achieved.         |

|| J. Dou, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-09-06*|

|**Abstract**|            The cold interstellar medium (ISM) as the raw material for star formation is critical to understanding galaxy evolution. It is generally understood that galaxies stop making stars when, in one way or another, they run out of gas. However, here we provide evidence that central spiral galaxies remain rich in atomic gas even if their star formation rate and molecular gas fraction have dropped significantly compared to "normal" star-forming galaxies of the same mass. Since HI is sensitive to external processes, here we investigate central spiral galaxies using a combined sample from SDSS, ALFALFA, and xGASS surveys. After proper incompleteness corrections, we find that the key HI scaling relations for central spirals show significant but regular systematic dependence on stellar mass. At any given stellar mass, the HI gas mass fraction is about constant with changing specific star formation rate (sSFR), which suggests that HI reservoir is ubiquitous in central spirals with any star formation status down to M* ~ 10^9 Msun. Together with the tight correlation between the molecular gas mass fraction and sSFR for galaxies across a wide range of different properties, it suggests that the decline of SFR of all central spirals in the local universe is due to the halt of H2 supply, though there is plenty of HI gas around. These hence provide critical observations of the dramatically different behavior of the cold multi-phase ISM, and a key to understand the star formation process and quenching mechanism.         |

|**Abstract**|            As part of our comprehensive, ongoing characterisation of the low-mass end of the main sequence in the Solar neighbourhood, we used the OSIRIS instrument at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias to acquire low- and mid-resolution (R$\approx$300 and R$\approx$2500) optical spectroscopy of 53 late-M and L ultracool dwarfs. Most of these objects are known but poorly investigated and lacking complete kinematics. We measured spectral indices, determined spectral types (six of which are new) and inferred effective temperature and surface gravity from BT-Settl synthetic spectra fits for all objects. We were able to measure radial velocities via line centre fitting and cross correlation for 46 objects, 29 of which lacked previous radial velocity measurements. Using these radial velocities in combination with the latest Gaia DR3 data, we also calculated Galactocentric space velocities. From their kinematics, we identified two candidates outside of the thin disc and four in young stellar kinematic groups. Two further ultracool dwarfs are apparently young field objects: 2MASSW J1246467$+$402715 (L4$\beta$), which has a potential, weak lithium absorption line, and G 196$-$3B (L3$\beta$), which was already known as young due to its well-studied primary companion.         |
