|**Abstract**|            The Euclid survey aims to measure the spectroscopic redshift of emission-line galaxies by identifying the H$\,{\alpha}$ line in their slitless spectra. This method is sensitive to the signal-to-noise ratio of the line, as noise fluctuations or other strong emission lines can be misidentified as H$\,{\alpha}$, depending on redshift. These effects lead to catastrophic redshift errors and the inclusion of interlopers in the sample. We forecast the impact of such redshift errors on galaxy clustering measurements. In particular, we study the effect of interloper contamination on the two-point correlation function (2PCF), the growth rate of structures, and the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) parameters. We analyze 1000 synthetic spectroscopic catalogues, the EuclidLargeMocks, designed to match the area and selection function of the Data Release 1 (DR1) sample. We estimate the 2PCF of the contaminated catalogues, isolating contributions from correctly identified galaxies and from interlopers. We explore different models with increasing complexity to describe the measured 2PCF at fixed cosmology. Finally, we perform a cosmological inference and evaluate the systematic error on the inferred $f\sigma_8$, $\alpha_{\parallel}$ and $\alpha_{\perp}$ values associated with different models. Our results demonstrate that a minimal modelling approach, which only accounts for an attenuation of the clustering signal regardless of the type of contaminants, is sufficient to recover the correct values of $f\sigma_8$, $\alpha_{\parallel}$, and $\alpha_{\perp}$ at DR1. The accuracy and precision of the estimated AP parameters are largely insensitive to the presence of interlopers. The adoption of a minimal model induces a 1%-3% systematic error on the growth rate of structure estimation, depending on the redshift. However, this error remains smaller than the statistical error expected for the Euclid DR1 analysis.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present an analysis of the H$\alpha$-emitting ionized gas in the warm phase of the NGC 253 outflow using integral field spectroscopy from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). In each spaxel, we decompose H$\alpha$, [N II], and [S II] emission lines into a system of up to 3 Gaussian components, accounting for the velocity contributions due to the disk and both intercepted walls of an outflow cone. In the approaching southern lobe of the outflow, we find maximum deprojected outflow velocities down to ~ -500 km/s. Velocity gradients of this outflowing gas range from ~ -350 to -550 km/s/kpc with increasing distance from the nucleus. Additionally, [N II]/H$\alpha$ and [S II]/H$\alpha$ integrated line ratios are suggestive of shocks as the dominant ionization source throughout the wind. Electron densities, inferred from the [S II] doublet, peak at 2100 cm$^{-3}$ near the nucleus and reach $\lesssim 50 $cm$^{-3}$ in the wind. Finally, at an uncertainty of 0.3 dex on the inferred mass of $4\times10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$, the mass-outflow rate of the H$\alpha$-emitting gas in the southern outflow lobe is ~ 0.4 M$_{\odot}$/year. This yields a mass-loading factor of $\eta$ ~ 0.1 and a ~ 2% starburst energy efficiency.         |

|**Abstract**|            We employed the Fast Folding Algorithm (FFA) on L-Band Globular Cluster (GC) observations taken with Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to search for new pulsars, especially those with a long rotational period. We conducted a search across 16 GCs that collectively host 93 known pulsars, as well as 14 GCs that do not contain any known pulsars. The majority of these known pulsars were successfully re-detected in our survey. The few non-detections could be attributed to the high accelerations of these pulsars. Additionally, we have discovered a new binary millisecond pulsar, namely M13I (or PSR J1641+3627I) in GC M13 (or NGC 6205), and obtained its phase-coherent timing solution using observations spanning 6 years. M13I has a spin period of 6.37 ms, and an orbital period of 18.23 days. The eccentricity of the binary orbit is 0.064, with a companion mass range of approximately 0.45 to 1.37 M$_{\odot}$. The orbital properties of M13I are remarkably different from those of the other known pulsars in M13, indicating that this pulsar has undergone a different evolutionary path compared to the rest.         |
