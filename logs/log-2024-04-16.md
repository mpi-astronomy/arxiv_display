|**Abstract**| Signposts of early planet formation are ubiquitous in sub-structured young discs. Dense, hot and high-pressure regions formed during gravitational collapse process, integral to star formation, facilitate dynamical mixing of dust within the protostellar disc. This provides an incentive to constrain the role of gas-dust interaction and resolve zones of dust concentration during star-disc formation. We explore if thermal and dynamical conditions developed during disc formation can generate gas flows that efficiently mix and transport well-coupled gas and dust components. We simulate the collapse of dusty molecular cloud cores with the hydrodynamics code PLUTO augmented with radiation transport and self-gravity. We use a 2D axisymmetric geometry and follow the azimuthal component of velocity. Dust is treated as Lagrangian particles that are subject to drag from the gas, whose motion is computed on a Eulerian grid. We consider 1, 10 and 100 micron-sized neutral spherical dust. Importantly, the equation of state accurately includes molecular hydrogen dissociation. We focus on molecular cloud core masses of 1 and 3 Msun and explore effects of initial rotation rates and cloud core sizes. Our study underlines mechanisms for early transport of dust from inner hot disc regions via the occurrence of meridional flows and outflow. The vortical flow fosters dynamical mixing and retention of dust, while thermal pressure driven outflow replenishes dust in the outer disc. Young dynamical precursors to planet-forming discs exhibit regions with complex hydrodynamical gas features and high-temperature structures. These can play a crucial role in concentrating dust for subsequent growth into protoplanets. Dust transport, especially, from sub-au scales surrounding the protostar to outer relatively cooler parts, offers an efficient pathway for thermal reprocessing during pre-stellar core collapse.

|**Abstract**| We present a statistical study of the properties of diffuse HI in ten nearby galaxies, comparing the HI detected by the single-dish telescope FAST (FEASTS program) and the interferometer VLA (THINGS program), respectively. The THINGS' observation missed HI with a median of 23% due to the short-spacing problem of interferometry and limited sensitivity. We extract the diffuse HI by subtracting the dense HI, which is obtained from the THINGS data with a uniform flux-density threshold, from the total HI detected by FAST. Among the sample, the median diffuse-HI fraction is 34%, and more diffuse HI is found in galaxies exhibiting more prominent tidal-interaction signatures. The diffuse HI we detected seems to be distributed in disk-like layers within a typical thickness of $1\,\text{kpc}$, different from the more halo-like diffuse HI detected around NGC 4631 in a previous study. Most of the diffuse HI is cospatial with the dense HI and has a typical column density of $10^{17.7}$-$10^{20.1}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$. The diffuse and dense HI exhibits a similar rotational motion, but the former lags by a median of 25% in at least the inner disks, and its velocity dispersions are typically twice as high. Based on a simplified estimation of circum-galactic medium properties and assuming pressure equilibrium, the volume density of diffuse HI appears to be constant within each individual galaxy, implying its role as a cooling interface. Comparing with existing models, these results are consistent with a possible link between tidal interactions, the formation of diffuse HI, and gas accretion. |

|**Abstract**| Past studies have long emphasised the key role played by galactic stellar bars in the context of disc secular evolution, via the redistribution of gas and stars, the triggering of star formation, and the formation of prominent structures such as rings and central mass concentrations. However, the exact physical processes acting on those structures, as well as the timescales associated with the building and consumption of central gas reservoirs are still not well understood. We are building a suite of hydro-dynamical RAMSES simulations of isolated, low-redshift galaxies that mimic the properties of the PHANGS sample. The initial conditions of the models reproduce the observed stellar mass, disc scale length, or gas fraction, and this paper presents a first subset of these models. Most of our simulated galaxies develop a prominent bar structure, which itself triggers central gas fuelling and the building of an over-density with a typical scale of 100-1000 pc. We confirm that if the host galaxy features an ellipsoidal component, the formation of the bar and gas fuelling are delayed. We show that most of our simulations follow a common time evolution, when accounting for mass scaling and the bar formation time. In our simulations, the stellar mass of $10^{10}$~M$_{\odot}$ seems to mark a change in the phases describing the time evolution of the bar and its impact on the interstellar medium. In massive discs (M$_{\star} \geq 10^{10}$~M$_{\odot}$), we observe the formation of a central gas reservoir with star formation mostly occurring within a restricted starburst region, leading to a gas depletion phase. Lower-mass systems (M$_{\star} < 10^{10}$~M$_{\odot}$) do not exhibit such a depletion phase, and show a more homogeneous spread of star-forming regions along the bar structure, and do not appear to host inner bar-driven discs or rings. |

|| D. Powell, <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-04-16*|
|*Comments*| *accepted to Ap*|
|**Abstract**| We present a new two-dimensional, bin-scheme microphysical model of cloud formation in the atmospheres of hot Jupiters that includes the effects of longitudinal gas and cloud transport. We predict cloud particle size distributions as a function of planetary longitude and atmospheric height for a grid of hot Jupiters with equilibrium temperatures ranging from 1000-2100 K. The predicted 2D cloud distributions vary significantly from models that do not consider horizontal cloud transport and we discuss the microphysical and transport timescales that give rise to the differences in 2D versus 1D models. We find that the horizontal advection of cloud particles increases the cloud formation efficiency for nearly all cloud species and homogenizes cloud distributions across the planets in our model grid. In 2D models, certain cloud species are able to be transported and survive on the daysides of hot Jupiters in cases where 1D models would not predict the existence of clouds. We demonstrate that the depletion of condensible gas species varies as a function of longitude and atmospheric height across the planet, which impacts the resultant gas-phase chemistry. Finally, we discuss various model sensitivities including the sensitivity of cloud properties to microphysical parameters, which we find to be substantially less than the sensitivity to the atmospheric thermal structure and horizontal and vertical transport of condensible material. |

|**Abstract**| IW And-type dwarf novae are anomalous Z Cam stars featured with outbursts happening during standstill states, which are not expected in the standard disk instability model. The physical mechanisms for these variations remain unclear. In this study, we report the discovery of a new candidate IW And-type dwarf nova J0652+2436, identified with its frequent outbursts from the slowly rising standstill states. Luckily, the TESS observations during a long standstill state and the earlier K2 observations give a chance to find the orbital and negative superhump period in the light curve of J0652+2436, allowing the measurement of its mass ratio of 0.366. This mass ratio is marginally possible for the tidal instability to set in according to previous SPH simulations. Thus, we propose that the outbursts in J0652+2436 are likely to be caused by the growing accretion disk during standstills, in favor of the previous hypothesis of the mechanisms lying in all IW And stars. We conclude that J0652+2436 might be the first IW And star with both a precessing tilted disk and tidal instability, which will be an important laboratory for studying the accretion disk dynamics and help understand IW And phenomenon. |
