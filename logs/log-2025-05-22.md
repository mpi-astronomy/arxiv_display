|**Abstract**|            Galaxy evolution is driven by spatially distributed processes with varying timescales. Integral field spectroscopy provides spatially-resolved information about these processes. Nevertheless, disentangling these processes, which are related to both the underlying stellar populations and the interstellar medium can be challenging. We present a case study on NGC~613, observed with MUSE (Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) for the TIMER (Time Inference with MUSE in Extragalactic Rings) project, a local barred galaxy, which shows several gas ionisation mechanisms and is rich in both large and inner-scale stellar structures. We develop a set of steps to overcome fundamental problems in the modelling of emission lines with multiple components, together with the characterisation of the stellar populations. That results in the disentanglement of the gas ionisation mechanisms and kinematics, along with an optimal parametrisation for star formation history recovery. Our analysis reveals evidence of gas inflows, which are associated with the bar dust lanes traced with \textit{Hubble} Space Telescope (HST). In addition, we show the gas kinematics in a central biconical outflow, which is aligned with a radio jet observed with Very Large Array (VLA). The emission line provides estimates of electron density, gas-phase metallicity, and the mass outflow rate, allowing us to distinguish intertwined ionisation mechanisms and to identify a part of the multiphase gas cycle in NGC 613. It traces the gas kinematics from the bar lanes to inner scale gas reservoirs, where it can eventually trigger star formation or AGN activity, as observed in the outflow.         |

|**Abstract**|            Millimetre-compact dust disks are thought to have efficient radial drift of icy dust pebbles, which has been hypothesised to produce an enhanced cold ($T<$400 K) H$_2$O reservoir in their inner disks. Mid-infrared spectral surveys, now with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), pave the way to explore this hypothesis. In this work, we test this theory for 8 compact disks ($R_\mathrm{dust}<$60 au) with JWST-MIRI/MRS observations. We analyse the different reservoirs that can be probed with the pure rotational lines ($>$10 $\mathrm{\mu}$m) through parametric column density profiles, multiple component slab models, and line flux ratios. We find that not all compact disks show strong enhancements of the cold H$_2$O reservoir, instead we propose three different classes of inner disk H$_2$O distributions. Four of our disks appear to have similar H$_2$O distributions as many of the large and structured disks (Type N or ``Normal'' disks), as is indicated by the slab model fitting and the line flux ratios. These disks have a small cold reservoir, suggesting the inward drift of dust, but it is not as efficient as hypothesised before. Only two disks do show a strong enhancement of the cold H$_2$O emission (Type E or cold H$_2$O enhanced disks), agreeing with the original hypothesis. The two remaining disks are found to be very H$_2$O-poor (Type P or H$_2$O-poor disks), yet show emission from either the hot or immediate reservoirs (depending on the fit) in addition to emission from the cold one. We find that different parametrisations are able to provide a good description of the observed H$_2$O spectra, with the multiple component analysis yielding similar results. Finally, we also report the detection of other molecules in these disks, including a tentative detection of CH$_4$ in CY Tau.         |

|**Abstract**|            We update our stellar population models for the time evolution of the number and mass of massive remnants - neutron stars and black holes - with a new initial mass-remnant mass relation for core collapse supernovae. The calculations are based on hydrodynamical simulations and induced explosions of a subset of previously published pre-supernovae models spanning a wide range of stellar mass, metallicity and different values for rotation velocity. The resulting stellar population models predict lower numbers of neutron stars (by up to 0.3 dex) and higher numbers of black holes (by up to 0.8 dex), especially when stellar rotation is considered. The mass fraction locked in neutron stars and black holes is lowest in high-metallicity populations, with the largest number of remnants found at about half-solar metallicity. This mirrors the amount of available gas, ranging from 35 per cent to 45 per cent. We then apply our new models to IFU spectra for ~10,000 galaxies from the SDSS-IV/MaNGA survey for which we previously published spatially-resolved star formation histories. This allows us to probe spatially-resolved graveyards in galaxies of different types. The number and radial distribution of remnants depend on a galaxy's mass, star formation history and metal content. More massive and hence more metal-rich galaxies are found to host fewer remnants. Radial gradients in the number of remnants depend on galaxy mass mostly because of the mass-dependent profiles in mass density: the gradients are flat in low-mass galaxies, and negative in high-mass galaxies, particularly in Milky Way analogues.         |

|| N. Yamaguchi, <mark>K. El-Badry</mark>, S. Shahaf |

|**Abstract**|            Astrometry from the Gaia mission has revealed a large population of white dwarf (WD) + main sequence (MS) binaries with periods of $100 - 1000\,$d. Such systems have separations intermediate to predictions from standard binary evolution scenarios, challenging models of binary interaction and mass transfer. Because the selection function of Gaia astrometric catalogs is complex, the underlying population demographics of WD+MS binaries remain imperfectly understood. We present a forward-model of the au-scale WD+MS binary population probed by Gaia that begins with a realistic binary population and incorporates a full model of Gaia mock observations and astrometric model fitting, as well as cuts employed in producing the Gaia astrometric catalog and selecting WD+MS binary candidates. Our model allows us to constrain the intrinsic population demographics of intermediate-separation WD+MS binaries. The inferred period distribution is close to flat, with ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}P_{\rm orb}\propto P_{\rm orb}^{-0.25}$, while the WD mass distribution is sharply peaked at $0.6\,M_{\odot}$. We model the formation of au-scale WD+MS binaries as the result of interaction when the WD progenitor is an AGB star. Explaining the mass distributions of both components requires two key assumptions: (1) the mass growth of the WD is terminated when its AGB progenitor overflows its Roche lobe, and (2) post-AGB binaries binaries remain wide only if the accretor-to-donor mass ratio exceeds a critical threshold, $q_{\rm crit} \approx 0.4$. Systems with more unequal mass ratios likely shrink to shorter periods and become classical post-common envelope binaries or merge. The model implies that $\sim 1\%$ of solar-type stars have WD companions with periods of $100 - 1000\,$d, consistent with complementary constraints from self-lensing binaries.         |

|| S. Cheng, <mark>J. Li</mark>, E. Yang |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-05-22*|
|*Comments*| *6 pages, 6 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            We report the discovery of a dwarf planet candidate, 2017 OF201, currently located at a distance of 90.5 au. Its orbit is extremely wide and extends to the inner Oort cloud, with a semi-major axis of 838 au and a perihelion of 44.9 au precisely determined from 19 observations over seven years. Assuming a typical albedo of 0.15, we estimate a diameter about 700 km, making it the second-largest known object in this dynamical population and a likely dwarf planet. Its high eccentricity suggests that it is part of a broader, unseen population of similar objects totaling about 1 % of Earth's mass. Notably, the orbit of 2017 OF201 lies well outside the clustering of longitude of perihelion observed in extreme trans-Neptunian objects, which has been proposed as dynamical evidence for a distant, undetected planet.         |
