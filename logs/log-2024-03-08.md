|**Abstract**| Context: Magnetic fields can play crucial roles in high-mass star formation. Nonetheless, the significance of magnetic fields at various scales and their relationship with gas structures is largely overlooked. Aims: Our goal is to examine the relationship between the magnetic field and molecular gas structures within the Orion A giant molecular cloud at different scales and density regimes. Methods: We assess the gas intensity structures and column densities in Orion A by utilizing $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O from Nobeyama observations. Through comparing Nobeyama observations with {\it{Planck}} polarization observations on large scales ($\sim0.6$ pc) and JCMT polarization observations on small scales ($\sim0.04$ pc), we investigate how the role of magnetic fields change with scale and density. Results: We find a similar trend from parallel to perpendicular alignment with increasing column densities in Orion A at both large and small spatial scales. Besides, when changing from low-density to high-density tracers, the relative orientation preference changes from random to perpendicular. The self-similar results at different scales indicate that magnetic fields are dynamically important in both cloud formation and filament formation. However, magnetic fields properties at small scales are relative complicated, and the interplay between magnetic field and star-forming activities needs to be discussed case-by-case. |

|**Abstract**| To increase the number of sources with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) astrometry available for comparison with the Gaia results, we have observed 31 young stars with recently reported radio emission. These stars are all in the Gaia DR3 catalog and were suggested, on the basis of conventional interferometry observations, to be non-thermal radio emitters and, therefore, good candidates for VLBI detections. The observations were carried out with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at two epochs separated by a few days and yielded 10 detections (a $\sim$30\% detection rate). Using the astrometric Gaia results, we have extrapolated the target positions to the epochs of our radio observations and compared them with the position of the radio sources. For seven objects, the optical and radio positions are coincident within five times their combined position errors. Three targets, however, have position discrepancies above eight times the position errors, indicating different emitting sources at optical and radio wavelengths. In one case, the VLBA emission is very likely associated with a known companion of the primary target. In the other two cases, we associate the VLBA emission with previously unknown companions, but further observations will be needed to confirm this. |

|**Abstract**| In the classical grouping of large magnitude episodic variability of young accreting stars, FUORs outshine their stars by a factor of $\sim$ 100, and can last for up to centuries; EXORs are dimmer, and last months to a year. A disc Hydrogen ionisation Thermal Instability (TI) scenario was previously proposed for FUORs but required unrealistically low disc viscosity. In the last decade, many intermediate type objects, e.g., FUOR-like in luminosity and spectra but EXOR-like in duration were found. Here we show that the intermediate type bursters Gaia20eae, PTF14jg, Gaia19bey and Gaia21bty may be naturally explained by the TI scenario with realistic viscosity values. We argue that TI predicts a dearth (desert) of bursts with peak accretion rates between $\dot M \sim 10^{-6} M_\odot$/yr and $\dot M \sim 10^{-5} M_\odot$/yr, and that this desert is seen in the sample of all the bursters with previously determined $\dot M$ burst. Most classic EXORs (FUORs) appear to be on the cold (hot) branch of the S-curve during the peak light of their eruptions; thus TI may play a role in this class differentiation. At the same time, TI is unable to explain how classic FUORs can last for up to centuries, and over-predicts the occurrence rate of short FUORs by at least an order of magnitude. We conclude that TI is a required ingredient of episodic accretion operating at R < 0.1 au, but additional physics must play a role at larger scales. Knowledge of TI inner workings from related disciplines may enable its use as a tool to constrain the nature of this additional physics. |

|**Abstract**| In our Galactic Center, about 10,000 to 100,000 stars are estimated to have survived tidal disruption events, resulting in partially disrupted remnants. These events occur when a supermassive black hole (SMBH) tidally interacts with a star, but not enough to completely disrupt the star. We use the 1D stellar evolution code Kepler and the 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics code Phantom to model the tidal disruption of 1, 3, and 10 solar mass stars at zero-age (ZAMS), middle-age (MAMS), and terminal-age main-sequence (TAMS). We map the disruption remnants into Kepler in order to understand their post-distribution evolution. We find distinct characteristics in the remnants, including increased radius, rapid core rotation, and differential rotation in the envelope. The remnants undergo composition mixing that affects their stellar evolution. Whereas the remnants formed by disruption of ZAMS models evolve similarly to unperturbed models of the same mass, for MAMS and TAMS stars, the remnants have higher luminosity and effective temperature. Potential observational signatures include peculiarities in nitrogen and carbon abundances, higher luminosity, rapid rotation, faster evolution, and unique tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram |

|**Abstract**| The Gaia celestial reference frame (Gaia-CRF) will benefit from a close assessment with independent methods, such as Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measurements of radio stars at bright magnitudes. However, obtaining full astrometric parameters for each radio star through VLBI measurements demands a significant amount of observation time. This study proposes an efficient observing strategy that acquires double-epoch VLBI positions to measure the positions and proper motions of radio stars at a reduced cost. The solution for CRF link compatible with individual VLBI position measurements is introduced, and the optimized observing epoch scheduling is discussed. Applying this solution to observational data yields results sensitive to sample increase or decrease, yet they remain consistently in line with the literature at the 1-sigma level. This suggests the potential for improvement with a larger sample size. Simulations for adding observations demonstrate the double-epoch strategy reduces CRF link parameter uncertainties by over 30% compared to the five-parameter strategy. |

|**Abstract**| Our aim in this paper is to refine the orbital and physical parameters of the HATS-2 planetary system and study transit timing variations and atmospheric composition thanks to transit observations that span more than ten years and that were collected using different instruments and pass-band filters. We also investigate the orbital alignment of the system by studying the anomalies in the transit light curves induced by starspots on the photosphere of the parent star. We analysed new transit events from both ground-based telescopes and NASA's TESS mission. Anomalies were detected in most of the light curves and modelled as starspots occulted by the planet during transit events. We fitted the clean and symmetric light curves with the JKTEBOP code and those affected by anomalies with the PRISM+GEMC codes to simultaneously model the photometric parameters of the transits and the position, size, and contrast of each starspot. We found consistency between the values we found for the physical and orbital parameters and those from the discovery paper and ATLAS9 stellar atmospherical models. We identified different sets of consecutive starspot-crossing events that temporally occurred in less than five days. Under the hypothesis that we are dealing with the same starspots, occulted twice by the planet during two consecutive transits, we estimated the rotational period of the parent star and, in turn the projected and the true orbital obliquity of the planet. We find that the system is well aligned. We identified the possible presence of transit timing variations in the system, which can be caused by tidal orbital decay, and we derived a low-resolution transmission spectrum. |

|**Abstract**| The nearby Supernova 1987A was accompanied by a burst of neutrino emission, which indicates that a compact object (a neutron star or black hole) was formed in the explosion. There has been no direct observation of this compact object. In this work, we observe the supernova remnant with JWST spectroscopy finding narrow infrared emission lines of argon and sulphur. The line emission is spatially unresolved and blueshifted in velocity relative to the supernova rest frame. We interpret the lines as gas illuminated by a source of ionizing photons located close to the center of the expanding ejecta. Photoionization models show that the line ratios are consistent with ionization by a cooling neutron star or pulsar wind nebula. The velocity shift could be evidence for a neutron star natal kick. |
