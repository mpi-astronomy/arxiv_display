|**Abstract**| We report the discovery of ZTF J0127+5258, a compact mass-transferring binary with an orbital period of 13.7 minutes. The system contains a white dwarf accretor, which likely originated as a post-common envelope carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarf, and a warm donor ($T_{\rm eff,\,donor}= 16,400\pm1000\,\rm K$). The donor probably formed during a common envelope phase between the CO white dwarf and an evolving giant which left behind a helium star or helium white dwarf in a close orbit with the CO white dwarf. We measure gravitational wave-driven orbital inspiral with $\sim 35\sigma$ significance, which yields a joint constraint on the component masses and mass transfer rate. While the accretion disk in the system is dominated by ionized helium emission, the donor exhibits a mixture of hydrogen and helium absorption lines. Phase-resolved spectroscopy yields a donor radial-velocity semi-amplitude of $771\pm27\,\rm km\, s^{-1}$, and high-speed photometry reveals that the system is eclipsing. We detect a {\it Chandra} X-ray counterpart with $L_{X}\sim 3\times 10^{31}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. Depending on the mass-transfer rate, the system will likely evolve into either a stably mass-transferring helium CV, merge to become an R Crb star, or explode as a Type Ia supernova in the next million years. We predict that the Laser Space Interferometer Antenna (LISA) will detect the source with a signal-to-noise ratio of $24\pm6$ after 4 years of observations. The system is the first \emph{LISA}-loud mass-transferring binary with an intrinsically luminous donor, a class of sources that provide the opportunity to leverage the synergy between optical and infrared time domain surveys, X-ray facilities, and gravitational-wave observatories to probe general relativity, accretion physics, and binary evolution. |

|**Abstract**| Analyzing resolved stellar populations across the disk of a galaxy can provide unique insights into how that galaxy assembled its stellar mass over its lifetime. Previous work at ~1 kpc resolution has already revealed common features in the mass buildup (e.g., inside-out growth of galaxies). However, even at approximate kpc scales, the stellar populations are blurred between the different galactic morphological structures such as spiral arms, bars and bulges. Here we present a detailed analysis of the spatially resolved star formation histories (SFHs) of 19 PHANGS-MUSE galaxies, at a spatial resolution of ~100 pc. We show that our sample of local galaxies exhibits predominantly negative radial gradients of stellar age and [Z/H], consistent with previous findings, and a radial structure that is primarily consistent with local star formation, and indicative of inside-out formation. In barred galaxies, we find flatter [Z/H] gradients along the semi-major axis of the bar than along the semi-minor axis, as is expected from the radial mixing of material along the bar. In general, the derived assembly histories of the galaxies in our sample tell a consistent story of inside-out growth, where low-mass galaxies assembled the majority of their stellar mass later in cosmic history than high-mass galaxies. We also show how stellar populations of different ages exhibit different kinematics, with younger stellar populations having lower velocity dispersions than older stellar populations at similar galactocentric distances, which we interpret as an imprint of the progressive dynamical heating of stellar populations as they age. Finally, we explore how the time-averaged star formation rate evolves with time, and how it varies across galactic disks. This analysis reveals a wide variation of the SFHs of galaxy centers and additionally shows that structural features become less pronounced with age. |

|**Abstract**| Hot Jupiters, particularly those with temperature higher than 2000\,K are the best sample of planets that allow in-depth characterization of their atmospheres. We present here a thermal emission study of the ultra hot Jupiter WASP\mbox{-}103\,b observed in two secondary eclipses with CFHT/WIRCam in $J$ and $K_{\rm s}$ bands. By means of high precision differential photometry, we determine eclipse depths in $J$ and $K_{\rm s}$ to an accuracy of 220 and 270\,ppm, which are combined with the published HST/WFC3 and Spitzer data to retrieve a joint constraints on the properties of WASP-103\,b dayside atmosphere. We find that the atmosphere is best fit with a thermal inversion layer included. The equilibrium chemistry retrieval indicates an enhanced C/O (1.35$^{+0.14}_{-0.17}$) and a super metallicity with [Fe/H]$=2.19^{+0.51}_{-0.63}$ composition. Given the near-solar metallicity of WASP-103 of [Fe/H]=0.06, this planet seems to be $\sim$100 more abundant than its host star. The free chemistry retrieval analysis yields a large abundance of FeH, H$^{-}$, CO$_2$ and CH$_4$. Additional data of better accuracy from future observations of JWST should provide better constraint of the atmospheric properties of WASP-103b. |

|**Abstract**| Solar filament eruptions, flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are manifestations of drastic release of energy in the magnetic field, which are related to many eruptive phenomena from the Earth magnetosphere to black hole accretion disks. With the availability of high-resolution magnetograms on the solar surface, observational data-based modelling is a promising way to quantitatively study the underlying physical mechanisms behind observations. By incorporating thermal conduction and radiation losses in the energy equation, we develop a new data-driven radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, which has the capability to capture the thermodynamic evolution compared to our previous zero-\b{eta} model. Our numerical results reproduce major observational characteristics of the X1.0 flare on 2021 October 28 in NOAA active region (AR) 12887, including the morphology of the eruption, kinematic of flare ribbons, extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) radiations, and two components of the EUV waves predicted by the magnetic stretching model, i.e., a fast-mode shock wave and a slower apparent wave due to successive stretching of magnetic field lines. Moreover, some intriguing phenomena are revealed in the simulation. We find that flare ribbons separate initially and ultimately stop at the outer stationary quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs). Such outer QSLs correspond to the border of the filament channel and determine the final positions of flare ribbons, which can be used to predict the size and the lifetime of a flare before it occurs. In addition, the side view of the synthesized EUV and white-light images exhibit typical three-part structures of CMEs, where the bright leading front is roughly cospatial with the non-wave component of the EUV wave, reinforcing the magnetic stretching model for the slow component of EUV waves. |

|**Abstract**| The search for neutrino events in correlation with gravitational wave (GW) events for three observing runs (O1, O2 and O3) from 09/2015 to 03/2020 has been performed using the Borexino data-set of the same period. We have searched for signals of neutrino-electron scattering with visible energies above 250 keV within a time window of 1000 s centered at the detection moment of a particular GW event. Two types of incoming neutrino spectra were considered: the mono-energetic line and the spectrum expected from supernovae. The same spectra were considered for electron antineutrinos detected through inverse beta-decay (IBD) reaction. GW candidates originated by merging binaries of black holes (BHBH), neutron stars (NSNS) and neutron star and black hole (NSBH) were analysed separately. In total, follow-ups of 74 out of 93 gravitational waves reported in the GWTC-3 catalog were analyzed and no statistically significant excess over the background was observed. As a result, the strongest upper limits on GW-associated neutrino and antineutrino fluences for all flavors (\nu_e, \nu_\mu, \nu_\tau) have been obtained in the (0.5 - 5.0) MeV neutrino energy range. |
