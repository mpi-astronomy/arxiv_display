|**Abstract**|            The evolution of protoplanetary discs has a substantial impact on theories of planet formation. To date, neither of the two main competing evolutionary models, namely the viscous-photoevaporative paradigm and the MHD winds model, has been ruled out by observations. Due to the high number of sources observed by large surveys, population synthesis is a powerful tool to distinguish the evolution mechanism in observations. We explore the evolution of the mass distribution of synthetic populations under the assumptions of turbulence-driven accretion and dispersal caused by internal photoevaporation. We find that the rapid removal of light discs often results in an apparent increase of the median mass of the survived disc population. This occurs both when the disc properties are independent of each other, and when typical correlations between these quantities and the stellar mass are assumed. Furthermore, as MHD wind-driven accretion rarely manifests the same feature, this serves as a signature of the viscous-photoevaporative evolution when dispersal proceeds from inside-out. Therefore, we propose the evolution of the median mass as a new method to distinguish this model in observed populations. This survivorship bias is not shown by the median accretion rate, which, instead, decreases with time. Moreover, we introduce a new criterion that estimates the disc lifetime as a function of initial conditions and an analytical relation to predict whether internal photoevaporation triggers an inside-out or an outside-in dispersal. We verify both analytical relations with numerical simulations.         |

|**Abstract**|            Most young stars and therefore planetary systems form in high-mass star forming regions and are exposed to ultraviolet radiation, affecting the protoplanetary disk. These regions are located at large distances and only now with JWST become accessible to study the inner disks surrounding young stars. We present the eXtreme UV Environments (XUE) program, which provides the first detailed characterization of the physical and chemical properties of the inner disks around young intermediate-mass stars exposed to external irradiation from nearby massive stars. We present high signal to noise MIRI-MRS spectroscopy of 12 disks located in three sub-clusters of the high-mass star-forming region NGC 6357. Based on their mid-infrared spectral energy distribution, we classify the XUE sources into Group I and II based on the Meeus scheme. We analyze their molecular emission features, and compare their spectral indices and 10 $\mu$m silicate emission profiles to those of nearby Herbig and intermediate T Tauri disks. Despite being more massive, the XUE stars host disks with molecular richness comparable to isolated T Tauri systems. The 10 $\mu$m silicate features show lower F$_{11.3}$/F$_{9.8}$ ratios at a given F$_{\mathrm{peak}}$, but current uncertainties prevent conclusions about their inner disk properties. Most disks display water emission from the inner disk, suggesting that even in these extreme environments rocky planets can form in the presence of water. The absence of strong line fluxes and other irradiation signatures suggests that the XUE disks have been truncated by external UV photons. However, this truncation does not appear to significantly impact the chemical richness of their inner regions. These findings indicate that even in extreme environments, IMTT disks can retain the ingredients necessary for rocky planet formation.         |

|**Abstract**|            This manuscript investigates the possible existence of a binary supermassive black holes (BSMBH) system in the blue quasar SDSS J100438.8+151056 (=SDSS J1004+1510) at z=0.219 based on the detection of robust optical QPOs. We determine QPOs using multiple analysis methods applied to the CSS-V, ZTFg/r band light curves, and additionally, combined with the characteristics of broad emission lines and explores potential mechanisms for the QPOs, including jet and disk precession models. Two distinct periodicities, $1103\pm260$days and $243\pm29$days, are identified in the ZTF g/r-band light curves with confidence level exceeding $5\sigma$, through four different techniques. Meanwhile, the $1103\pm260$days periodicity is also clearly detected in the CSS V-band light curve. The optical periodicities suggest a BSMBH system candidate in SDSS J1004+1510, with an estimated total virial BH mass of $(1.13\pm0.14)\times10^8 M_{\odot}$ and a space separation of $0.0053\pm0.0016$pc for the periodicity of $1103\pm260$days. The second periodicity of $243\pm29$days could be attributed to harmonic oscillations, considering $(1103\pm260)/(243\pm29)\sim4.54\pm0.47$ with large scatters. However, if the periodicity of $243\pm29$days was from an independent QPO, a triple BH system candidate on sub-pc scale could be probably expected, with space separations of $0.00036\pm0.00004$pc between a close BSMBH system and of $0.0053\pm0.0016$pc between the BSMBH system and the third BH, after considering similar BH mass of the third BH as the total mass of the central BSMBH. These findings strongly demonstrate that combined light curves from the different sky survey projects can lead to more reliable QPOs candidates to be detected, and also indicate higher quality light curves could be helpful to find probably potential QPOs with multiple periodicities leading to rare detections of candidates for sub-pc triple BH systems.         |

|**Abstract**|            Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous, dispersed millisecond-duration radio bursts whose origin is poorly known. Recent observations suggest that some FRBs may reside in binary systems, even though conclusive evidence remains elusive. Here we report the detection of a 26.24$\pm$0.02 day periodicity in Faraday rotation measure (RM) of an actively repeating source named FRB 20201124A. The detection was made from 3,106 bursts collected with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) over ~365 days. The RM periodicity is coherently phase-connected across ~14 cycles over a 1-year duration. Our detection of RM periodicity corresponds to a natural logarithmic Bayesian factor of 1,168. The detection significances vary between 5.9-34 {\sigma} under different assumptions. Such a periodicity provides evidence for the binary nature of FRB 20201124A, where the periodic RM variations arise from the orbital motion of the FRB source within the magnetoionic environment of the system. Together with previous observations, our result suggests that being in binary systems may be a common feature for actively repeating FRB sources.         |

|**Abstract**|            As an X-ray and gamma-ray all-sky monitor aiming for high energy astrophysical transients, Gravitational-wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) has also made a series of observational discoveries on burst events of gamma-rays and particles in the low Earth orbit. Pitch angle is one of the key parameters of charged particles traveling around geomagnetic field. However, the usage of the GECAM-style instruments to measure the pitch angle of charged particles is still lacking. Here we propose a novel method for GECAM and similar instruments to measure the pitch angle of charged particles based on detector counts distribution. The basic conception of this method and simulation studies are described. With this method, the pitch angle of a peculiar electron precipitation event detected by GECAM-C is derived to be about 90$^\circ$, demonstrating the feasibility of our method. We note that the application of this method on GECAM-style instruments may open a new window for studying space particle events, such as Terrestrial Electron Beams (TEBs) and Lightning-induced Electron Precipitations (LEPs).         |

|**Abstract**|            Charged particle precipitation typically manifests as a gradual increase and decrease of flux observed by space detectors. Cases with rapidly flux variation are very rare. Periodic events are even more extraordinary. These oscillating particle precipitation (OPP) events are usually attributed to the bounce motion of electrons, which are induced by lightning. Owing to the observation limitations, there has been debate regarding whether these oscillations originate from temporal flux evolution or spatial structure evolution. Here we report three peculiar charged particle precipitation events detected by GECAM during a geomagnetic storm on March 21, 2024, with two exhibiting significant periodicity. These events were observed around the same region during three consecutive orbits. Through comprehensive temporal and spectral analyses, we revealed that one of the OPP events exhibited a transition in spectral lag of mini-pulses, shifting from "softer-earlier" to "softer-later" while showing no significant time evolution in overall frequency characteristics. And there is no association found between these two OPP events and lightning activity. Several possible scenarios are discussed to explain these charged particles with a life time of more than 3.5 hours, but the nature of these three events remains an enigma. We suggest that these GECAM-detected OPP events may represent a new type of particle precipitation event or a peculiar Lightning-induced Electron Precipitations (LEPs).         |
