|**Abstract**| We introduce the MUSE gAlaxy Groups in COSMOS (MAGIC) survey built to study the impact of environment on galaxy evolution over the last 8 Gyr. It consists of 17 MUSE fields targeting 14 massive structures at intermediate redshift ($0.3<z<0.8$) in the COSMOS area. We securely measure redshifts for 1419 sources and identify 76 galaxy pairs and 67 groups of at least 3 members using a friends-of-friends algorithm. The environment of galaxies is quantified from group properties, as well as from global and local density estimators, inferred from galaxy number density and dynamics within groups. The MAGIC survey increases the number of objects with a secure spectroscopic redshift over its footprint by a factor of $\sim 5$. Most of the new redshifts have apparent magnitudes in the $z^{++}$ band $z_{app}^{++}>21.5$. The spectroscopic redshift completeness is high: in the redshift range of [OII] emitters ($0.25 \le z < 1.5$), where most of the groups are found, it globally reaches a maximum of 80% down to $z_{app}^{++}=25.9$, and it locally decreases from $\sim 100$% to $\sim50$% in magnitude bins from $z_{app}^{++}=23-24$ to $z_{app}^{++}=25.5$. We find that the fraction of quiescent galaxies increases with local density and with the time spent in groups. A morphological dichotomy is also found between bulge-dominated quiescent and disk-dominated star-forming galaxies. As environment gets denser, the peak of the stellar mass distribution shifts towards $M_*>10^{10} M_\odot, the fraction of galaxies with $M_*<10^9 M_\odot$ decreasing significantly, even for star-forming galaxies. We also highlight peculiar features such as close groups, extended nebulae, and a gravitational arc. Our results suggest that galaxies are pre-processed in groups of increasing mass before entering rich groups and clusters. We publicly release two catalogs containing the properties of galaxies and groups, respectively. |

|**Abstract**| We develop the recipe to separate the spectral counterparts of the AGN NGC 1275 from the emission of the Perseus cluster surrounding it in the spectra observed by Suzaku/XIS cameras with no usage of the spectral fitting models. The Perseus cluster emission reaches higher energies than is typical for the most AGN-situated dense surroundings (i.e. up to 9-10 keV). That is why the separation between the AGN and cluster spectra is especially important in this case. To avoid the degeneracy due to the huge quantity of the spectral fitting parameters such as abundances of elements the cluster consists of, thermal and Compton emission of the nucleus itself, and the jet SSC/IC emission spectral parameters as well we prefer to avoid the spectral fitting usage to perform this task. Instead, we use the spatial resolution of the components and double background subtracting. For this purpose we choose the following regions to collect all the photons from them: (1) circular or square-shaped region around the source (AGN); (2) ring-shaped (or non-overlapped square) region surrounding the AGN (for cluster); (3) remote empty circular region for the background. Having collected the photons from those regions we subtract the background (i.e. photons from the third region) from the source and cluster spectra. Next, we subtract the re-normalized cluster counts from the AGN spectrum; using the relation between the emission line amplitudes in the AGN and cluster spectra as the renormalization coefficient. We have performed this procedure on the whole set of the Suzaku/XIS observational data for NGC 1275 to obtain the cleaned spectra and light curve of the AGN emission in this system. |

|**Abstract**| Polarisation is a powerful remote-sensing tool to study the nature of particles scattering the starlight. It is widely used to characterise interplanetary dust particles in the Solar System and increasingly employed to investigate extrasolar dust in debris discs' systems. We aim to measure the scattering properties of the dust from the debris ring around HD 181327 at near-infrared wavelengths. We obtained high-contrast polarimetric images of HD 181327 in the H band with the SPHERE / IRDIS instrument on the Very Large Telescope (ESO). We complemented them with archival data from HST / NICMOS in the F110W filter reprocessed in the context of the Archival Legacy Investigations of Circumstellar Environments (ALICE) project. We developed a combined forward-modelling framework to simultaneously retrieve the scattering phase function in polarisation and intensity. We detected the debris disc around HD 181327 in polarised light and total intensity. We measured the scattering phase function and the degree of linear polarisation of the dust at 1.6 micron in the birth ring. The maximum polarisation is 23.6% +/- 2.6% and occurs between a scattering angle of 70 deg and 82 deg. We show that compact spherical particles made of a highly refractive and relatively absorbing material in a differential power-law size distribution of exponent $-3.5$ can simultaneously reproduce the polarimetric and total intensity scattering properties of the dust. This type of material cannot be obtained with a mixture of silicates, amorphous carbon, water ice, and porosity, and requires a more refracting component such as iron-bearing minerals. We reveal a striking analogy between the near-infrared polarisation of comets and that of HD 181327. The methodology developed here combining VLT/SPHERE and HST/NICMOS may be applicable in the future to combine the polarimetric capabilities of SPHERE with the sensitivity of JWST. |

|**Abstract**| Variability is a prominent observational feature of blazars. The high-energy radiation mechanism of jets has always been important but still unclear. In this work, we performed a detailed analysis using Fermi-LAT data across 15 years and obtained GeV light curve information for 78 TeV blazars detected by Fermi. We provided annual GeV fluxes and corresponding spectral indices for the 78 TeV blazars and thorough monthly GeV fluxes for a subsample of 41 bright blazars. Our results suggest a strong correlation between the ${\gamma}$-ray photon index and $\log L_{\rm \gamma}$ for the flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and high-energy-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs). 14 sources in our sample show significant GeV outbursts/flares above the relatively stable, low-flux light curve, with 6 of them showing a clear sharp peak profile in their 5-day binned light curves. We quantified the variability utilizing the fractional variability parameter $F_{\mathrm{var}}$, and found that the flux of the FSRQs showed significantly stronger variability than that of the BL Lacs. The 41 bright blazars in this work are best fit by a log-normal flux distribution. We checked the spectral behavior and found 11 out of the 14 sources show a 'bluer-when-brighter (BWB)' trend, suggesting this spectral behavior for these TeV blazars at the GeV band arises from the mechanism that the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) process dominates the GeV emission. Our research offers a systematic analysis of the GeV variability properties of TeV blazars and serves as a helpful resource for further associated blazar studies. |

|| K. A. Alobaid, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |

|**Abstract**| Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are massive solar eruptions, which have a significant impact on Earth. In this paper, we propose a new method, called DeepCME, to estimate two properties of CMEs, namely, CME mass and kinetic energy. Being able to estimate these properties helps better understand CME dynamics. Our study is based on the CME catalog maintained at the Coordinated Data Analysis Workshops (CDAW) Data Center, which contains all CMEs manually identified since 1996 using the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). We use LASCO C2 data in the period between January 1996 and December 2020 to train, validate and test DeepCME through 10-fold cross validation. The DeepCME method is a fusion of three deep learning models, including ResNet, InceptionNet, and InceptionResNet. Our fusion model extracts features from LASCO C2 images, effectively combining the learning capabilities of the three component models to jointly estimate the mass and kinetic energy of CMEs. Experimental results show that the fusion model yields a mean relative error (MRE) of 0.013 (0.009, respectively) compared to the MRE of 0.019 (0.017, respectively) of the best component model InceptionResNet (InceptionNet, respectively) in estimating the CME mass (kinetic energy, respectively). To our knowledge, this is the first time that deep learning has been used for CME mass and kinetic energy estimations. |

|| S.-J. Chung, et al. -- incl., <mark>A. Gould</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-12-05*|

|**Abstract**| We report on the discovery and analysis of the planetary microlensing event OGLE-2019-BLG-1180 with a planet-to-star mass ratio $q \sim 0.003$. The event OGLE-2019-BLG-1180 has unambiguous cusp-passing and caustic-crossing anomalies, which were caused by a wide planetary caustic with $s \simeq 2$, where $s$ is the star-planet separation in units of the angular Einstein radius $\theta_{E}$. Thanks to well-covered anomalies by the Korea Micorolensing Telescope Network (KMTNet), we measure both the angular Einstein radius and the microlens parallax in spite of a relatively short event timescale of $t_{E} = 28$ days. However, because of a weak constraint on the parallax, we conduct a Bayesian analysis to estimate the physical lens parameters. We find that the lens system is a super-Jupiter-mass planet of $M_{p} = 1.75^{+0.54}_{-0.51} M_{J}$ orbiting a late-type star of $M_{h}=0.55^{+0.27}_{-0.26} M_\odot$ at a distance of $D_{L} = 6.1^{+0.9}_{-1.3}$ kpc. The projected star-planet separation is $a_{\perp} = 5.19^{+0.90}_{-1.23}$ au, which means that the planet orbits at about four times the snow line of the host star. Considering the relative lens-source proper motion of $\mu_{rel} = 6$ mas/yr, the lens will be separated from the source by 60 mas in 2029. At that time one can measure the lens flux from adaptive optics imaging of Kec or a next-generation 30 m class telescope. OGLE-2019-BLG-1180Lb represents a growing population of wide-orbit planets detected by KMTNet, so we also present a general investigation into prospects for further expanding the sample of such planets. |
