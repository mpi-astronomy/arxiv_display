|**Abstract**| Upcoming large-scale spectroscopic surveys with e.g. WEAVE and 4MOST will provide thousands of spectra of massive stars, which need to be analysed in an efficient and homogeneous way. Usually, studies of massive stars are limited to samples of a few hundred objects which pushes current spectroscopic analysis tools to their limits because visual inspection is necessary to verify the spectroscopic fit. Often uncertainties are only estimated rather than derived and prior information cannot be incorporated without a Bayesian approach. In addition, uncertainties of stellar atmospheres and radiative transfer codes are not considered as a result of simplified, inaccurate or incomplete/missing physics or, in short, idealised physical models. Here, we address the question of "How to compare an idealised model of complex objects to real data?" with an empirical Bayesian approach and maximum a {\it posterior} approximations. We focus on application to large scale optical spectroscopic studies of complex astrophysical objects like stars. More specifically, we test and verify our methodology on samples of OB stars in 30 Doradus region of the Large Magellanic Clouds using a grid of FASTWIND model atmospheres. Our spectroscopic model de-idealisation analysis pipeline takes advantage of the statistics that large samples provide by determining the model error to account for the idealised stellar atmosphere models, which are included into the error budget. The pipeline performs well over a wide parameter space and derives robust stellar parameters with representative uncertainties. |

|**Abstract**| We introduce a software suite developed for galaxy cluster cosmological analysis with the Dark Energy Survey Data. Cosmological analyses based on galaxy cluster number counts and weak-lensing measurements need efficient software infrastructure to explore an increasingly large parameter space, and account for various cosmological and astrophysical effects. Our software package is designed to model the cluster observables in a wide-field optical survey, including galaxy cluster counts, their averaged weak-lensing masses, or the cluster's averaged weak-lensing radial signals. To ensure maximum efficiency, this software package is developed in C++ in the CosmoSIS software framework, making use of the CUBA integration library. We also implement a testing and validation scheme to ensure the quality of the package. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this development by applying the software to the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 galaxy cluster cosmological data sets, and acquired cosmological constraints that are consistent with the fiducial Dark Energy Survey analysis. |

|**Abstract**| petitRADTRANS (pRT) is a fast radiative transfer code used for computing emission and transmission spectra of exoplanet atmospheres, combining a FORTRAN back end with a Python based user interface. It is widely used in the exoplanet community with 161 references in the literature to date, and has been benchmarked against numerous similar tools. The spectra calculated with pRT can be used as a forward model for fitting spectroscopic data using Monte Carlo techniques, commonly referred to as an atmospheric retrieval. The new retrieval module combines fast forward modelling with nested sampling codes, allowing for atmospheric retrievals on a large range of different types of exoplanet data. Thus it is now possible to use pRT to easily and quickly infer the atmospheric properties of exoplanets in both transmission and thermal emission. |
