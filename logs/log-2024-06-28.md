|**Abstract**|            A systematic, population-level discrepancy exists between the densities of exoplanets whose masses have been measured with transit timing variations (TTVs) versus those measured with radial velocities (RVs). Since the TTV planets are predominantly nearly resonant, it is still unclear whether the discrepancy is attributed to detection biases or to astrophysical differences between the nearly resonant and non resonant planet populations. We defined a controlled, unbiased sample of 36 sub-Neptunes characterised by Kepler, TESS, HARPS, and ESPRESSO. We found that their density depends mostly on the resonant state of the system, with a low probability (of $0.002_{-0.001}^{+0.010}$) that the mass of (nearly) resonant planets is drawn from the same underlying population as the bulk of sub-Neptunes. Increasing the sample to 133 sub-Neptunes reveals finer details: the densities of resonant planets are similar and lower than non-resonant planets, and both the mean and spread in density increase for planets that are away from resonance. This trend is also present in RV-characterised planets alone. In addition, TTVs and RVs have consistent density distributions for a given distance to resonance. We also show that systems closer to resonances tend to be more co-planar than their spread-out counterparts. These observational trends are also found in synthetic populations, where planets that survived in their original resonant configuration retain a lower density; whereas less compact systems have undergone post-disc giant collisions that increased the planet's density, while expanding their orbits. Our findings reinforce the claim that resonant systems are archetypes of planetary systems at their birth.         |

|**Abstract**|            Ionization drives important chemical and dynamical processes within protoplanetary disks, including the formation of organics and water in the cold midplane and the transportation of material via accretion and magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) flows. Understanding these ionization-driven processes is crucial for understanding disk evolution and planet formation. We use new and archival ALMA observations of HCO+, H13CO+, and N2H+ to produce the first forward-modeled 2D ionization constraints for the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. We include ionization from multiple sources and explore the disk chemistry under a range of ionizing conditions. Abundances from our 2D chemical models are post-processed using non-LTE radiative transfer, visibility sampling, and imaging, and are compared directly to the observed radial emission profiles. The observations are best fit by a modestly reduced CR ionization rate ($\zeta_{CR}$ ~ 10$^{-18}$ s$^{-1}$) and a hard X-ray spectrum (hardness ratio [HR] = 0.3), which we associate with stellar flaring conditions. Our best-fit model under-produces emission in the inner disk, suggesting that there may be an additional mechanism enhancing ionization in DM Tau's inner disk. Overall, our findings highlight the complexity of ionization in protoplanetary disks and the need for high resolution multi-line studies.         |

|**Abstract**|            Context. High frame-rate imaging was employed to mitigate the effects of atmospheric turbulence (seeing) in observations of globular cluster Terzan 5. Aims. High-precision time-series photometry has been obtained with the highest angular resolution so far taken in the crowded central region of Terzan 5, with ground-based telescopes, and ways to avoid saturation of the brightest stars in the field observed. Methods. The Electron-Multiplying Charge Coupled Device (EMCCD) camera installed at the Danish 1.54-m telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory was employed to produce thousands of short-exposure time images (ten images per second) that were stacked to produce the normal-exposure-time images (minutes). We employed difference image analysis in the stacked images to produce high-precision photometry using the DanDIA pipeline. Results. Light curves of 1670 stars with 242 epochs were analyzed in the crowded central region of Terzan 5 to statistically detect variable stars in the field observed. We present a possible visual counterpart outburst at the position of the pulsar J1748-2446N, and the visual counterpart light curve of the low-mass X-ray binary CX 3. Additionally, we present the discovery of 4 semiregular variables. We also present updated ephemerides and properties of the only RR Lyrae star previously known in the field covered by our observations in Terzan 5. Finally, we report a significant displacement of two sources by ~0.62 and 0.59 arcseconds with respect to their positions in previous images available in the literature.         |

|**Abstract**|            We use a new method to estimate the injected mass composition of ultrahigh cosmic rays (UHECRs) at energies higher than 10 EeV. The method is based on comparison of the energy-dependent distribution of cosmic ray arrival directions as measured by the Telescope Array experiment (TA) with that calculated in a given putative model of UHECR under the assumption that sources trace the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe. As we report in the companion letter, the TA data show large deflections with respect to the LSS which can be explained, assuming small extra-galactic magnetic fields (EGMF), by an intermediate composition changing to a heavy one (iron) in the highest energy bin. Here we show that these results are robust to uncertainties in UHECR injection spectra, the energy scale of the experiment and galactic magnetic fields (GMF). The assumption of weak EGMF, however, strongly affects this interpretation at all but the highest energies E > 100 EeV, where the remarkable isotropy of the data implies a heavy injected composition even in the case of strong EGMF. This result also holds if UHECR sources are as rare as $2 \times 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, that is the conservative lower limit for the source number density.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report an estimation of the injected mass composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) at energies higher than 10 EeV. The composition is inferred from an energy-dependent sky distribution of UHECR events observed by the Telescope Array surface detector by comparing it to the Large Scale Structure of the local Universe. In the case of negligible extra-galactic magnetic fields the results are consistent with a relatively heavy injected composition at E ~ 10 EeV that becomes lighter up to E ~ 100 EeV, while the composition at E > 100 EeV is very heavy. The latter is true even in the presence of highest experimentally allowed extra-galactic magnetic fields, while the composition at lower energies can be light if a strong EGMF is present. The effect of the uncertainty in the galactic magnetic field on these results is subdominant.         |
