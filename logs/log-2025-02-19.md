|**Abstract**|            Recent years have seen a surge of interest in the community studying the effect of ultraviolet radiation environment, predominantly set by OB stars, on protoplanetary disc evolution and planet formation. This is important because a significant fraction of planetary systems, potentially including our own, formed in close proximity to OB stars. This is a rapidly developing field, with a broad range of observations across many regions recently obtained or recently scheduled. In this paper, stimulated by a series of workshops on the topic, we take stock of the current and upcoming observations. We discuss how the community can build on this recent success with future observations to make progress in answering the big questions of the field, with the broad goal of disentangling how external photoevaporation contributes to shaping the observed (exo)planet population. Both existing and future instruments offer numerous opportunities to make progress towards this goal.         |

|**Abstract**|            Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from cosmic strings is crucial for unveiling the evolutionary laws of the early universe and validating non-standard cosmological models. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of the detection capabilities of next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detector networks for cosmic strings. By constructing a hybrid signal model incorporating multi-source astrophysical foreground noise, including compact binary coalescences (CBCs) and compact binary hyperbolic encounters (CBHEs), we propose an innovative parameter estimation methodology based on multi-component signal separation. Numerical simulations using one-year observational data reveal three key findings: (1) The CE4020ET network, comprising the Einstein Telescope (ET-10 km) and the Cosmic Explorer (CE-40 km and CE-20 km), achieves nearly one order of magnitude improvement in constraining the cosmic string tension $G\mu$ compared to individual detectors, reaching a relative uncertainty $\Delta G\mu / G\mu < 0.5$ for $G\mu > 3.5 \times 10^{-15}$ under standard cosmological framework; (2) The network demonstrates enhanced parameter resolution in non-standard cosmological scenarios, providing a novel approach to probe pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis cosmic evolution; (3) Enhanced detector sensitivity amplifies CBHE foreground interference in parameter estimation, while precise modeling of such signals could further refine $G\mu$ constraints by $1-2$ orders of magnitude. This research not only quantifies the detection potential of third-generation detector networks for cosmic string models but also elucidates the intrinsic connection between foreground modeling precision and cosmological parameter estimation accuracy, offering theoretical foundations for optimizing scientific objectives of next-generation gravitational wave observatories.         |

|**Abstract**|            High energy photons traveling through astrophysical magnetic fields have the potential to undergo oscillations with axion-like particles (ALPs), resulting in modifications to the observed photon spectrum. High energy $\gamma-$ray sources with significant magnetic field strengths provide an ideal setting to investigate this phenomenon. Ton 599, a flat spectrum radio quasar with a magnetic field strength on the order of Gauss in its emission region, presents a promising opportunity for studying ALP-photon oscillations. In this study, we analyze the effects of ALP-photon oscillations on the $\gamma$-ray spectrum of Ton 599 as observed by Fermi-LAT. Our investigation considers the potential influences of the broad-line region and dusty torus on the $\gamma-$ray spectrum of Ton 599. We set the constraints on the ALP parameters at the $95\%$ confidence level, and find that the constraints on \(g_{a\gamma}\) can reach approximately \(2 \times 10^{-12}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}\) for \(m_a \sim 10^{9}~\mathrm{eV}\).         |
