|**Abstract**| The disk-outflow connection plays a key role in extracting excess angular momentum from a forming protostar. We have previously reported the discovery of a small molecular outflow from the edge-on T Tauri star in the Bok globule CB26 that shows a peculiar velocity pattern, reminiscent of an outflow that corotates with the disk. We report new, high-resolution mm-interferometric observations of CB26 with the aim of revealing the morphology and kinematics of the outflow at the disk-outflow interface. The IRAM PdBI was used to observe CO(2-1) at 1.3mm with a resolution of 0.5". Using a physical model of the disk, which was derived from the dust emission, we employed chemo-dynamical modeling combined with line radiative transfer to constrain kinematic parameters and to construct a model of the CO emission from the disk that allowed us to separate the emission of the disk from that of the outflow. Our observations confirm the disk-wind nature of the rotating molecular outflow from CB26. The new high-resolution data reveal an X-shaped morphology of the CO emission close to the disk, and vertical streaks extending from the disk surface with a small half-opening angle of ~7deg, which can be traced out to vertical heights of ~500au. We interpret this emission as the combination of the disk atmosphere and a well-collimated disk wind, which we trace down to vertical heights of 40au, where it is launched from the surface of the flared disk at radii of 20-45au. The observed CO outflow has a total momentum flux of 1e-5 Msun km/s/yr, which is nearly three orders of magnitude larger than the maximum thrust that can be provided by the luminosity of the central star. We conclude that photoevaporation cannot be the main driving mechanism for this outflow, but it must be predominantly an MHD disk wind. It is thus far the best-resolved rotating disk wind observed to be launched from a circumstellar disk. |

|**Abstract**| Using the full six years of imaging data from the Dark Energy Survey, we study the surface brightness profiles of galaxy cluster central galaxies and intra-cluster light. We apply a ``stacking'' method to over four thousand galaxy clusters identified by the redMaPPer cluster finding algorithm in the redshift range of 0.2 to 0.5. This yields high signal-to-noise radial profile measurements of the central galaxy and intra-cluster light out to 1 Mpc from the cluster center. Using redMaPPer richness as a cluster mass indicator, we find that the intra-cluster light brightness has a strong mass dependence throughout the 0.2 to 0.5 redshift range, and the dependence grows stronger at a larger radius. In terms of redshift evolution, we find some evidence that the central galaxy, as well as the diffuse light within the transition region between the cluster central galaxy and intra-cluster light within 80 kpc from the center, may be growing over time. At larger radii, more than 80 kpc away from the cluster center, we do not find evidence of additional redshift evolution beyond the cluster mass dependence, which is consistent with the findings from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulation. We speculate that the major driver of intra-cluster light growth, especially at large radii, is associated with cluster mass growth. Finally, we find that the color of the cluster central galaxy and intra-cluster light displays a radial gradient that becomes bluer at a larger radius, which is consistent with a stellar stripping and disruption origin of intra-cluster light as suggested by simulation studies. |

|**Abstract**| Deploying \textit{multiple sharp transitions} (MSTs) under a unified framework, we investigate the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and the production of Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs) by incorporating one-loop corrected renormalized-resummed scalar power spectrum. With effective sound speed parameter, $1 \leq c_s \leq 1.17$, the direct consequence is the generation of PBH masses spanning $M_{\rm PBH}\sim{\cal O}(10^{-31}M_{\odot}- 10^{4}M_{\odot})$, thus evading well known \textit{No-go theorem} on PBH mass. Our results align coherently with the extensive NANOGrav 15-year data and the sensitivities outlined by other terrestrial and space-based experiments (e.g.: LISA, HLVK, BBO, HLV(O3), etc.). |

|**Abstract**| We present a comprehensive analysis of a Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) high-quality light curve for a young brown dwarf, MHO~4 having spectral type M7.0, in the Taurus star-forming region. We investigate the rotation periods and characterize the BD's dynamic atmosphere and surface features. We present light curve analysis of MHO~4, and estimate the rotation period to be around 2.224~d. Remarkably, MHO~4 exhibits two significant flaring events. Furthermore, we also estimated bolometric flare energies to be within the energy range of $10^{34}$ to $10^{35}$ erg, which sits in the superflare category. |

|| P. Palud, et al. -- incl., <mark>A. Hughes</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-09-06*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**| The interpretation of observations of atomic and molecular tracers in the galactic and extragalactic interstellar medium (ISM) requires comparisons with state-of-the-art astrophysical models to infer some physical conditions. Usually, ISM models are too time-consuming for such inference procedures, as they call for numerous model evaluations. As a result, they are often replaced by an interpolation of a grid of precomputed models. We propose a new general method to derive faster, lighter, and more accurate approximations of the model from a grid of precomputed models. These emulators are defined with artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed and trained to address the specificities inherent in ISM models. Indeed, such models often predict many observables (e.g., line intensities) from just a few input physical parameters and can yield outliers due to numerical instabilities or physical bistabilities. We propose applying five strategies to address these characteristics: 1) an outlier removal procedure; 2) a clustering method that yields homogeneous subsets of lines that are simpler to predict with different ANNs; 3) a dimension reduction technique that enables to adequately size the network architecture; 4) the physical inputs are augmented with a polynomial transform to ease the learning of nonlinearities; and 5) a dense architecture to ease the learning of simple relations. We compare the proposed ANNs with standard classes of interpolation methods to emulate the Meudon PDR code, a representative ISM numerical model. Combinations of the proposed strategies outperform all interpolation methods by a factor of 2 on the average error, reaching 4.5% on the Meudon PDR code. These networks are also 1000 times faster than accurate interpolation methods and require ten to forty times less memory. This work will enable efficient inferences on wide-field multiline observations of the ISM. |

|| C. Han, et al. -- incl., <mark>A. Gould</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-09-06*|
|*Comments*| *9 pages, 4 tables, 7 figures*|
|**Abstract**| We investigate the previous microlensing data collected by the KMTNet survey in search of anomalous events for which no precise interpretations of the anomalies have been suggested. From this investigation, we find that the anomaly in the lensing light curve of the event KMT-2021-BLG-1547 is approximately described by a binary-lens (2L1S) model with a lens possessing a giant planet, but the model leaves unexplained residuals. We investigate the origin of the residuals by testing more sophisticated models that include either an extra lens component (3L1S model) or an extra source star (2L2S model) to the 2L1S configuration of the lens system. From these analyses, we find that the residuals from the 2L1S model originate from the existence of a faint companion to the source. The 2L2S solution substantially reduces the residuals and improves the model fit by $\Delta\chi^2=67.1$ with respect to the 2L1S solution. The 3L1S solution also improves the fit, but its fit is worse than that of the 2L2S solution by $\Delta\chi^2=24.7$. According to the 2L2S solution, the lens of the event is a planetary system with planet and host masses $(M_{\rm p}/M_{\rm J}, M_{\rm h}/M_\odot)=\left( 1.47^{+0.64}_{-0.77}, 0.72^{+0.32}_{-0.38}\right)$ lying at a distance $\D_{\rm L} =5.07^{+0.98}_{-1.50}$~kpc, and the source is a binary composed of a subgiant primary of a late G or an early K spectral type and a main-sequence companion of a K spectral type. The event demonstrates the need of sophisticated modeling for unexplained anomalies for the construction of a complete microlensing planet sample. |
