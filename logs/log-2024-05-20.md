|**Abstract**|            Accretion bursts from low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) are known for many decades. In recent years, the first accretion bursts of massive YSOs (MYSOs) were observed. These phases of intense protostellar growth are of particular importance for studying massive star formation. Bursts of MYSOs are accompanied by flares of Class II methanol masers (hereafter masers), caused by an increase in exciting mid-infrared (MIR) emission. The G323.46$-$0.08 (hereafter G323) event extends the small sample of known MYSO bursts. Maser observations of the MYSO G323 show evidence of a flare, which was presumed to be caused by an accretion burst. This should be verified with IR data. We used time-dependent radiative transfer (TDRT) to characterize the heating and cooling timescales for eruptive MYSOs and to infer the main burst parameters. The G323 accretion burst is confirmed. It reached its peak in late 2013/early 2014 with a Ks-band increase of 2.5mag. TDRT indicates that the duration of the thermal afterglow in the far-infrared (FIR) can exceed the burst duration by years. The latter was proved by SOFIA observations, which indicate a flux increase of $(14.2\pm4.6)$% at $70\, \rm \mu m$ and $(8.5\pm6.1)$% at $160\, \mu$m in 2022 (2 years after the burst end). A one-sided light echo emerged that was propagating into the interstellar medium. The G323 burst is probably the most energetic MYSO burst observed so far. Within $8.4 \rm \, yrs$, an energy of $(0.9\pm_{0.8}^{2.5}) \times 10^{47}\,\rm erg$ was released. The short timescale points to the accretion of a compact body, while the burst energy corresponds to an accumulated mass of at least $(7\pm_{6}^{20})\,M_{Jup}$ and possibly even more if the protostar is bloated. In this case, the accretion event might have triggered protostellar pulsations, which give rise to the observed maser periodicity.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the short-period ($\sim$5.32 hours) and low-mass eclipsing binary TMTSJ0803 discovered by Tsinghua-Ma Huateng Telescope for Survey (TMTS). By fitting the light curves and radial velocity data with the Wilson--Devinney code, we find that the binary is composed of two late spotted active M dwarfs below the fully convective boundary. This is supported by the discovery of a significant Balmer emission lines in the LAMOST spectrum and prominent coronal X-ray emission. In comparison with the typical luminosity of rapidly rotating fully convective stars, the much brighter X-ray luminosity ($L_{X}/L_{\rm{bol}} = 0.0159 \pm 0.0059$) suggests the stellar magnetic activity of fully convective stars could be enhanced in such a close binary system. Given the metallicity of [M/H] = $-$ 0.35 dex as inferred from the LAMOST spectrum, we measure the masses and radii of both stars to be $M_{1} = 0.169 \pm 0.010~M_{\odot}$, $M_{2} = 0.162 \pm 0.016~M_{\odot}$, $R_{1} = 0.170 \pm 0.006~R_{\odot}$, and $R_{2} = 0.156 \pm 0.006~R_{\odot}$, respectively. Based on the luminosity ratio from the light curve modeling, the effective temperatures of two components are also estimated. In comparison with the stellar evolution models, the radii and effective temperatures of two components are all below the isochrones. The radius deflation might be mainly biased by a small radial velocity (RV) data or (and) a simple correction on RVs, while the discrepancy in effective temperature might be due to the enhanced magnetic activity in this binary.         |

|**Abstract**|            The exponential growth of astronomical datasets provides an unprecedented opportunity for humans to gain insight into the Universe. However, effectively analyzing this vast amount of data poses a significant challenge. Astronomers are turning to deep learning techniques to address this, but the methods are limited by their specific training sets, leading to considerable duplicate workloads too. Hence, as an example to present how to overcome the issue, we built a framework for general analysis of galaxy images, based on a large vision model (LVM) plus downstream tasks (DST), including galaxy morphological classification, image restoration, object detection, parameter extraction, and more. Considering the low signal-to-noise ratio of galaxy images and the imbalanced distribution of galaxy categories, we have incorporated a Human-in-the-loop (HITL) module into our large vision model, which leverages human knowledge to enhance the reliability and interpretability of processing galaxy images interactively. The proposed framework exhibits notable few-shot learning capabilities and versatile adaptability to all the abovementioned tasks on galaxy images in the DESI legacy imaging surveys. Expressly, for object detection, trained by 1000 data points, our DST upon the LVM achieves an accuracy of 96.7%, while ResNet50 plus Mask R-CNN gives an accuracy of 93.1%; for morphology classification, to obtain AUC ~0.9, LVM plus DST and HITL only requests 1/50 training sets compared to ResNet18. Expectedly, multimodal data can be integrated similarly, which opens up possibilities for conducting joint analyses with datasets spanning diverse domains in the era of multi-message astronomy.         |

|**Abstract**|            It has been proposed that the distinct formation and evolution of exoplanets and brown dwarfs may affect the chemical and isotopic content of their atmospheres. Recent work has indeed shown differences in the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotope ratio, provisionally attributed to the top-down formation of brown dwarfs and the core accretion pathway of super-Jupiters. The ESO SupJup Survey aims to disentangle the formation pathways of isolated brown dwarfs and planetary-mass companions using chemical and isotopic tracers. The survey uses high-resolution spectroscopy with the recently upgraded VLT/CRIRES$^+$ spectrograph, covering a total of 49 targets. Here, we present the first results: an atmospheric characterisation of DENIS J0255-4700, an isolated brown dwarf near the L-T transition. We analyse its K-band spectrum using a retrieval framework where the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS is coupled to PyMultiNest. Gaussian Processes are employed to model inter-pixel correlations and we adopt an updated parameterisation of the PT-profile. Abundances of CO, H$_2$O, CH$_4$, and NH$_3$ are retrieved for this fast-rotating L-dwarf. The ExoMol H$_2$O line list provides a significantly better fit than that of HITEMP. A free-chemistry retrieval is strongly favoured over equilibrium chemistry, caused by an under-abundance of CH$_4$. The free-chemistry retrieval constrains a super-solar C/O-ratio of $\sim0.68$ and a solar metallicity. We find tentative evidence ($\sim3\sigma$) for the presence of $^{13}$CO, with a constraint on the isotope ratio of $\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C}=184^{+61}_{-40}$ and a lower limit of $\gtrsim97$, suggesting a depletion of $^{13}$C compared to the interstellar medium ($\sim68$). High-resolution, high signal-to-noise K-band spectra provide an excellent means to constrain the chemistry and isotopic content of sub-stellar objects, as is the main objective of the ESO SupJup Survey.         |

|**Abstract**|            Empirical correlations connecting starlight to galaxy dynamics (e.g., the fundamental plane (FP) of elliptical/quiescent galaxies and the Tully--Fisher relation of spiral/star-forming galaxies) provide cosmology-independent distance estimation and are central to local Universe cosmology. In this work, we introduce the mass hyperplane (MH), which is the stellar-to-dynamical mass relation $(M_\star/M_\mathrm{dyn})$ recast as a linear distance indicator. Building on recent FP studies, we show that both star-forming and quiescent galaxies follow the same empirical MH, then use this to measure the peculiar velocities (PVs) for a sample of 2496 galaxies at $z<0.12$ from GAMA. The limiting precision of MH-derived distance/PV estimates is set by the intrinsic scatter in size, which we find to be $\approx$0.1~dex for both quiescent and star-forming galaxies (when modeled independently) and $\approx$0.11~dex when all galaxies are modeled together; showing that the MH is as good as the FP. To empirically validate our framework and distance/PV estimates, we compare the inferred distances to groups as derived using either quiescent or star-forming galaxies. A good agreement is obtained with no discernible bias or offset, having a scatter of $\approx$0.05~dex $\approx$12\% in distance. Further, we compare our PV measurements for the quiescent galaxies to the previous PV measurements of the galaxies in common between GAMA and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which shows similarly good agreement. Finally, we provide comparisons of PV measurements made with the FP and the MH, then discuss possible improvements in the context of upcoming surveys such as the 4MOST Hemisphere Survey (4HS).         |
