|**Abstract**|            The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) enables the characterisation of young self-luminous gas giants at previously inaccessible wavelengths, revealing physical processes in gas, dust, and clouds. We characterise the young planetary system TWA 27 (2M1207) in the mid-infrared (MIR), studying the atmosphere and disk spectra of the M9 brown dwarf TWA 27A and its L6 planetary-mass companion TWA 27b. We obtained data with the MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) from 4.9 to 20 um, and MIRI Imaging in the F1000W and F1500W filters. We applied high-contrast imaging methods to extract the companion's spectral energy distribution up to 15 um at 0.78 arcsec separation and a contrast of 60. Combining these with published JWST/NIRSpec spectra, we analysed the 1-20 um range using self-consistent atmospheric grids and 0D slab models for molecular disk emission. The atmosphere of TWA 27A is well fitted by a BT-SETTL model with Teff 2780 K, log g 4.3, plus a 740 K blackbody for the inner disk rim. The disk shows at least 11 organic molecules, with no water or silicate dust emission detected. The atmosphere of TWA 27b is matched by a Teff 1400 K low-gravity model with extinction, best fit by the ExoREM grid. MIRI spectra and photometry for TWA 27b reveal a silicate cloud absorption feature between 8-10 um and significant (>5 sigma) infrared excess at 15 um consistent with circumplanetary disk emission. These MIRI observations provide new insights into TWA 27, revealing diverse features to study the formation and evolution of circumplanetary disks and young dusty atmospheres.         |

|**Abstract**|            The L 98-59 system, identified by TESS in 2019, features three transiting exoplanets in compact orbits of 2.253, 3.691, and 7.451 days around an M3V star, with an outer 12.83-day non-transiting planet confirmed in 2021 using ESPRESSO. The planets exhibit a diverse range of sizes (0.8-1.6 R$_{\oplus}$), masses (0.5-3 M$_{\oplus}$), and likely compositions (Earth-like to possibly water-rich), prompting atmospheric characterization studies with HST and JWST. Here, we analyze 16 new TESS sectors and improve radial velocity (RV) precision of archival ESPRESSO and HARPS data using a line-by-line framework, enabling stellar activity detrending via a novel differential temperature indicator. We refine the radii of L 98-59 b, c, and d to 0.837 $\pm$ 0.019 R$_{\oplus}$, 1.329 $\pm$ 0.029 R$_{\oplus}$, 1.627 $\pm$ 0.041 R$_{\oplus}$, respectively. Combining RVs with transit timing variations (TTV) of L 98-59 c and d from TESS and JWST provides unprecedented constraints on the masses and eccentricities of the planets. We report updated masses of 0.46 $\pm$ 0.11 M$_{\oplus}$ for b, 2.00 $\pm$ 0.13 M$_{\oplus}$ for c, and 1.64 $\pm$ 0.07 M$_{\oplus}$ for d, and a minimum mass of 2.82 $\pm$ 0.19 M$_{\oplus}$ for e. We additionally confirm L 98-59\,f, a non-transiting super-Earth with a minimal mass of 2.80 $\pm$ 0.30 M$_{\oplus}$ on a 23.06-day orbit inside the Habitable Zone. The TTVs of L 98-59 c and d (<3 min, $P_{\rm TTV} = 396$ days) constrain the eccentricities of all planets to near-circular orbits ($e \lesssim 0.04$). An internal structure analysis of the transiting planets reveals increasing water-mass fractions ($f_{\rm H_{2}O}$) with orbital distance, reaching $f_{\rm H_{2}O} \approx 0.16$ for L 98-59\ d. We predict eccentricity-induced tidal heating in L 98-59 b with heat fluxes comparable to those of Io, potentially driving volcanic activity.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present new observations of the PDS 70 disc obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 9 (671 GHz) at 0.242$^{\prime\prime}$ resolution, which provide valuable insights into the spatial distribution of sub-millimetre grains in the disc. The data reveal a ring-like morphology, with a radial peak located between those previously observed at infrared wavelengths and longer millimetre observations. Additionally, we detect a tentative outer shoulder in Band 9 that is not observed at longer wavelengths. These findings suggest that small grains ($\sim 100 \mu$m) traced by Band 9 may be escaping from the pressure bump both radially inwards and outwards, or may be tracing different disc layers than those probed at longer wavelengths. A multi-wavelength analysis of the disc at millimetre wavelengths and the best fit to the spectral energy distribution shows the presence of centimetre grains around the ring location, where the dust surface density also peaks, compatible with dust trap models. The grain size in the disc cavity is not well constrained but is consistent with grains as small as 10 $\mu$m, supporting the hypothesis that small dust grain filters through the cavity. We use dust evolution models to demonstrate that a turbulent viscosity of $\alpha \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ allows small grains to filter through the disc gap, while $\alpha \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-3}$ is required to retain large grains in the pressure bump. The Band 9 observations of PDS 70 validate theoretical models and confirm the presence of pebble flux through the disc gap.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the main-sequence binary (MSMS) Catalog derived from Gaia Data Release 3 BP/RP (XP) spectra. Leveraging the vast sample of low-resolution Gaia XP spectra, we develop a forward modeling approach that maps stellar mass and photometric metallicity to XP spectra using a neural network. Our methodology identifies binary systems through statistical comparison of single- and binary-star model fits, enabling detection of binaries with mass ratios between 0.4 and 1.0 and flux ratios larger than 0.1. From an initial sample of 35 million stars within 1 kpc, we identify 14 million binary candidates and define a high-confidence "golden sample" of 1 million binary systems. This large, homogeneous sample enables detailed statistical analysis of binary properties across diverse Galactic environments, providing new insights into binary star formation and evolution. In addition, the $\chi^2$ comparison allows us to distinguish stars with luminous companions from single stars or binaries with dark companions, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars and black hole candidates, improving our understanding of compact object populations.         |

|**Abstract**|            As cosmological simulations and their associated software become increasingly complex, physicists face the challenge of searching through vast amounts of literature and user manuals to extract simulation parameters from dense academic papers, each using different models and formats. Translating these parameters into executable scripts remains a time-consuming and error-prone process. To improve efficiency in physics research and accelerate the cosmological simulation process, we introduce SimAgents, a multi-agent system designed to automate both parameter configuration from the literature and preliminary analysis for cosmology research. SimAgents is powered by specialized LLM agents capable of physics reasoning, simulation software validation, and tool execution. These agents collaborate through structured communication, ensuring that extracted parameters are physically meaningful, internally consistent, and software-compliant. We also construct a cosmological parameter extraction evaluation dataset by collecting over 40 simulations in published papers from Arxiv and leading journals that cover diverse simulation types. Experiments on the dataset demonstrate a strong performance of SimAgents, highlighting its effectiveness and potential to accelerate scientific research for physicists. Our demonstration video is available at: this https URL. The complete system and dataset are publicly available at this https URL.         |

|| E. S. Yorgancioglu, D. M. Saeed, R. Moradi, <mark>Y. Wang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-15*|

|**Abstract**|            The Dainotti relation empirically connects the isotropic plateau luminosity ($L_X$) in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) X-ray afterglows to the rest-frame time at which the plateau ends ($T_a^*$), enabling both the standardization of GRBs and their use as cosmological probes. However, the precise physical mechanisms underlying this correlation remain an active area of research. Although magnetars, highly magnetized neutron stars, have been proposed as central engines powering GRB afterglows, traditional dipole spin-down radiation models fail to account for the full diversity of observed behaviors. This limitation necessitates a more comprehensive framework. We propose that multipolar magnetic field emissions from magnetars offer a plausible explanation for the Dainotti relation. Unlike simple dipole fields, higher-order multipolar configurations enable more complex energy dissipation processes. The coexistence of multiple components can plausibly explain the range of afterglow decay indices found from a sample of 238 GRBs with plateau features from the Swift-XRT database up to the end of December 2024, the majority of which deviate from the dipolar prediction of $\alpha = -2$, and more crucially, the spin-down physics yields a link between $L_X$ and $T_a^*$ in a way that preserves the Dainotti correlation with a slope of $b = - 1$, independent of the specific multipole order. Moreover, we find that the inclusion of higher order multipoles can explain the range of plateau energies found in the Dainotti relations. Thus, a unified picture emerges in which multipolar fields are able to reproduce both the slope and the normalization of the correlation.         |

|| Q. Li, et al. -- incl., <mark>H. Jiang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-15*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            We introduce MVPinn, a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach tailored for solving the Milne-Eddington (ME) inversion problem, specifically applied to spectropolarimetric observations from the Big Bear Solar Observatory's Near-InfraRed Imaging Spectropolarimeter (BBSO/NIRIS) at the Fe I 1.56 {\mu}m lines. Traditional ME inversion methods, though widely used, are computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, and often struggle to accurately capture complex profile asymmetries resulting from gradients in magnetic field strength, orientation, and line-of-sight velocities. By embedding the ME radiative transfer equations directly into the neural network training as physics-informed constraints, our MVPinn method robustly and efficiently retrieves magnetic field parameters, significantly outperforming traditional inversion methods in accuracy, noise resilience, and the ability to handle asymmetric and weak polarization signals. After training, MVPinn infers one magnetogram in about 15 seconds, compared to tens of minutes required by traditional ME inversion on high-resolution spectropolarimetric data. Quantitative comparisons demonstrate excellent agreement with well-established magnetic field measurements from the SDO/HMI and Hinode/SOT-SP instruments, with correlation coefficients of approximately 90%. In particular, MVPINN aligns better with Hinode/SOT-SP data, indicating some saturation of HMI data at high magnetic strengths. We further analyze the physical significance of profile asymmetries and the limitations inherent in the ME model assumption. Our results illustrate the potential of physics-informed machine learning methods in high-spatial-temporal solar observations, preparing for more sophisticated, real-time magnetic field analysis essential for current and next-generation solar telescopes and space weather monitoring.         |

|**Abstract**|            Gravitational wave astronomy presents a promising opportunity to directly observe scalar-induced gravitational waves originating from the early universe. Future experiments, including ground-based interferometers like LIGO and Virgo, the Pulsar Timing Array, and telescopes such as FAST and SKA, are poised to significantly enhance sensitivity to these gravitational waves. In this paper, we combined Cosmic Microwave Background data with upper or lower limits of the stochastic gravitational wave background provided by FAST or SKA, to constrain scalar-induced gravitational waves. To provide a comprehensive forecast, we consider two scenarios: one where FAST or SKA does not detect scalar-induced gravitational waves, thereby setting an upper limit on the fractional energy density; and another where these waves are detected successfully, thus establishing a lower limit on the fractional energy density. In the $\Lambda$CDM+$r$ model, the scalar spectral index of the power-law power spectrum is constrained to $n_s=0.9589^{+0.0021}_{-0.0011}$ from the combinations of CMB+BAO+SKA datasets in the upper limit scenario. The constraint shifts to $n_s = 0.9661^{+0.0027}_{-0.0039}$ in the lower limit scenario. Comparing with the constraint from the combinations of CMB+BAO datasets, the scalar spectral index $n_s$ exhibits significant changes, which could serve as an indicator for detecting scalar-induced gravitational waves. In the $\Lambda$CDM+$\alpha_s$+$r$ model and the $\Lambda$CDM+$\alpha_s$+$\beta_s$+$r$ model, the running of the scalar spectral index $\alpha_s$ and the running of the running of the scalar spectral index $\beta_s$ also show notable variations, suggesting potential indicators. The numerical findings clearly demonstrate the impact of the upper and lower limits provided by FAST or SKA.         |

|**Abstract**|            Massive protoclusters at z~1.5-4, the peak of the cosmic star formation history, are key to understanding the formation mechanisms of massive galaxies in today's clusters. However, studies of protoclusters at these high redshifts remain limited, primarily due to small sample sizes and heterogeneous selection criteria. In this work, we conduct a systematic investigation of the star formation and cold gas properties of member galaxies of eight massive protoclusters in the COSMOS field, using the statistical and homogeneously selected sample from the Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE). Our analysis reveals a steep increase in the star formation rates per halo mass ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR} /M_{\rm halo}$) with redshifts in these intensively star-forming protoclusters, reaching values one to two orders of magnitude higher than those observed in the field at z>2. We further show that, instead of an enhancement of starbursts, this increase is largely driven by the concentration of massive and gas-rich star-forming galaxies in the protocluster cores. The member galaxies still generally follow the same star formation main sequence as in the field, with a moderate enhancement at the low mass end. Notably, the most massive protocluster galaxies ($M_{\rm halo}$>8$\times$10$^{10}$M$_\odot$) exhibit higher $f_{\rm gas}$ and $\tau_{\rm gas}$ than their field counterparts, while remaining on the star forming main sequence. These gas-rich, massive, and star-forming galaxies are predominantly concentrated in the protocluster cores and are likely progenitors of massive ellipticals in the center of today's clusters. These results suggest that the formation of massive galaxies in such environments is sustained by substantial gas reservoirs, which support persistent star formation and drive early mass assembly in forming cluster cores.         |

|| <mark>N. Mackensen</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-15*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in A&A*|
|**Abstract**|            PG 1159 stars are thought to be progenitors of the majority of H-deficient white dwarfs. Their unusual He-, C-, and O-dominated surface composition is typically believed to result from a late thermal pulse experienced by a single (pre-)white dwarf. Yet, other formation channels - involving close binary evolution - have recently been proposed and could lead to similar surface compositions. Here we present a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral analysis based on new UV and archival optical spectra of one of the hottest PG 1159 stars, $\text{RX J}0122.9\text{ -}7521$. We find $T_\text{eff} = 175$ kK and a surface gravity of log $g = 7.7$, and an astonishingly low O/C ratio of $7.3 \times 10^{-3}$ by mass. By combining the spectroscopic surface gravity and Gaia parallax with a spectral energy distribution fit, we derive a mass of $M_\text{spec} = 1.8^{+1.1}_{-0.7}$ $M_\odot$. Although this spectroscopic mass is higher than predicted by evolutionary models, it is subject to substantial uncertainty. Furthermore, we find that $\text{RX J}0122.9\text{ -}7521$ shows strongly rotationally broadened lines, suggesting that the previously reported photometric period of $41$ min indeed corresponds to the rotational period of this star. Our kinematic analysis shows that $\text{RX J}0122.9\text{ -}7521$ belongs to the Galactic halo, which - assuming single-star evolution - is in stark contrast to its relatively high mass. The rapid rotation, high mass, and halo kinematics, as well as the lack of evidence for a close companion, lead us to believe that $\text{RX J}0122.9\text{ -}7521$ formed through the merger of two white dwarfs. Yet, none of the current models can explain the surface abundances of $\text{RX J}0122.9\text{ -}7521$.         |

|**Abstract**|            The dust-to-gas ratio in the protoplanetary disk, which is likely imprinted into the host star metallicity, is a property that plays a crucial role during planet formation. We aim at constraining planet formation and evolution processes by statistically analysing planetary systems generated by the Generation III Bern model, comparing with the correlations derived from observational samples. Using synthetic planets biased to observational completeness, we find that (1) the occurrence rates of large giant planets and Neptune-size planets are positively correlated with [Fe/H], while small sub-Earths exhibit an anti-correlation. In between, for sub-Neptune and super-Earth, the occurrence rate first increases and then decreases with increasing [Fe/H] with an inflection point at 0.1 dex. (2) Planets with orbital periods shorter than ten days are more likely to be found around stars with higher metallicity, and this tendency weakens with increasing planet radius. (3) Both giant planets and small planets exhibit a positive correlation between the eccentricity and [Fe/H], which could be explained by the self-excitation and perturbation of outer giant planets. (4) The radius valley deepens and becomes more prominent with increasing [Fe/H], accompanied by a lower super-Earth-to-sub-Neptune ratio. Furthermore, the average radius of the planets above the valley increases with [Fe/H]. Our nominal model successfully reproduces many observed correlations with stellar metallicity, supporting the description of physical processes and parameters included in the Bern model. However, the dependences of orbital eccentricity and period on [Fe/H] predicted by the synthetic population is however significantly weaker than observed. This discrepancy suggests that long-term dynamical interactions between planets, along with the impact of binaries/companions, can drive the system towards a dynamically hotter state.         |
