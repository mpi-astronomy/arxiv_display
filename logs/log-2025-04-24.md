|**Abstract**|            In this paper, we present a homogeneous analysis of close-in Neptune planets. To do this, we compile a sample of TESS-observed planets using a ranking criterion which takes into account the planet's period, radius, and the visual magnitude of its host star. We use archival and new HARPS data to ensure every target in this sample has precise radial velocities. This yields a total of 64 targets, 46 of which are confirmed planets and 18 of which show no significant radial velocity signal. We explore the mass-radius distribution, planetary density, stellar host metallicity, and stellar and planetary companions of our targets. We find 26$\%$ of our sample are in multi-planet systems, which are typically seen for planets located near the lower edge of the Neptunian desert. We define a 'gold' subset of our sample consisting of 33 confirmed planets with planetary radii between 2$R_{\oplus}$ and 10$R_{\oplus}$. With these targets, we calculate envelope mass fractions (EMF) using the GAS gianT modeL for Interiors (GASTLI). We find a clear split in EMF between planets with equilibrium temperatures below and above 1300~K, equivalent to an orbital period of $\sim$3.5~days. Below this period, EMFs are consistent with zero, while above they typically range from 20$\%$ to 40$\%$, scaling linearly with the planetary mass. The orbital period separating these two populations coincides with the transition between the Neptunian desert and the recently identified Neptunian ridge, further suggesting that different formation and/or evolution mechanisms are at play for Neptune planets across different close-in orbital regions.         |

|**Abstract**|            Ultralight (or fuzzy) dark matter (ULDM) is an alternative to cold dark matter. A key feature of ULDM is the presence of solitonic cores at the centers of collapsed halos. These would potentially increase the drag experienced by supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, changing their merger dynamics and the resulting gravitational wave background. We perform detailed simulations of high-mass SMBH binaries in the soliton of a massive halo. We find more rapid decay than previous simulations and semi-analytic approximations. We confirm expectations that the drag depends strongly on the ULDM particle mass, finding masses greater than $10^{-21}$ eV could potentially alleviate the final parsec problem and that ULDM may even suppress gravitational wave production at lower frequencies in the pulsar timing band.         |

|**Abstract**|            Using 15 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we performed a comprehensive analysis on the gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057. Its spectrum in 0.1-300 GeV band is well described by a power law model with an index of $2.40\pm0.16$, leading to an energy flux of (5.5$\pm$1.6$)\times$ 10$^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The GeV Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of HESS J0632+057 hints for a spectral turn-over between $\sim$10-100 GeV. Orbital analysis reveals a flux enhancement during the phase range of 0.2-0.4, consistent with the X-ray and TeV light curves, indicating an origin of a common particle population. We carried out six deep radio observations on HESS J0632+057 with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), evenly distributed across its orbit, reaching a detection sensitivity of 2$\mu$Jy. However, no radio pulsation was detected within these observations. The absence of radio pulsation may be attributed to the dense stellar wind environment of HESS J0632+057.         |

|**Abstract**|            Radio astronomy is part of radio science that developed rapidly in recent decades. In the research of radio astronomy, pulsars have always been an enduring popular research target. To find and observe more pulsars, large radio telescopes have been built all over the world. In this paper, we present our studies on pulsars in M15 and NGC 6517 with FAST, including monitoring pulsars in M15 and new pulsar discoveries in NGC 6517. All the previously known pulsars in M15 were detected without no new discoveries. Among them, M15C was still detectable by FAST, while it is assumed to fade out due to precession [1]. In NGC 6517, new pulsars were continues to be discovered and all of them are tend to be isolated pulsars. Currently, the number of pulsars in NGC 6517 is 17, much more than the predicted before [2].         |
