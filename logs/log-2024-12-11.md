|**Abstract**|            We present a stringent measurement of the dust-obscured star-formation rate density (SFRD) at $z=4-6$ from the ASPIRE JWST Cycle-1 medium and ALMA Cycle-9 large program. We obtained JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy and ALMA 1.2-mm continuum map along 25 independent quasar sightlines, covering a total survey area of $\sim$35 arcmin$^2$ where we search for dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at $z = 0 - 7$. We identify eight DSFGs in seven fields at $z=4-6$ through the detection of H$\alpha$ or [O III] $\lambda$5008 lines, including fainter lines such as H$\beta$, [O III] $\lambda$4960, [N II] $\lambda$6585, [S II] $\lambda\lambda$6718,6733 for six sources. With this spectroscopically complete DSFG sample at $z=4-6$ and negligible impact from cosmic variance (shot noise), we measure the infrared luminosity function (IRLF) down to $L_\mathrm{IR} \sim 2\times10^{11}$ $L_\odot$. We find flattening of IRLF at $z=4-6$ towards the faint end (power-law slope $\alpha = 0.59_{-0.45}^{+0.39}$). We determine the dust-obscured cosmic SFRD at this epoch as $\log[\rho_\mathrm{SFR,IR} / (\mathrm{M}_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3})] = -1.52_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$. This is significantly higher than previous determination using ALMA data in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, which is void of DSFGs at $z=4-6$ because of strong cosmic variance (shot noise). We conclude that the majority ($66\pm7$%) of cosmic star formation at $z \sim 5$ is still obscured by dust. We also discuss the uncertainty of SFRD propagated from far-IR spectral energy distribution and IRLF at the bright end, which will need to be resolved with future ALMA and JWST observations.         |

|**Abstract**|            Diffraction-limited radial velocity instruments offer a pathway towards improved precision and stability, and the exploration of new parameter spaces at high spatial and spectral resolution. However, achieving the necessary performance requires careful instrument design and considerable on-sky testing. We describe the design and construction of ``Little iLocater'' (Lili), a compact spectrograph that has been used to validate the performance of the front-end fibre-injection system of the iLocater spectrograph. We present the design, assembly, and performance using on-sky data obtained at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT), including extraction of spectra from standard stars, testing of the atmospheric dispersion corrector to elevations of 40 degrees, and spatially resolved spectra from close companion systems. These results show the front-end fibre-injection system is performing as expected and is indicative of iLocater's capabilities once installed at the LBT.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present $0."026$ $(140\ \rm{pc})$ resolution ALMA observations of [C II] $158\ \mu\rm{m}$ and dust continuum emission of the $z=6.6$ quasar J0305--3150, resolved over $\sim 300-400$ independent resolution elements. The dust continuum emission is compact with $\sim 80\%$ recovered within $r<0."3$ $(1.6\ \rm{kpc})$, whereas the [C II] emission profile is composed of a central Gaussian ($r<0."4$, i.e. $<2.2\ \rm{kpc}$) and an extended component (detected up to $\sim 10\ \rm{kpc}$ at $>3\sigma$). We infer a direct contribution of the quasar to the observed 260\ \rm{GHz} continuum $S_{\nu,\rm{QSO}} / S_{\nu,\rm{QSO+Host}} \lesssim 1\%$. We report the detection of FIR-detected star-forming clumps with $r<200 \ \rm{pc}$ and properties similar to that of rest-frame UV-optical clumps reported in the literature. The $200\ \rm{pc}$ resolved [C II]/FIR ratio follows the global relation with the FIR surface brightness established in low- and high-redshift galaxies, even at the quasar location. We find that dust continuum is emitted in regions of $\sim0."02-0."04$ consistent with the size of photo-dissociation regions (PDR), whereas $50\%$ of the [C II] originates from larger physical scales ($\theta \gtrsim 2"$). The large-scale [C II] emission presents a velocity gradient aligned with a nearby companion with perturbed kinematics, and misaligned with the kinematics of the small-scale emission. The absence of significant [C II] emission by structures with physical scale $\lesssim 1\ \rm{kpc}$ implies that [C II] emission is not produced in dense PDR located at the boundary of Giant Molecular Clouds. We argue instead that [C II] is produced in low-density PDRs in the interstellar medium and diffuse HI gas tidally-stripped during the ongoing merger.         |

|**Abstract**|            Radial velocity (RV) jitter represents an intrinsic limitation on the precision of Doppler searches for exoplanets that can originate from both instrumental and astrophysical sources. We aim to determine the RV jitter floor in M dwarfs and investigate the stellar properties that lead to RV jitter induced by stellar activity. We determined the RV jitter in 239 M dwarfs from the CARMENES survey that are predominantly of mid to late spectral type and solar metallicity. We also investigated the correlation between stellar rotation and magnetic fields with RV jitter. The median jitter in the CARMENES sample is 3.1 m/s, and it is 2.3 m/s for stars with an upper limit of 2 km/s on their projected rotation velocities. We provide a relation between the stellar equatorial rotation velocity and RV jitter in M dwarfs based on a subsample of 129 well-characterized CARMENES stars. RV jitter induced by stellar rotation dominates for stars with equatorial rotation velocities greater than 1 km/s. A jitter floor of 2 m/s dominates in stars with equatorial rotation velocities below 1 km/s. This jitter floor likely contains contributions from stellar jitter, instrumental jitter, and undetected companions. We study the impact of the average magnetic field and the distributions of magnetic filling factors on the RV jitter. We find a series of stars with excess RV jitter and distinctive distributions of magnetic filling factors. These stars are characterized by a dominant magnetic field component between 2-4 kG. An RV jitter floor can be distinguished from RV jitter induced by activity and rotation based on the stellar equatorial rotation velocity. RV jitter induced by activity and rotation primarily depends on the equatorial rotation velocity. This RV jitter is also related to the distribution of magnetic filling factors, and this emphasizes the role of the magnetic field in the generation of RV jitter.         |

|**Abstract**|            The advent of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors opens new opportunities for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star merger events, holding significant potential for probing the history of cosmic expansion. In this paper, we investigate the holographic dark energy (HDE) model by using the future GW standard siren data observed from the 3G GW detectors and the short $\gamma$-ray burst THESEUS-like detector joint observations. We find that GW data alone can achieve a relatively precise estimation of the Hubble constant, with precision of $0.2\%$-$0.6\%$, but its ability to constrain other cosmological parameters remains limited. Nonetheless, since the GW data can break parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB + BAO + SN (CBS), GW standard sirens play a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy of parameter estimation. With the addition of GW data to CBS, the constraints on cosmological parameters $H_0$, $c$ and $\Omega_{\rm{m}}$ can be improved by $63\%$-$88\%$, $27\%$-$44\%$ and $55\%$-$70\%$. In summary, observations of GW standard sirens from 3G GW detectors could be pivotal in helping solve the Hubble tension and probe the fundamental nature of dark energy.         |

|| <mark>M. Sharma</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-12-11*|
|*Comments*| *15 pages and 10 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A*|
|**Abstract**|            Context: The study of quasar outflows is essential in understanding the connection between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies. We analyze the VLT/UVES spectrum of quasar SDSS J0932+0840 and identify several narrow and broad outflow components in absorption, with multiple ionization species including Fe II, which puts it among a rare class of outflows known as FeLoBALs. Aims: We study one of the outflow components to determine its physical characteristics by determining the total hydrogen column density, ionization parameter and the hydrogen number density. Through these parameters, we aim to obtain the distance of the outflow from the central source, its mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity, and to constrain the contribution of the outflow to AGN feedback. Methods: We obtain the ionic column densities from the absorption troughs in the spectrum, and use photoionization modeling to extract the physical parameters of the outflow, including the total hydrogen column density and ionization parameter. The relative population of the observed excited states of Fe II is used to model the hydrogen number density of the outflow. Results: We use the Fe II excited states to model the electron number density ($n_e$) and hydrogen number density ($n_H$) independently and obtain $n_e$ $\simeq$ $10^{3.4}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $n_H$ $\simeq$ $10^{4.8}$ cm$^{-3}$. Our analysis of the physical structure of the cloud shows that these two results are consistent with each other. This places the outflow system at a distance of $0.7_{-0.4}^{+0.9}$ kpc from the central source, with mass flow rate ($\dot{M}$) of $43^{+65}_{-26}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and kinetic luminosity ($\dot{E_k}$) of $0.7^{+1.1}_{-0.4}$ $\times$ $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$.         |

|**Abstract**|            We study the rest-frame optical and ultraviolet morphology of galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe. Using JWST data from the UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys targeting the lensing cluster Abell 2744 we present multi-band morphological measurements for a sample of 995 galaxies selected using 20-band NIRCam photometry and 35 using NIRSpec Prism spectroscopy over the redshift range of $4<z<8$. The wavelength-dependent morphology is measured using pysersic by simultaneously modeling the images in 6 NIRCam wide filters covering the rest-frame UV to optical. The joint modeling technique increases the precision of measured radii by 50\%. Galaxies in our sample show a wide range of Sersic indices, with no systematic difference between optical and UV morphology. We model the size-mass relation in a Bayesian manner using a continuity model to directly fit the redshift evolution while accounting for observational uncertainties. We find the average size of galaxies at $\log M_*/M_\odot=8.5$ grows rapidly, from 400 pc at $z=8$ to 830 pc at $z=4$. This is faster evolution than expected from power law scalings of the Hubble parameter or scale factor that describe well previous results at $z<2$. This suggests that different and/or much stronger processes affect low mass systems during the epoch of reionization. The measured logarithmic slope (0.25) and scatter (0.23 dex) are non-evolving. We discuss the remarkable consistency of the slope and scatter over cosmic time in the context of the galaxy-halo connection.         |
