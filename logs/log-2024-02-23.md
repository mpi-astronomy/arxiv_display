|**Abstract**| Transport-induced quenching in hot Jupiter atmospheres is a process that determines the boundary between the part of the atmosphere at chemical equilibrium and the part of the atmosphere at thermochemical (but not photothermochemical) disequilibrium. The location of this boundary, the quench level, depends on the interplay between the dynamical and chemical timescales in the atmosphere, with quenching occurring when these timescales are equal. We explore the sensitivity of the quench level position to an increase in the planet's atmospheric metallicity using aerosol-free 3D GCM simulations of a hot Jupiter WASP-96b. We find that the temperature increase at pressures of $\sim$$10^{4}-10^{7}$ Pa that occurs when metallicity is increased could shift the position of the quench level to pressures dominated by the jet, and cause an equatorial depletion of $CH_4$, $NH_3$ and $HCN$. We discuss how such a depletion affects the planet's transmission spectrum, and how the analysis of the evening-morning limb asymmetries, especially within $\sim3-5 {\mu}m$, could help distinguish atmospheres of different metallicities that are at chemical equilibrium from those with the upper layers at thermochemical disequilibrium. |

|**Abstract**| We are performing a line survey of 8 planet-forming Class II disks in Taurus with the IRAM NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA), as a part of the MPG-IRAM Observatory Program PRODIGE (PROtostars and DIsks: Global Evolution; PIs: P. Caselli and Th. Henning). Compact and extended disks around T Tauri stars CI, CY, DG, DL, DM, DN, IQ Tau, and UZ Tau E are observed in ~80 lines from >20 C-, O,- N-, and S-bearing species. The observations in four spectral settings at 210-280 GHz with $1\sigma$ rms sensitivity of ~8-12 mJy/beam at 0.9" and 0.3 km/s resolution will be completed in 2024. The uv-visibilities are fitted with the DiskFit model to obtain key stellar and disk properties. In this paper, the combined $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O $J = 2-1$ data are presented. We find that the CO fluxes and disk masses inferred from dust continuum tentatively correlate with the CO emission sizes. We constrain dynamical stellar masses, geometries, temperatures, the CO column densities and gas masses for each disk. The best-fit temperatures at 100 au are ~17-37 K, and decrease radially with the power-law exponent q ~ 0.05-0.76. The inferred CO column densities decrease radially with the power-law exponent p ~ 0.2-3.1. The gas masses estimated from $^{13}$CO (2-1) are ~ $0.001-0.2 M_\textrm{Sun}$. The best-fit CO column densities point to severe CO freeze-out in the disks. The DL Tau disk is an outlier, and has either stronger CO depletion or lower gas mass than the rest of the sample. The CO isotopologue ratios are roughly consistent with the observed values in disks and the low-mass star-forming regions. |

|**Abstract**| We selected sources with a steep soft-X-ray-band spectrum with a photon index larger than 2.5 -- measured by eROSITA on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) -- from the eFEDS AGN catalogue as candidates of highly accreting supermassive black holes, and investigated their multi-wavelength properties. Among 601 bright AGN with 0.2-5 keV counts of greater than 100, 83 sources (~14%) are classified as steep-spectrum sources. These sources have typical 0.5-2 keV luminosities of L(SX) ~ 1e44 erg/s and the majority of them are found at redshifts below z=1. In comparison with sources with flatter spectra, these sources have, on average, a UV (or optical) to 2 keV luminosity ratio that is larger by ~0.3 dex and bluer optical-to-UV continuum emission. They also appear to be radio quiet based on the detection rate in the FIRST and VLASS surveys. Their host galaxies -- at least in the redshift range of z=0.2-0.8, where the AGN-galaxy decomposition results from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging are available -- tend to be late-type and have smaller stellar masses than those of sources with flatter spectra. These properties are similar to those found in nearby narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, in agreement with the picture that they are AGN with elevated accretion rates and are in the early growth phase of black hole and galaxy co-evolution. However, the steep-spectrum sources are not exclusively narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies; indeed many are broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, as found by a catalogue search. This suggests that these steep-spectrum sources may be black holes generally with high accretion rates but of a wide mass range, including a few objects emitting at L(SX)>1e45 erg/s, of which black hole masses can be close to 10^9 M_sun. |
