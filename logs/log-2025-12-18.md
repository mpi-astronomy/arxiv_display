|**Abstract**|            The detection and characterization of protoplanets in protoplanetary disks around young stars is emerging as a transformative field that will redefine our understanding of how planetary systems form. While current facilities have revealed the diversity of mature exoplanets and the complex structures of disks, we still lack the crucial observational link between them: a statistically meaningful census of planets caught in the act of formation. This white paper argues that such a breakthrough requires access to the nearest and most informative star-forming regions, roughly half of which are poorly accessible or entirely unreachable from Cerro Armazones. Although the ELT alone will strongly impact our knowledge of planet formation, its location prevents Europe from fully exploiting the necessary parameter space. A 30-40 m telescope in the northern hemisphere is therefore essential for obtaining diffraction-limited imaging of protoplanets and disks across the entire sky, enabling robust demographics, exploiting synergies with ngVLA, Gaia, and other facilities covering the north, and ensuring that Europe remains at the forefront of the planet-formation revolution in the coming decades.         |

|**Abstract**|            Extended radio continuum emission and its linear polarization play a key role in probing large-scale structures of synchrotron and free-free emission in the Milky Way. Despite the existence of many radio continuum surveys, sensitive and high-angular-resolution single-dish surveys of extended radio continuum emission remain scarce. As part of the GLObal view of STAR formation (GLOSTAR) survey, we will also crucially complement the existing data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) by addressing the missing zero-spacing gap. Within the framework of the GLOSTAR Galactic plane survey, we performed large-scale radio continuum imaging observations toward the Galactic plane in the range $-2^{\circ}< \ell <60^{\circ}$ and $|b|<1.1^{\circ}$, as well as the Cygnus X region with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope. We present the Effelsberg continuum survey at 4.89GHz and 6.82GHz including linear polarization with angular resolutions of 145$^{\prime\prime}$ and 106$^{\prime\prime}$, respectively. The survey has been corrected for missing large-scale emission using available low-angular-resolution surveys. Comparison with previous single-dish surveys indicates that our continuum survey represents the highest-quality single-dish data collected to date at this frequency. More than 90\% of the flux density missed by the VLA D-array data is effectively recovered by the Effelsberg continuum survey. The improved sensitivity and angular resolution of our survey enable reliable mapping of Galactic magnetic field structures, with polarization data that are less affected by depolarization than in previous surveys. The GLOSTAR single-dish continuum data will be released publicly, offering a valuable resource for studying extended objects including HII regions, supernova remnants, diffuse interstellar medium, and Galactic structure.

|**Abstract**|            JWST offers an unprecedented view of optically dark or faint galaxies (OFGs), previously missed by HST. They are likely massive, heavily dust-obscured star-forming galaxies (SFGs) that substantially contribute to the cosmic SFR density at z > 3. To identify drivers of their high dust attenuation and their role in early universe galaxy evolution, we analyse the stellar morphology of 65 OFGs (from 1892 SFGs at 3<z<4) using NIRCAM/F444W imaging from the PRIMER and CEERS fields. We study correlations between dust attenuation ($A_{v}$) and galaxy properties, like stellar mass, size, and orientation, and compare scaling relations between OFGs and typical SFGs. We find that OFGs are ~8-9 times more massive and ~4 times more dust attenuated than the parent sample. Structurally, OFGs resemble parent SFGs in median $R_e$ and median $\Sigma_{R_e}$ but may be slightly rounder on average. While $A_v$ strongly correlates with stellar mass, it does not show significant dependence on stellar mass-normalised effective radius and stellar mass surface density, Sérsic index, axis ratio, or SFR surface density. The mass-size and mass-surface density relations place OFGs as a higher-mass extension of SFGs, with no concrete proof of evolutionary differences between them. This suggests that OFGs are heavily dust-obscured primarily due to their high stellar masses, which facilitates dust production and retention, with older stellar populations likely contributing as well. Although some OFGs exhibit high $\Sigma_\mathrm{R_e}$ and occupy regions of the mass-size plane similar to quiescent galaxies, the overall sample is not representative of this. Their current structures resemble typical SFGs, with no concrete signs of rapid compaction. Diversity in their physical properties shows that OFGs span a range of evolutionary states with few showing reduced star formation, while most remain actively star-forming.         |

|**Abstract**|            In this study we perform a comparative analysis of the properties of the HII regions located in different areas of barred galaxies, with the aim of investigating the impact of bars on the physical properties of the ionised gas. Based on integral field spectroscopy data for 17 barred galaxies covering approximately the central 6x6 kpc, we detect a total of 2200 HII regions, of which 331 are located within the nuclear disc (also known as circumnuclear regions), 661 in the bar region, and 1208 in the disc. Among the physical properties of the HII regions, we explore the O/H and N/O abundances, H$\alpha$ luminosity, dust extinction, electron density, and H$\alpha$ equivalent width. We find clear differences in the properties of the HII regions between the nuclear disc, the bar and the disc, that could be explained by an enhancement in the molecular gas concentration in the central parts driven by bar-induced gas flows. As this gas is channelled towards the galaxy centre, the most extreme values in the analysed properties are found for the circumnuclear HII regions. Unlike the bar strength, galaxy mass does seem to affect the properties of the HII regions, with massive galaxies presenting higher values in most of the properties, possibly due to the increased amount of gas in these systems. This study provides evidence that the bar-driven redistribution of material within the galaxy inner parts causes significant differences in the HII region properties depending on their location within the galaxies.         |

|**Abstract**|            Small Solar system Objects (SSOs) preserve the physical, chemical, and dynamical signatures of the Sun's protoplanetary disk. Upcoming surveys will discover vast numbers of new objects, yet their scientific value will depend on follow-up observations requiring far greater sensitivity and resolution than those currently available. A 30-m class telescope like the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will be transformative, but its Southern location will leave significant regions of the sky poorly covered or even non accessible. A Northern 30-40m telescope is therefore essential to achieve full-sky coverage and fully exploit the small body discoveries of the 2030-2050 era, in particular for targets of opportunity or unexpected discoveries, like those of interstellar objects and potentially hazardous asteroids, as well as for distant trans-Neptunian objects and space mission targets.         |

|**Abstract**|            Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are dense, compact stellar systems only a few parsecs across, located at galaxy centers. Their small sizes make them difficult to resolve spatially. NSCs often coexist with massive black holes, and both trace the dynamical state and evolution of their host galaxies. Dense stellar environments such as NSCs are also ideal sites for forming intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). To date, spatially resolved NSC properties, crucial for reconstructing dynamical and star-formation histories, have only been obtained for galaxies within 5 Mpc, using the highest-resolution instruments on the current class of very large telescopes. This severely limits spectroscopic studies, and a systematic, unbiased survey has never been accomplished. Because the vast majority of known NSCs are located in the Northern Hemisphere, only a 30-m-class telescope in the North can provide the statistical power needed to study their physical properties and measure the mass of coexisting central black holes. We propose leveraging the capabilities of a 30-m-class Northern telescope to obtain the first comprehensive, spatially resolved survey of NSCs, finally allowing us to unveil their formation pathways and their yet unknown connection with central massive black holes.         |

|**Abstract**|            In solar atmosphere, magnetic reconnection alters the topological connectivity, and magnetic energy is released. However, the length change of the reconnecting structures has rarely been reported. To identify the evolution of the topological structures, we search for reconnection events which should satisfy 3 criteria. (1) Each event displays an explicit X-type configuration, and the configuration consists of two sets of independent atmospheric structures, (2) the reconnection process is clearly observed, and (3) the topological connectivity of the structures can be tracked from at least 5 minutes prior to the occurrence of magnetic reconnection to 5 minutes after the reconnection. In this work, 3 events are selected and studied. During the reconnection moment, the total length of the two topological structures in each event shortens suddenly, and the decrements for events 1--3 are 47 Mm, 3.7 Mm, and 8.2 Mm, respectively, implying that partial structures vanish observationally during magnetic reconnection process. Several possibilities about the vanishment, e.g. the shrinkage of the reconnecting structures due to magnetic tension, the bizarre change in the third dimension, and magnetic field annihilation, have been discussed.         |

|**Abstract**|            Sprawling, turbulent cloud formations dominate the meteorology of Jupiter's mid-to-high latitudes, known as Folded Filamentary Regions (FFRs). A multi-wavelength characterisation by Juno reveals the spatial distribution, vertical structure, and energetics of the FFRs. The cloud tops display multiple lobes of stratiform aerosols, separated by darker, cloud-free lanes, and embedded with smaller eddies and high-altitude cumulus clouds. These cyclonic FFRs are microwave-bright in shallow-sounding wavelengths ($p<5$ bars) and microwave-dark in deep-sounding wavelengths ($p>10$ bars), with the transition potentially associated with the water condensation layer (6-7 bars). Associating microwave contrasts with temperature anomalies, this implies despinning of cyclonic eddies above/below their mid-planes. Despite deep roots (being detectable in wavelengths sounding $\sim100$ bars), they are ``pancake vortices'' with horizontal extents at least an order of magnitude larger than their depth. In the northern hemisphere, FFRs are most common in cyclonic belts poleward of $40^\circ$N (all latitudes are planetocentric), particularly a North Polar Filamentary Belt (NPFB) near $66-70^\circ$N that defines the transition from organised belts/zones to the chaotic polar domain. This distribution explains the high lightning rates from $45-80^\circ$N, peaking in a belt poleward of $52.3^\circ$N, which may trace the availability of water for moist convection. Many observed lightning flashes can be associated to specific FFRs containing bright storms, but some FFRs display no activity, suggesting quiescent periods during storm evolution. Analogies to Earth's oceanic eddies suggest that cyclones deform isentropic surfaces at their midplanes, raising deep water-rich layers upwards to promote moist convection, release latent heat, and inject clouds into the upper troposphere.         |

|**Abstract**|            Star-forming dwarf galaxies in the local Universe, especially extremely metal-poor ones, can be considered analogous to early galaxies of the Epoch of Reionization (z >= 6). Currently available telescopes cannot adequately detect and measure heavy element recombination lines and certain faint collisionally excited lines, which are essential for exploring the effects and biases that potential inhomogeneities in electron temperature and density of the ionized gas may have on determining the chemical composition of these galaxies. On the other hand, the origin of very high-ionization lines (e.g. He II, [Ne V], C IV]) measured in the spectra of an important fraction of these objects remains unknown and a challenge to current stellar models, suggesting the presence of Population III-like stars and/or the existence of non-conventional ionizing sources. Obtaining very deep spectra for a selected sample of local star-forming dwarf galaxies would provide unprecedented constraints on their nature, ionization and true chemical abundances, and could change the metallicity scale we assume to understand the chemical evolution of galaxies over cosmic time.         |

|**Abstract**|            Over the last 15 years, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionized astrophysics by providing unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in observing the cold universe, including the formation of stars, planets, and galaxies. With groundbreaking discoveries ranging from the first detailed images of protoplanetary disks to the kinematics of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization, ALMA has showcased the vast discovery potential of the (sub-)mm wavelength regime. However, in another 15 years from now--in the 2040s--the science landscape will have changed dramatically as new major observational facilities will have started their operations or have come towards advanced maturity in their scientific outcome (e.g., JWST, Rubin Observatory, ELT, Euclid, Gaia, Plato, Ariel, Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, LiteBIRD, LISA, SKA and others). At the same time, ALMA's current Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade will have been in place for ~10 years, and ALMA itself will have been operational for 30 years. To fully exploit this era, the community needs a next-generation facility operating at (sub-)mm wavelengths with capabilities far beyond those possible within ALMA's current infrastructure. To this end, ALMA2040 is a community-driven initiative to define the key scientific questions of the 2040s and translate them into a technical vision for a next-generation transformational (sub-)millimeter facility. Our goal with this document is to summarize the current status of the effort, synthesize outcomes from the 2025 workshops, outline next steps toward a reference design concept, and invite broad participation from the global mm/sub-mm community to help shape this future facility. In the following we provide details on the process and scope. We invite everyone who wishes to join the effort and/or contribute to the dedicated White Papers planned for 2026.         |
