|**Abstract**| We searched the Gaia DR3 database for ultramassive white dwarfs with kinematics consistent with having escaped the nearby Hyades open cluster, identifying three such candidates. Two of these candidates have masses estimated from Gaia photometry of approximately 1.1 solar masses; their status as products of single stellar evolution that have escaped the cluster was deemed too questionable for immediate follow-up analysis. The remaining candidate has an expected mass >1.3 solar masses, significantly reducing the probability of it being an interloper. Analysis of follow-up Gemini GMOS spectroscopy for this source reveals a non-magnetized hydrogen atmosphere white dwarf with a mass and age consistent with having formed from a single star. Assuming a single-stellar evolution formation channel, we estimate a 97.8% chance that the candidate is a true escapee from the Hyades. With a determined mass of 1.317 solar masses, this is potentially the most massive known single-evolution white dwarf and is by far the most massive with a strong association with an open cluster. |

|**Abstract**| This study presents the first millimeter continuum mapping observations of two nearby galaxies, the starburst spiral galaxy NGC2146 and the dwarf galaxy NGC2976, at 1.15 mm and 2 mm using the NIKA2 camera on the IRAM 30m telescope, as part of the Guaranteed Time Large Project IMEGIN. These observations provide robust resolved information about the physical properties of dust in nearby galaxies by constraining their FIR-radio SED in the millimeter domain. After subtracting the contribution from the CO line emission, the SEDs are modeled spatially using a Bayesian approach. Maps of dust mass surface density, temperature, emissivity index, and thermal radio component of the galaxies are presented, allowing for a study of the relations between the dust properties and star formation activity (using observations at 24$\mu$m as a tracer). We report that dust temperature is correlated with star formation rate in both galaxies. The effect of star formation activity on dust temperature is stronger in NGC2976, an indication of the thinner interstellar medium of dwarf galaxies. Moreover, an anti-correlation trend is reported between the dust emissivity index and temperature in both galaxies. |
