|**Abstract**|            The Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) is predicted to find approximately 170 000 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses from its lifetime observation of 14 000 deg^2 of the sky. Detecting this many lenses by visual inspection with professional astronomers and citizen scientists alone is infeasible. Machine learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been used as an automated method of detecting strong lenses, and have proven fruitful in finding galaxy-galaxy strong lens candidates. We identify the major challenge to be the automatic detection of galaxy-galaxy strong lenses while simultaneously maintaining a low false positive rate. One aim of this research is to have a quantified starting point on the achieved purity and completeness with our current version of CNN-based detection pipelines for the VIS images of EWS. We select all sources with VIS IE < 23 mag from the Euclid Early Release Observation imaging of the Perseus field. We apply a range of CNN architectures to detect strong lenses in these cutouts. All our networks perform extremely well on simulated data sets and their respective validation sets. However, when applied to real Euclid imaging, the highest lens purity is just 11%. Among all our networks, the false positives are typically identifiable by human volunteers as, for example, spiral galaxies, multiple sources, and artefacts, implying that improvements are still possible, perhaps via a second, more interpretable lens selection filtering stage. There is currently no alternative to human classification of CNN-selected lens candidates. Given the expected 10^5 lensing systems in Euclid, this implies 10^6 objects for human classification, which while very large is not in principle intractable and not without precedent.         |

|| <mark>I. J. M. Crossfield</mark>, et al. -- incl., <mark>L. Kreidberg</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-27*|

|**Abstract**|            Sub-Neptunes - volatile-rich exoplanets smaller than Neptune - are intrinsically the most common type of planet known. However, the formation and nature of these objects, as well as the distinctions between sub-classes (if any), remain unclear. Two powerful tools to tease out the secrets of these worlds are measurements of (i) atmospheric composition and structure revealed by transit and/or eclipse spectroscopy, and (ii) mass, radius, and density revealed by transit photometry and Doppler spectroscopy. Here we present OrCAS, a survey to better elucidate the origins, compositions, and atmospheres of sub-Neptunes. This radial velocity survey uses a repeatable, quantifiable metric to select targets suitable for subsequent transmission spectroscopy and address key science themes about the atmospheric & internal compositions and architectures of these systems. Our survey targets 26 systems with transiting sub-Neptune planet candidates, with the overarching goal of increasing the sample of such planets suitable for subsequent atmospheric characterization. This paper lays out our survey's science goals, defines our target prioritization metric, and performs light-curve fits and statistical validation using existing TESS photometry and ground-based follow-up observations. Our survey serves to continue expanding the sample of small exoplanets with well-measured properties orbiting nearby bright stars, ensuring fruitful studies of these systems for many years to come.         |

|| <mark>R. Burn</mark>, et al. |

|**Abstract**|            The nature of sub-Neptunes remains unknown due to degeneracies in interior structure solutions. However, a statistical set of small planets with measured masses and radii has been compiled. It can be used to test the prediction of large water reservoirs on sub-Neptunes by planet formation theory. We want to find out whether this water reservoir is included in photoevaporative winds and how much of it can partition into the rocky and metallic interior. We couple the result of a planetary formation model to evolution models which assume perfect mixing of water with H/He in the envelope or complete segregation. For the mixed envelopes, we also include fractionation during photoevaporative mass-loss. Further, the effect of equilibrium dissolution of water into an assumed magma ocean and into the metallic core is studied for the first time in coupled formation-evolution models. Out of the tested scenarios, the mass-radius relation of exoplanets is best matched under the mixed assumption without water sequestration to the interior. We quantify the radius valley location and scaling with stellar mass. Fractionation is not found to significantly alter the composition of the planets for our initial conditions due to initially massive envelopes on all planets. In contrast, water sequestration has a profound effect on the radius evolution and compositional budget of the planets. The model predicts the preservation of large quantities of water even if the gaseous envelope is lost. Planets with corresponding bulk densities are not observed in comparably large numbers. By combining formation and evolution model, we probe a parameter space favored by core accretion theory. We conclude that the dissolution of different volatiles into the planetary interior and solidification of the magma ocean are natural next steps for comprehensive treatment of atmosphere-interior interaction.

|**Abstract**|            In an ongoing effort to understand planet formation the link between the chemistry of the protoplanetary disk and the properties of resulting planets have long been a subject of interest. These connections have generally been made between mature planets and young protoplanetary disks through the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. In a rare number of systems, young protoplanets have been found within their natal protoplanetary disks. These systems offer a unique opportunity to directly study the delivery of gas from the protoplanetary disk to the planet. In this work we post-process 3D numerical simulations of an embedded Jupiter-massed planet in its protoplanetary disk to explore the chemical evolution of gas as it flows from the disk to the planet. The relevant dust to this chemical evolution is assumed to be small, co-moving grains with a reduced dust-to-gas ratio indicative of the upper atmosphere of a protoplanetary disk. We find that as the gas enters deep into the planet's gravitational well, it warms significantly (up to $\sim 800$ K), releasing all of the volatile content from the ice phase. This change in phase can influence our understanding of the delivery of volatile species to the atmospheres of giant planets. The primary carbon, oxygen, and sulfur carrying ices: CO$_2$, H$_2$O, and H$_2$S are released into the gas phase and along with the warm gas temperatures near the embedded planets lead to the production of unique species like CS, SO, and SO$_2$ compared to the protoplanetary disk. We compute the column densities of SO, SO$_2$, CS, and H$_2$CS in our model and find that their values are consistent with previous observational studies.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-27*|

|**Abstract**|            Planet formation in the solar system was started when the first planetesimals were formed from the gravitational collapse of pebble clouds. Numerical simulations of this process, especially in the framework of streaming instability, produce various power laws for the initial mass function for planetesimals. While recent advances have shed light on turbulence and its role in particle clustering, a comprehensive theoretical framework linking turbulence characteristics to particle cluster properties and planetesimal mass function remains incomplete. Recently, a kinetic field theory for ensembles of point-like classical particles in or out of equilibrium has been applied to cosmic structure formation. This theory encodes the dynamics of a classical particle ensemble by a generating functional specified by the initial probability distribution of particles in phase space and their equations of motion. Here, we apply kinetic field theory to planetesimal formation. A model for the initial probability distribution of dust particles in phase space is obtained from a quasi-initial state for a three-dimensional streaming-instability simulation that is a particle distribution with velocities for gas and particles from the Nakagawa relations. The equations of motion are chosen for the simplest case of freely streaming particles. We calculate the non-linearly evolved density power spectrum of dust particles and find that it develops a universal $k^{-3}$ tail at small scales, suggesting scale-invariant structure formation below a characteristic and time-dependent length scale. Thus, the KFT analysis indicates that the initial state for streaming instability simulations does not impose a constraint on structure evolution during planetesimal formation.         |

|**Abstract**|            Using stellar kinematic data from Gaia DR3, we revisit constraints on black hole (BH) natal kicks from observed accreting and detached BH binaries. We compare the space velocities and Galactic orbits of a sample of 12 BHs in the Galactic disk with well-constrained distances to their local stellar populations, for which we obtain proper motions and radial velocities from Gaia DR3. Compared to most previous studies, we infer lower minimum kick velocities, because our modeling accounts for the fact that most BH binaries are old and have likely been kinematically heated by processes other than kicks. Nevertheless, we find that half of the BHs have at least weak evidence for a kick, being kinematically hotter than at least 68% of their local stellar populations. At least 4 BHs are kinematically hotter than 90% of their local stellar populations, suggesting they were born with kicks of $\gtrsim 100$ km s$^{-1}$. On the other hand, 6 BHs have kinematics typical of their local populations, disfavoring kicks of $\gtrsim 50$ km s$^{-1}$. For two BHs, V404 Cyg and VFTS 243, there is strong independent evidence for a very weak kick $\lesssim 10$ km s$^{-1}$. Our analysis implies that while some BHs must form with very weak kicks, it would be wrong to conclude that most BHs do, particularly given that selection biases favor weak kicks. Although the uncertainties on most individual BHs' kicks are still too large to assess whether the kick distribution is bimodal, the data are consistent with a scenario where some BHs form by direct collapse and receive weak kicks, and others form in supernovae and receive strong kicks.         |

|| Q. Zhai, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-27*|
|*Comments*| *23 pages, 15 figures, submitted to ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN) 2014C, primarily emphasizing the initial month after the explosion at approximately daily intervals. During this time, it was classified as a Type Ib SN exhibiting a notably higher peak luminosity ($L_{\rm peak}\approx4.3\times10^{42}\rm erg\,s^{-1}$), a faster rise to brightness ($t_{\rm rise} \approx 11.6$ d), and a more gradual dimming ($\Delta m_{15}^{V} \approx 0.48$ mag) compared to typical SNe Ib. Analysis of the velocity evolution over the first $\sim$ 20 days after the explosion supports the view that the absorption near 6200Å\,is due to high-velocity H$\alpha$ in the outer layers of the ejecta, indicating the presence of a small amount of hydrogen in the envelope of progenitor before the explosion. Assuming the peak luminosity is entirely attributed to radioactive decay, we estimate that 0.14 \Msun\,of \Nifs\,was synthesized in the explosion. However, this amount of nickel could no longer maintain observed brightness approximately ten days after peak luminosity, suggesting additional energy sources beyond radioactive decay. This supplementary energy likely originates from interaction with the circumstellar medium (CSM). Consequently, the timing of the SN-CSM interaction in SN 2014C may occur much earlier than the emergence of IIn-like features during the nebular phase.         |

|| Y. Shao, T.-Y. Sun, M.-L. Zhao, <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-27*|
|*Comments*| *10 pages, 7 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            The 21-cm forest, composed of spectral absorption features from high-redshift background radio sources, provides a unique probe for studying small-scale structures during the epoch of reionization. It is particularly sensitive to detecting small-scale structures and early heating processes. Despite the rich information contained in the 21-cm forest signal, the complexity of directly modeling the signal has led to a lack of effective analytical models. However, the one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest contains valuable information about the matter power spectrum, making analytical modeling feasible. This work employs an analytical modeling approach based on the halo model, which links the distribution of matter to dark matter halos, allowing for effective predictions of cosmic structure formation and its impact on the 21-cm signal. By considering various parameter scenarios within the halo model framework, particularly different dark matter particle masses and varying levels of cosmic heating, we can capture the complexities of small-scale structures and make the 1D power spectrum modeling applicable across a wide range of parameters. This method not only enhances our understanding of the 21-cm forest signal but also provides theoretical support for future observational data. Observing the 21-cm forest with large radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array, is anticipated to enable simultaneous exploration of dark matter properties and the heating history of the early universe.         |

|| Y. Li, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-27*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in ApJ. 34 pages, 25 figures, 7 tables*|
|**Abstract**|            Deuteration is sensitive to environmental conditions in star-forming regions. To investigate NH$_2$D chemistry, we compared the spatial distribution of ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$, NH$_3$(1,1) and NH$_3$(2,2) in 12 late-stage massive star-forming regions. By averaging several pixels along the spatial slices of ortho-NH$_2$D $1_{11}^s-1_{01}^a$, we obtained the deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$. In seven targets, the deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ shows a decreasing trend with increasing rotational temperature. This trend is less clear in the remaining five sources, likely due to limited spatial resolution. However, when considering all 12 sources together, the anticorrelation between NH$_3$ deuterium fractionation and rotational temperature becomes less significant, suggesting that other physical parameters may influence the fractionation. Additionally, we found that the region of highest deuterium fractionation of NH$_3$ is offset from the NH$_3$ peak in each source, likely because the temperature is higher near the NH$_3$ peaks and NH$_2$D may be depleted from the gas phase as the molecular cloud core evolves, as well as the increased release of CO from grains into the gas phase.         |

|| <mark>X. Zhang</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-27*|
|*Comments*| *11 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables*|
|**Abstract**|            There are hosts of surveys that will provide excellent data to search for and locate Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) at cosmological distances. The BINGO project is one such surveys, and this collaboration has already estimated a FRB detection rate that the project will yield with the main telescope helped by a set of outrigger stations. This paper aims to simulate and estimate the potential of FRBs in constraining our current cosmological model. We present a forecast of the future constraints that the BINGO FRB detections and localizations will have when added to other current cosmological datasets. We quantify the dispersion measure (DM) as a function of redshift ($z$) for the BINGO FRB mock sample. Furthermore, we use current datasets (Supernovae, Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and Cosmic Microwave Background data) prior to assessing the efficacy of constraining dark energy models using Monte Carlo methods. Our results show that spatially located BINGO FRB dataset will provide promising constraints on the population of host galaxies intrinsic DM and be able to measure the nuisance parameters present within a FRB cosmological analysis. Still, they will also provide alternative estimates on other parameters such as the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation of state. In particular, we should see that BINGO FRB data can put constraints on the degenerate $w-H_0$ plane, which the CMB is incapable of measuring, allowing FRBs to be a viable alternative to BAO to constrain the dark energy equation of state. We conclude that FRBs remain a promising future probe for cosmology and that the FRBs detected by the BINGO project will contribute significantly to our knowledge of the current cosmological model.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Mid-infrared ELT Imager and Spectrograph (METIS) is a first-generation instrument for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), Europe's next-generation 39 m ground-based telescope for optical and infrared wavelengths. METIS will offer diffraction-limited imaging, low- and medium-resolution slit spectroscopy, and coronagraphy for high-contrast imaging between 3 and 13 microns, as well as high-resolution integral field spectroscopy between 3 and 5 microns. The main METIS science goals are the detection and characterisation of exoplanets, the investigation of proto-planetary disks, and the formation of planets. The Single-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (SCAO) system corrects atmospheric distortions and is thus essential for diffraction-limited observations with METIS. Numerous challenging aspects of an ELT Adaptive Optics (AO) system are addressed in the mature designs for the SCAO control system and the SCAO hardware module: the complex interaction with the telescope entities that participate in the AO control, wavefront reconstruction with a fragmented and moving pupil, secondary control tasks to deal with differential image motion, non-common path aberrations and mis-registration. A K-band pyramid wavefront sensor and a GPU-based Real-Time Computer (RTC), tailored to the needs of METIS at the ELT, are core components. This current paper serves as a natural sequel to our previous work presented in Hippler et al. (2018). It includes updated performance estimations in terms of several key performance indicators, including achieved contrast curves. We outline all important design decisions that were taken, and present the major challenges we faced and the main analyses carried out to arrive at these decisions and eventually the final design. We also elaborate on our testing and verification strategy, and, last not least, comprehensively present the full design, hardware and software.         |
