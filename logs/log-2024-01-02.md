|**Abstract**| Utilizing observations from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST), Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A), we investigate the event from two distinct observational perspectives: on the solar disk using NVST and SDO, and on the solar limb using STEREO-A. We employ both a non-linear force-free field model and a potential field model to reconstruct the coronal magnetic field, aiming to understand its magnetic properties. Two precursor jet-like activities were observed before the eruption, displaying an untwisted rotation. The second activity released an estimated twist of over two turns. During these two jet-like activities, Y-shaped brightenings, newly emerging magnetic flux accompanied by magnetic cancellation, and the formation of newly moving fibrils were identified. Combining these observational features, it can be inferred that these two precursor jet-like activities released the magnetic field constraining the filament and were triggered by newly emerging magnetic flux. Before the filament eruption, it was observed that some moving flows had been ejected from the site as the onset of two jet-like activities, indicating the same physical process as two jet-like activities. Extrapolations revealed that the filament laid under the height of the decay index of 1.0 and had strong magnetic field (540 Gauss) and a high twisted number (2.4 turns) before the eruption. An apparent rotational motion was observed during the filament eruption. We deduce that the solar filament, exhibiting an inverted U-shape, is a significantly twisted flux rope. The eruption of the filament was initiated by the release of constraining magnetic fields through continuous magnetic reconnection. This reconnection process was triggered by the emergence of newly magnetic flux. |
