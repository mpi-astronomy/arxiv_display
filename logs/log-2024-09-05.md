|**Abstract**|            Terrestrial planets born beyond 1-3 AU have been theorized to avoid being engulfed during the red-giant phases of their host stars. Nevertheless, only a few gas-giant planets have been observed around white dwarfs (WDs) -- the end product left behind by a red giant. Here we report on evidence that the lens system that produced the microlensing event KMT-2020-BLG-0414 is composed of a WD orbited by an Earth-mass planet and a brown dwarf (BD) companion, as shown by the non-detection of the lens flux using Keck Adaptive Optics (AO). From microlensing orbital motion constraints, we determine the planet to be a $1.9\pm0.2$ Earth-mass ($M_\oplus$) planet at a physical separation of $2.1\pm0.2$ au from the WD during the event. By considering the system evolutionary history, we determine the BD companion to have a projected separation of 22 au from the WD, and reject an alternative model that places the BD at 0.2 au. Given planetary orbital expansion during the final evolutionary stages of the host star, this Earth-mass planet may have existed in an initial orbit close to 1 au, thereby offering a glimpse into the possible survival of planet Earth in the distant future.         |

|*Comments*| *21 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables Accepted for publication in ApJ (8/14/2024)*|
|**Abstract**|            The elemental and isotopic abundances of volatiles like carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen may trace a planet's formation location relative to H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, NH$_3$, and N$_2$ "snowlines", or the distance from the star at which these volatile elements sublimate. By comparing the C/O and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios measured in giant exoplanet atmospheres to complementary measurements of their host stars, we can determine whether the planet inherited stellar abundances from formation inside the volatile snowlines, or non-stellar C/O and $^{13}$C enrichment characteristic of formation beyond the snowlines. To date, there are still only a handful of exoplanet systems where we can make a direct comparison of elemental and isotopic CNO abundances between an exoplanet and its host star. Here, we present a $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C abundance analysis for host star WASP-77A (whose hot Jupiter's $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C abundance was recently measured). We use MARCS stellar atmosphere models and the radiative transfer code TurboSpectrum to generate synthetic stellar spectra for isotopic abundance calculations. We find a $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of $51\pm 6$ for WASP-77A, which is sub-solar ($\sim 91$) but may still indicate $^{13}$C-enrichment in its companion planet WASP-77A b ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = 26 $\pm$ 16, previously reported). Together with the inventory of carbon and oxygen abundances in both the host and companion planet, these chemical constraints point to WASP-77A b's formation beyond the H$_2$O and CO$_2$ snowlines and provide chemical evidence for the planet's migration to its current location $\sim$0.024 AU from its host star.         |

|| L. Wang, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark>, <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-09-05*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            Optically observing and monitoring moving objects, both natural and artificial, is important to human space security. Non-sidereal tracking can improve the system's limiting magnitude for moving objects, which benefits the surveillance. However, images with non-sidereal tracking include complex background, as well as objects with different brightness and moving mode, posing a significant challenge for accurate multi-object detection in such images, especially in wide field of view (WFOV) telescope images. To achieve a higher detection precision in a higher speed, we proposed a novel object detection method, which combines the source feature extraction and the neural network. First, our method extracts object features from optical images such as centroid, shape, and flux. Then it conducts a naive labeling based on those features to distinguish moving objects from stars. After balancing the labeled data, we employ it to train a neural network aimed at creating a classification model for point-like and streak-like objects. Ultimately, based on the neural network model's classification outcomes, moving objects whose motion modes consistent with the tracked objects are detected via track association, while objects with different motion modes are detected using morphological statistics. The validation, based on the space objects images captured in target tracking mode with the 1-meter telescope at Nanshan, Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory, demonstrates that our method achieves 94.72% detection accuracy with merely 5.02% false alarm rate, and a processing time of 0.66s per frame. Consequently, our method can rapidly and accurately detect objects with different motion modes from wide-field images with non-sidereal tracking.         |

|| Y. Huang, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-09-05*|
|*Comments*| *4 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, in response to Dehnen et al. (arXiv:2407.06341)*|
|**Abstract**|            In this reply, we present a comprehensive analysis addressing the concerns raised by Dehnen et al. (2024) regarding our recent measurement of the disk warp precession using the `motion-picture' method (Huang et al. 2024). We carefully examine the impact of ignoring the twist of the disk warp and the so-called $R$-$\tau$ correlation on the estimation of the precession rate. The results indicate that the effect is minor and does not exceed the systematic and statistical uncertainties. Using N-body+SPH simulation data, we confirm that the `motion-picture' technique is effective in measuring retrograde precession of disk warp in stellar populations younger than 170 Myr, similar to classical Cepheids. Therefore, the overall conclusions of Huang et al. (2024) remain robust.         |

|| F. Fontanot, et al. -- incl., <mark>L. Xie</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-09-05*|
|*Comments*| *10 Pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, 1 appendix - A&A submitted*|
|**Abstract**|            We present results from the latest version of the GAEA model of galaxy formation coupled with merger trees extracted from the P-Millennium Simulation (PMS), which provides a better mass resolution, a larger volume and assumes cosmological parameters consistent with latest results from the Planck mission. The model includes, at the same time, a treatment for the partition of cold gas into atomic and molecular (H$_2$) components; a better treatment for environmental processes acting on satellite galaxies; an updated modelling of cold gas accretion on Super-Massive Black Hole and relative AGN feedback on the host galaxy. We compare GAEA predictions based on the PMS, with model realizations based on other simulations in the Millennium Suite at different resolution, showing that the new model provides a remarkable consistency in the statistical properties of galaxy populations. We interpret this as due to the interplay between AGN feedback and H$_2$-based SFR (both acting as regulators of the cold gas content). We then compare model predictions with available data for the galaxy 2-point correlation function (2pCF) in the redshift range 0<z<3. We show that GAEA runs are able to correctly recover the main dependencies of the 2pCF as a function of stellar mass (M$_\star$), star formation activity, HI-content and redshift for M$_\star$ < 10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$ galaxies. Our model correctly captures both the distribution of galaxy populations in the Large Scale Structure and the interplay between the main physical processes regulating their baryonic content, both for central and satellite galaxies. At larger stellar masses GAEA underpredicts the 2pCF amplitude, suggesting that model massive galaxies live in less massive dark matter haloes. The model predicts a rather small redshift evolution of the clustering amplitude up to z$\sim$3, consistent with available observational evidence.         |

|| E. Collaboration, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. Jahnke</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-09-05*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            We investigate the level of accuracy and precision of cluster weak-lensing (WL) masses measured with the \Euclid data processing pipeline. We use the DEMNUni-Cov $N$-body simulations to assess how well the WL mass probes the true halo mass, and, then, how well WL masses can be recovered in the presence of measurement uncertainties. We consider different halo mass density models, priors, and mass point estimates. WL mass differs from true mass due to, e.g., the intrinsic ellipticity of sources, correlated or uncorrelated matter and large-scale structure, halo triaxiality and orientation, and merging or irregular morphology. In an ideal scenario without observational or measurement errors, the maximum likelihood estimator is the most accurate, with WL masses biased low by $\langle b_M \rangle = -14.6 \pm 1.7 \, \%$ on average over the full range $M_\text{200c} > 5 \times 10^{13} \, M_\odot$ and $z < 1$. Due to the stabilising effect of the prior, the biweight, mean, and median estimates are more precise. The scatter decreases with increasing mass and informative priors significantly reduce the scatter. Halo mass density profiles with a truncation provide better fits to the lensing signal, while the accuracy and precision are not significantly affected. We further investigate the impact of additional sources of systematic uncertainty on the WL mass, namely the impact of photometric redshift uncertainties and source selection, the expected performance of \Euclid cluster detection algorithms, and the presence of masks. Taken in isolation, we find that the largest effect is induced by non-conservative source selection. This effect can be mostly removed with a robust selection. As a final \Euclid-like test, we combine systematic effects in a realistic observational setting and find results similar to the ideal case, $\langle b_M \rangle = - 15.5 \pm 2.4 \, \%$, under a robust selection.         |
