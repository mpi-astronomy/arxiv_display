|**Abstract**|            The James Webb Space telescope has discovered an abundant population of broad line emitters, typical signposts for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Many of these sources have red colors and a compact appearance that has led to naming them `Little Red Dots'. In this paper we develop a detailed framework to estimate the photometry of AGN embedded in galaxies extracted from the Obelisk cosmological simulation to understand the properties of color-selected Little Red Dots (cLRDs) in the context of the full AGN and massive black hole population. We find that using realistic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and attenuation for AGN we can explain the shape of the cLRD SED as long as galaxies host a sufficiently luminous AGN that is not too much or too little attenuated. When attenuation is too low or too high, AGN do not enter the cLRD selection, because the AGN dominates over the host galaxy too much in blue filters, or it does not contribute to photometry anywhere, respectively. cLRDs are also characterized by high Eddington ratios, possibility super-Eddington, and/or high ratios between black hole and stellar mass.         |

|**Abstract**|            NEXUS is a JWST Multi-Cycle (Cycles 3-5; 368 primary hrs) GO Treasury imaging and spectroscopic survey around the North Ecliptic Pole. It contains two overlapping tiers. The Wide tier ($\sim 400~{\rm arcmin}^2$) performs NIRCam/WFSS 2.4-5 micron grism spectroscopy with three epochs over 3 years (final continuum ${\rm S/N/pixel>3}$ at F444W$<22.2$). The Deep tier ($\sim 50~{\rm arcmin}^2$) performs high-multiplexing NIRSpec 0.6-5.3 micron MOS/PRISM spectroscopy for $\sim 10,000$ targets, over 18 epochs with a 2-month cadence (epoch/final continuum ${\rm S/N/pixel>3}$ at F200W$\lesssim 27/29$). All epochs have simultaneous multi-band NIRCam and MIRI imaging ($5\sigma$ final depths of $\sim 28-29$ in NIRCam and $\sim 25$ in MIRI). The field is within the continuous viewing zone of JWST, and is fully covered by the Euclid Ultra-Deep Field, with 0.9-2 micron deep Euclid spectroscopy and cadenced photometry. NEXUS has three science pillars. First, with its massive and nearly complete (flux-limited) spectroscopic samples and deep photometry, it will perform efficient classification and physical characterization of galaxies and AGNs from $z\sim 1$ to Cosmic Dawn. With the large contiguous area coverage, it will measure the spatial clustering and demography of the first galaxies and SMBHs at $z>6$. Second, multi-epoch observations enable systematic time-domain investigations, focusing on $z>3$ transients and low-mass AGN reverberation mapping. Third, the comprehensive data set will enable knowledge transfer to other legacy fields, create data challenges, and initiate benchmark work for future space missions. With rapid public releases of processed data and an open invitation for collaboration, NEXUS aims for broad and swift community engagement, to become a powerhouse to drive transformative advancements in multiple key science areas of astronomy.         |

|**Abstract**|            Variable stars in stellar clusters can offer key constraints on stellar evolution and pulsation models, utilising estimates of host cluster properties to constrain stellar physical parameters. We present a catalogue of 86 luminous (F814W<19) variable stars in M31 clusters identified by mining the archival Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey using a combination of statistical analysis of sparse PHAT light curves and difference imaging. We determine the evolutionary phases and initial masses of these variable stars by matching them with theoretical isochrones generated using host cluster properties from the literature. We calculate the probability of PHAT photometry being blended due to the highly crowded nature of cluster environments for each cluster-variable star, using these probabilities to inform our level of confidence in the derived properties of each star. Our 86 cluster-variable stars have initial masses between 0.8--67 $M_{\odot}$. Their evolutionary phases span the main sequence, more evolved hydrogen- and helium-burning phases, and the post-asymptotic giant branch. We identify numerous candidate variable star types: RV Tauri variables, red supergiants and slowly pulsating B-type supergiants, along with Wolf Rayet stars, $\alpha$ Cygni and Mira variables, a classical Cepheid and a possible super-asymptotic giant. We characterise 12 cluster-variable stars at higher confidence based on their difference image quality and lower blending probability. Ours is the first systematic study of variable stars in extragalactic stellar clusters leveraging the superior resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope and demonstrating the unique power of stellar clusters in constraining the fundamental properties of variable stars.         |

|**Abstract**|            In this study, we conducted simulations to find the geometric aberrations expected for images taken by the Main Survey Camera (MSC) of the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) due to its motion. As anticipated by previous work, our findings indicate that the geometric distortion of light impacts the focal plane's apparent scale, with a more pronounced influence as the size of the focal plane increases. Our models suggest that the effect consistently influences the pixel scale in both the vertical and parallel directions. The apparent scale variation follows a sinusoidal distribution throughout one orbit period. Simulations reveal that the effect is particularly pronounced in the center of the Galaxy and gradually diminishes along the direction of ecliptic latitude. At low ecliptic latitudes, the total aberration leads to about 0.94 pixels offset (a 20-minute exposure) and 0.26 pixels offset (a 300-second exposure) at the edge of the field of view, respectively. Appropriate processings for the geometric effect during the CSST pre- and post-observation phases are presented.         |

|**Abstract**|            Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are an important component of the interstellar medium of galaxies and photochemistry plays a key role in the evolution of these species in space. Here, we explore the photofragmentation behaviour of the coronene cation (C24H12+) using time of flight mass spectrometry. The experiments show photodissociation fragmentation channels including the formation of bare carbon clusters (Cn+) and hydrocarbon chains (CnHx+). The mass spectrum of coronene is dominated by peaks from C11+ and C7H+. Density functional theory was used to calculate relative energies, potential dissociation pathways, and possible structures for relevant species. We identify 6-6 to 5-7 ring isomerisation as a key step in the formation of both the bare carbon clusters and the hydrocarbon chains observed in this study. We present the dissociation mechanism outlined here as a potential formation route for C60 and other astrochemically relevant species.         |
