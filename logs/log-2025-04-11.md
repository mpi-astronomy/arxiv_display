|**Abstract**|            The IRAS01425+2902 wide binary system was recently reported to have both a young planet and a puzzling geometric arrangement, where the planet and binary both orbit edge-on, but misaligned by 60 deg to the circumprimary disc. This is the youngest transiting planet yet to be detected but its misalignment to the disc is difficult to explain. In this paper we explore the dissolution of an unstable triple system as a potential mechanism to produce this system. We simulate the effects of an ejection interaction in models using a highly inclined, retrograde flyby centred on the primary star of IRAS01425. The escaping star of ~0.35 solar masses inclines both the disc and binary orbits such that they have a relative misalignment of greater than 60 deg, as inferred from observations. The planet orbit also becomes inclined relative to the disc, and our interpretation predicts that the binary should have a highly eccentric orbit (e > 0.5 from our simulations). We additionally demonstrate that despite the high relative misalignment of the disc it is unlikely to be vulnerable to von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov oscillations.         |
