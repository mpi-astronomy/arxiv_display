|**Abstract**|            Stars and planets form, live, and evolve in unison. Throughout the life of a star, dusty circumstellar discs and stellar outflows influence the further evolution of both the star(s) and their orbiting planet(s). Planet-forming discs, winds of red giant branch (RGB) or asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and post-RGB/post-AGB discs are examples of such host environments where dust physics plays a key role. The physical processes that occur during each of these stages establishes how the Solar System as well as exoplanetary systems were formed, are evolving, and will eventually die. This White Paper aims to bridge the fields of stellar evolution and planet formation by peering into the dust kinematics and macrostructure formation, and its effect on planet-host interaction, in dusty environments from stellar birth to death. Near-future advancements in the 2030s will enable the detection, orbital monitoring and atmospheric/mineralogical characterisation of close-in (proto)planets across diverse stages of stellar evolution. To take full advantage of these developments by the 2040s, we should develop the capabilities required to image the varied dusty environments in which planets are entrained over their lifetime. This will enable extensive testing of current theoretical understandings - from the micro-scales of dust assembly to the deeply interlinked macro-scales of planet-host interactions - across diverse settings often too small, distant, and faint to be resolved in the next decade, simultaneously providing valuable constraints on the two-way interplay of dusty host environments and planetary formation/evolution.         |

|**Abstract**|            Studying young protoplanetary disks is essential for understanding planet formation, but traditional angular differential imaging can introduce self-subtraction artefacts that hinder interpretation of small-scale structures. We present high-resolution total- and polarized-intensity Ks-band images of the LkCa~15 system obtained with SPHERE using near-simultaneous reference-star differential imaging (star-hopping), yielding self-subtraction-free images beyond 0.1 arcsec. LkCa~15 hosts a ~160 au protoplanetary disk and has previously been reported to harbour candidate protoplanets at separations of 15--18 au. We analyse the disk morphology and dust properties and search for super-Jupiter planets beyond 20 au. We first model the near-infrared scattered-light images together with ALMA submillimetre continuum data using RADMC-3D and a two grain-size (micron and millimetre) compact olivine model. While this model broadly reproduces the disk geometry, it overpredicts the degree of forward scattering in the near-infrared. To investigate this discrepancy, we extract the scattering phase function S(theta) and polarized fraction P(theta) from the SPHERE data and compare them with aggregate-scattering models. The observed phase functions disfavour compact Mie spheres and are better matched by porous aggregates (CAHP). Recomputing the scattered-light models with porous CAHP grains in the disk surface layer significantly improves agreement with the observed Ks-band morphology and polarization, while retaining compact millimetre grains to reproduce the ALMA continuum. No new planetary companions are detected; we place upper mass limits of ~1.5 MJ beyond 200 au and ~3.6 MJ in the inner disk. Our results demonstrate that combining star-hopping imaging with phase-function diagnostics provides strong constraints on dust grain properties in protoplanetary disks.         |

|| N. Kosogorov, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Shi</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-12-23*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal (ApJ). 19 pages, 6 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            We report on a search for prompt, low-frequency radio emission from the gravitational-wave (GW) merger S250206dm using the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA). Early alerts favored a neutron-star-containing merger, making this a compelling target. Motivated by theoretical predictions of coherent radio bursts from mergers involving a neutron star, we utilized the OVRO-LWA Time Machine system to analyze voltage data recorded around the time of the event. The Time Machine is a two-stage voltage buffer and processing pipeline that continuously buffers raw data from all antennas across the array's nearly full-hemisphere instantaneous field of view, enabling retrospective beamforming, dedispersion, and fast-transient candidate identification. For this event, we analyzed a 30-minute interval beginning 3.5 minutes after the merger, which included two minutes of pre-alert data recovered by the ring buffer. We searched the 50% localization probability region with millisecond time resolution in the 69-86 MHz frequency band. No radio counterpart was detected above a 7-sigma fluence detection threshold of ~150 Jy ms. Using Bayesian analysis, we place a 95% confidence upper limit on the source luminosity of L95 = 4 x 10^41 erg s^-1. These constraints start to probe the bright end of the coherent-emission parameter space predicted by jet-ISM shock processes, magnetar and blitzar-like mechanisms, and recent simulation-based scenarios for neutron-star-containing mergers. This study presents the first sensitive, large-area, millisecond-timescale search for prompt low-frequency radio emission from a GW merger with the OVRO-LWA, establishing a framework in which about ten additional events will yield stringent population-level constraints.         |

|| E. Meyer-Hofmeister, <mark>Y. Wang</mark>, B. F. Liu |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-12-23*|

|**Abstract**|            We investigate the accretion geometry in neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in the hard spectral state. It is commonly accepted that, for low mass transfer rates, an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) is present in the inner region. But the observed relativistically broadened emission lines in the reflection spectra clearly indicate the existence of discs near the innermost stable circular orbit $(R_{\rm{ISCO}})$. We investigate the interaction between the coronal flow and the disc in neutron star LMXBs, and find that gas condensation from the dominant, coronal accretion flow to an inner disc is enhanced as compared to that in black hole LMXBs as a consequence of irradiation of the corona by the neutron star surface. Computations show that for low mass transfer rates ($\sim 0.005-0.02$ Eddington rate) a persistent weak disc can coexist with a coronal flow in the innermost region, where a pure ADAF would have been expected. The inner disc extends outwards from $R_{\rm{ISCO}}$ to $\sim 10 R_{\rm{ISCO}}$ for Eddington ratios ($L/L_{\rm{Edd}}$) as low as $\sim 0.002$, covers a larger region for higher Eddington ratios, and eventually connects to the outer disc at $L/L_{\rm{Edd}} \sim 0.02$, thereby transiting to a soft state. We demonstrate that the observationally inferred region of the broad iron lines in the hard-state sources generally lies within the extension of the inner discs predicted by the condensation model. Disappearance of the broad iron lines is predicted at very low luminosities, either caused by very low accretion rates or disc truncation by strong magnetic fields.         |

|| <mark>S. Kumar</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-12-23*|
|*Comments*| *8 pages, 2 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            We investigate a natural extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, the $\Omega_1\Omega_2$-$\Lambda$CDM model, in which the total energy density of the universe is expanded in powers of $1+z$. This parameterization recovers the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario and introduces two additional, observationally testable contributions to the dark energy sector, $\Omega_1(1+z)$ and $\Omega_2(1+z)^2$, alongside the cosmological constant. Using Planck CMB and DESI BAO data, we find that this framework is suitable for relaxing the Hubble tension. The Planck CMB data alone allow substantial freedom in late-time dynamics, yielding $H_0 = 75.4^{+3.9}_{-2.3}\;\mathrm{km\;s^{-1}\;Mpc^{-1}}$, fully consistent with distance-ladder measurements from the SH0ES collaboration. When DESI BAO data are included in the analysis, the late-time expansion history becomes more tightly anchored, reducing the $H_0$ discrepancy to $\sim 2.5\sigma$ level. This highlights the limited constraining power of currently available low-redshift data measurements, especially in the context of the $\Omega_1\Omega_2$-$\Lambda$CDM model, where dynamical dark energy dominates the background expansion over a relatively large redshift range. The model naturally exhibits a smooth quintessence--phantom transition followed by asymptotic de Sitter behavior of the dark energy equation of state, alters late-time cosmic dynamics, and preserves standard early-universe physics. Overall, our results demonstrate that controlled late-time deviations from $\Lambda$CDM can improve cosmological concordance.         |

|| S. Pei, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-12-23*|
|*Comments*| *12 pages, 4 figures. Accepted by Astronomy and Astrophysics*|
|**Abstract**|            We present a multi-wavelength study of the symbiotic recurrent nova (RN) T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) using Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) / X-Ray Telescope (XRT) / UltraViolet Optical Telescope (UVOT) and American Association of Variable Stars Observers (AAVSO) observations from 2005 to 2025. Our analysis spans quiescent, high, and pre-eruption dip states. We find that brightening amplitudes increase toward shorter wavelengths in both optical and UV bands, while the UV and X-ray fluxes are generally anti-correlated throughout all phases. During the 2023-2024 pre-eruption dip, soft and hard X-rays increased as optical and ultraviolet (UV) brightness declined, consistent with a transition from an optically thick to thin boundary layer driven by a reduction in the accretion rate. We also report, for the first time, a second, lower-amplitude dip occurring between September 2024 and February 2025 following the primary 2023-2024 pre-eruption dip. The observed variability supports an accretion-variation scenario as a unifying explanation for both the high and dip states, and may signal an imminent nova eruption.         |

|| T. Urrutia, et al. -- incl., <mark>E. Bañados</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-12-23*|
|*Comments*| *White paper in response to ESO's "Expanding Horizons" call*|
|**Abstract**|            We propose a large quasar demographic optical multi-object spectroscopic (MOS) survey targeting over 50 million AGN candidates up to the highest redshifts possible in the optical (z~6.5), with repeat visits, using a variety of selection criteria available by 2040. A large MOS survey combining all AGN selection methods is the only way to unify a diverse range of different obscured AGN populations within a single, variability- and spectroscopy-based framework, rather than as disjoint classes selected by different methods.         |
