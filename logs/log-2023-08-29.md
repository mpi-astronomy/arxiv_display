|**Abstract**| During the journey from the cloud to the disc, the chemical composition of the protostellar envelope material can be either preserved or processed to varying degrees depending on the surrounding physical environment. This works aims to constrain the interplay of solid (ice) and gaseous methanol (CH$_3$OH) in the outer regions of protostellar envelopes located in the Coronet cluster in Corona Australis (CrA), and assess the importance of irradiation by the Herbig Ae/Be star R CrA. CH$_3$OH is a prime test-case as it predominantly forms as a consequence of the solid-gas interplay (hydrogenation of condensed CO molecules onto the grain surfaces) and it plays an important role in future complex molecular processing. We present 1.3 mm Submillimeter Array (SMA) and Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) observations towards the envelopes of four low-mass protostars in the Coronet. Eighteen molecular transitions of seven species are identified. We calculate CH$_3$OH gas-to-ice ratios in this strongly irradiated cluster and compare them with ratios determined towards protostars located in less irradiated regions such as the Serpens SVS 4 cluster in Serpens Main and the Barnard 35A cloud in the $\lambda$ Orionis region. The CH$_3$OH gas-to-ice ratios in the Coronet vary by one order of magnitude (from 1.2$\times$10$^{-4}$ to 3.1$\times$10$^{-3}$) which is similar to less irradiated regions as found in previous studies. We find that the CH$_3$OH gas-to-ice ratios estimated in these three regions are remarkably similar despite the different UV radiation field intensities and formation histories. This result suggests that the overall CH$_3$OH chemistry in the outer regions of low-mass envelopes is relatively independent of variations in the physical conditions and hence that it is set during the prestellar stage. |

|**Abstract**| Accretion plays a central role in the physics that governs the evolution and dispersal of protoplanetary disks. The primary goal of this paper is to analyze the stability over time of the mass accretion rate onto TW Hya, the nearest accreting solar-mass young star. We measure veiling across the optical spectrum in 1169 archival high-resolution spectra of TW Hya, obtained from 1998--2022. The veiling is then converted to accretion rate using 26 flux-calibrated spectra that cover the Balmer jump. The accretion rate measured from the excess continuum has an average of $2.51\times10^{-9}$~M$_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$ and a Gaussian distribution with a FWHM of 0.22 dex. This accretion rate may be underestimated by a factor of up to 1.5 because of uncertainty in the bolometric correction and another factor of 1.7 because of excluding the fraction of accretion energy that escapes in lines, especially Ly$\alpha$. The accretion luminosities are well correlated with He line luminosities but poorly correlated with H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ luminosity. The accretion rate is always flickering over hours but on longer timescales has been stable over 25 years. This level of variability is consistent with previous measurements for most, but not all, accreting young stars. |

|**Abstract**| The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) ushers in a new era of astronomical observation and discovery, offering unprecedented precision in a variety of measurements such as photometry, astrometry, morphology, and shear measurement. Accurate point spread function (PSF) models are crucial for many of these measurements. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid PSF construction method called HybPSF for JWST NIRCam imaging data. HybPSF combines the WebbPSF software, which simulates the PSF for JWST, with observed data to produce more accurate and reliable PSF models. We apply this method to the SMACS J0723 imaging data and construct supplementary structures from residuals obtained by subtracting the WebbPSF PSF model from the data. Our results show that HybPSF significantly reduces discrepancies between the PSF model and the data compared to WebbPSF. Specifically, the PSF shape parameter ellipticity and size comparisons indicate that HybPSF improves precision by a factor of approximately 10 for \$R^2\$ and \$50\%\$ for \$e\$. This improvement has important implications for astronomical measurements using JWST NIRCam imaging data. |

|**Abstract**| At $z \lesssim 1$, shock heating caused by large-scale velocity flows and possibly violent feedback from galaxy formation, converts a significant fraction of the cool gas ($T\sim 10^4$ K) in the intergalactic medium (IGM) into warm-hot phase (WHIM) with $T >10^5$K, resulting in a significant deviation from the previously tight power-law IGM temperature-density relationship, $T=T_0 (\rho / {\bar{\rho}})^{\gamma -1}$. This study explores the impact of the WHIM on measurements of the low-$z$ IGM thermal state, $[T_0,\gamma]$, based on the $b$-$N_{H I}$ distribution of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. Exploiting a machine learning-enabled simulation-based inference method trained on Nyx hydrodynamical simulations, we demonstrate that [$T_0$, $\gamma$] can still be reliably measured from the $b$-$N_{H I}$ distribution at $z=0.1$, notwithstanding the substantial WHIM in the IGM. To investigate the effects of different feedback, we apply this inference methodology to mock spectra derived from the IllustrisTNG and Illustris simulations at $z=0.1$. The results suggest that the underlying $[T_0,\gamma]$ of both simulations can be recovered with biases as low as $|\Delta \log(T_0/\text{K})| \lesssim 0.05$ dex, $|\Delta \gamma | \lesssim 0.1$, smaller than the precision of a typical measurement. Given the large differences in the volume-weighted WHIM fractions between the three simulations (Illustris 38\%, IllustrisTNG 10\%, Nyx 4\%) we conclude that the $b$-$N_{H I}$ distribution is not sensitive to the WHIM under realistic conditions. Finally, we investigate the physical properties of the detectable Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers, and discover that although their $T$ and $\Delta$ distributions remain mostly unaffected by feedback, they are correlated with the photoionization rate used in the simulation. |
