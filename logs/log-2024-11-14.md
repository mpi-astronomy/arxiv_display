|**Abstract**|            In this paper, we developed a spectral emulator based on the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory Stellar Library (MaStar) and a grouping optimization strategy to estimate effective temperature (T_eff), surface gravity (log g), metallicity ([Fe/H]) and the abundance of alpha elements with respect to iron ([alpha/Fe]) for O-M-type stars within the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) low-resolution spectra. The primary aim is to use a rapid spectral-fitting method, specifically the spectral emulator with the grouping optimization strategy, to create a comprehensive catalog for stars of all types within LAMOST, addressing the shortcomings in parameter estimations for both cold and hot stars present in the official LAMOST AFGKM-type catalog. This effort is part of our series of studies dedicated to establishing an empirical spectral library for LAMOST. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effectively applicable to parameter prediction for LAMOST, with the single-machine processing time within $70$ hr. We observed that the internal error dispersions for T_eff, log g, [Fe/H], and [alpha/Fe] across different spectral types lie within the ranges of $15-594$ K, $0.03-0.27$ dex, $0.02-0.10$ dex, and $0.01-0.04$ dex, respectively, indicating a good consistency. A comparative analysis with external data highlighted deficiencies in the official LAMOST catalog and issues with MaStar parameters, as well as potential limitations of our method in processing spectra with strong emission lines and bad pixels.

|| <mark>J. Liu</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-14*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            In astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs), neutrinos potentially experience substantial flavor mixing due to the refractive effects of neutrino self-interactions. Determining the survival probability of neutrinos in asymptotic states is paramount to incorporating flavor conversions' effects in the theoretical modeling of CCSN and BNSM. Some phenomenological schemes have shown good performance in approximating asymptotic states of fast neutrino-flavor conversions (FFCs), known as one of the collective neutrino oscillation modes induced by neutrino self-interactions. However, a recent study showed that they would yield qualitatively different asymptotic states of FFC if the neutrino number is forced to evolve. It is not yet fully understood why the canonical phenomenological models fail to predict asymptotic states. In this paper, we perform detailed investigations through numerical simulations and then provide an intuitive explanation with a quasi-homogeneous analysis. Based on the analysis, we propose a new phenomenological model, in which the quasi-steady evolution of FFCs is analytically determined. The model also allows us to express the convolution term of spatial wave number as a concise form, which corresponds to useful information on analyses for the non-linear feedback from small-scale flavor conversions to large-scale ones. Our model yields excellent agreement with numerical simulations, which lends support to our interpretation.         |

|| T.-N. Li, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-14*|

|**Abstract**|            New insights from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data, in conjunction with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) data, suggest that dark energy may not be a cosmological constant. In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of holographic dark energy (HDE) and interacting holographic dark energy (IHDE) models, utilizing CMB, DESI BAO, and SN data. By considering the combined DESI BAO and SN data, we determine that in the IHDE model, the parameter $c > 1$ and the dark-energy equation of state $w$ does not cross $-1$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level, whereas in the HDE model, it marginally falls below this threshold. Upon incorporating CMB data, we observe that in the HDE model, the parameter $c < 1$ and $w$ crosses $-1$ at a level beyond $10\sigma$. Conversely, for the IHDE model, the likelihood of $w$ crossing $-1$ is considerably diminished, implying that the introduction of interaction within the HDE model could potentially resolve or mitigate the cosmic big rip conundrum. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the HDE and IHDE models are statistically as viable as the $\Lambda$CDM model when assessing Bayesian evidence with DESI BAO data combined with SN data. However, when CMB data are added, the HDE and IHDE models are significantly less favored compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our findings advocate for further exploration of the HDE and IHDE models using forthcoming, more precise late-universe observations.         |

|| X. Zhao, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-14*|
|*Comments*| *17 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in APJ*|
|**Abstract**|            We report the discovery of a close binary J0606+2132 (Gaia DR3 3423365496448406272) with $P_{\rm obs}=2.77$ days containing a possible massive white dwarf or a neutron star using the LAMOST spectroscopic data. By a joint fitting of the radial velocity from LAMOST and the light curve from TESS, we derived a circular Keplerian orbit with an inclination of $i=$81.31$^{\circ}$$^{+6.26^{\circ}}_{-7.85^{\circ}}$, which is consistent with that derived from $v{\rm sin}I$. Together with the mass of the visible star, we derived the mass of the invisible object to be 1.34$^{+0.35}_{-0.40} M_{\odot}$. Spectral disentangling with the LAMOST medium-resolution spectra shows no absorption feature from an additional component, suggesting the presence of a compact object. No X-ray or radio pulsed signal is detected from ROSAT and FAST archive observations. J0606+2132 could evolve into either a Type Ia supernova or a neutron star through accretion-induced collapse if it is a white dwarf, or into an intermediate-mass X-ray binary if it is a neutron star.         |
