|**Abstract**| We present deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/MIRI F560W observations of a flux-limited, ALMA-selected sample of 28 galaxies at z=0.5-3.6 in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). The data from the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) reveal the stellar structure of the HUDF galaxies at rest-wavelengths of >1 micron for the first time. We revise the stellar mass estimates using new JWST photometry and find good agreement with pre-JWST analysis; the few discrepancies can be explained by blending issues in the earlier lower-resolution Spitzer data. At z~2.5, the resolved rest-frame near-infrared (1.6 micron) structure of the galaxies is significantly more smooth and centrally concentrated than seen by HST at rest-frame 450 nm (F160W), with effective radii of Re(F560W)=1-5 kpc and S\'ersic indices mostly close to an exponential (disk-like) profile (n~1), up to n~5 (excluding AGN). We find an average size ratio of Re(F560W)/Re(F160W)~0.7 that decreases with stellar mass. The stellar structure of the ALMA-selected galaxies is indistinguishable from a HUDF reference sample of galaxies with comparable MIRI flux density. We supplement our analysis with custom-made, position-dependent, empirical PSF models for the F560W observations. The results imply that an older and smoother stellar structure is in place in massive gas-rich, star-forming galaxies at Cosmic Noon, despite a more clumpy rest-frame optical appearance, placing additional constraints on galaxy formation simulations. As a next step, matched-resolution, resolved ALMA observations will be crucial to further link the mass- and light-weighted galaxy structures to the dusty interstellar medium. |

|**Abstract**| Boxy/peanut (b/p) bulges, the vertically extended inner part of a bar, are ubiquitous in barred disc galaxies in the local Universe, including our own Milky Way. A majority of external galaxies and the Milky Way also possess a thick-disc. However, the dynamical effect of thick-discs in the b/p formation and evolution is not fully understood. Here, we investigate the effect of thick-discs in the formation and evolution of b/p by using a suite of $N$-body models of (kinematically cold) thin and (kinematically hot) thick discs. Within the suite of models, we systematically vary the mass fraction of the thick disc, and the thin-to-thick disc scale length ratio. This allows one to examine the b/p formation in discs with different ratios of cold and hot disc components. The b/ps form in almost all our models via a vertical buckling instability, even in the presence of a massive thick disc. The thin disc b/p is much stronger than the thick disc b/p. With increasing thick disc mass fraction, the final b/p structure gets progressively weaker in strength and larger in extent. Furthermore, the time-interval between the bar formation and the onset of buckling instability gets progressively shorter with increasing thick-disc mass fraction. These trends remain true for all three geometric configurations considered here. The breaking and restoration of the vertical symmetry (during and after the b/p formation) show a spatial variation -- the inner bar region restores vertical symmetry rather quickly (after the buckling) while in the outer bar region, the vertical asymmetry persists long after the buckling happens. Our findings also predict that at higher redshifts, when discs are thought to be thicker, b/ps would have more `boxy-shaped' appearance than more `X-shaped' appearance. This remains to be tested from future observations at higher redshifts. |
