|**Abstract**|            The molecular gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) of star-forming galaxy populations exhibits diverse physical properties. We investigate the $^{12}$CO excitation of twelve dusty, luminous star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 2-4$ by combining observations of the $^{12}$CO from $J_{\rm up} = 1$ to $J_{\rm up} = 8$. The spectral line energy distribution (SLED) has a similar shape to NGC 253, M82, and local ULIRGs, with much stronger excitation than the Milky Way inner disc. By combining with resolved dust continuum sizes from high-resolution $870$-$\mu$m ALMA observations and dust mass measurements determined from multi-wavelength SED fitting, we measure the relationship between the $^{12}$CO SLED and probable physical drivers of excitation: star-formation efficiency, the average intensity of the radiation field $\langle U\rangle$, and the star-formation rate surface density. The primary driver of high-$J_{\rm up}$ $^{12}$CO excitation in star-forming galaxies is star-formation rate surface density. We use the ratio of the CO($3-2$) and CO($6-5$) line fluxes to infer the CO excitation in each source and find that the average ratios for our sample are elevated compared to observations of low-redshift, less actively star-forming galaxies and agree well with predictions from numerical models that relate the ISM excitation to the star-formation rate surface density. The significant scatter in the line ratios of a factor $\approx 3$ within our sample likely reflects intrinsic variations in the ISM properties which may be caused by other effects on the excitation of the molecular gas, such as cosmic ray ionization rates and mechanical heating through turbulence dissipation.         |

|**Abstract**|            $H_0$ tension in the spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM model is reevaluated by employing three sets of non-Planck CMB data, namely WMAP, WMAP+ACT, and WMAP+SPT, in conjunction with DESI BAO data and non-DESI BAO datasets including 6dFGS, SDSS DR7, and SDSS DR16. Our analysis yields $H_0 = 68.86\pm 0.68~\mathrm{km\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ with WMAP+DESI BAO, $H_0 = 68.72\pm 0.51~\mathrm{km\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ with WMAP+ACT+DESI BAO, and $H_0 = 68.62\pm 0.52~\mathrm{km\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ with WMAP+SPT+DESI BAO. The results of non-Planck CMB+DESI BAO exhibit a $3.4\sigma$, $3.7\sigma$, and $3.8\sigma$ tension with the SH0ES local measurement respectively which are around $1 \sigma$ lower in significance for the Hubble tension compared to Planck CMB+DESI BAO. Moreover, by combining DESI BAO data+non-Planck CMB measurements, we obtain a more stringent constraint on the Hubble constant compared to non-DESI BAO data+non-Planck CMB data, as well as reducing the significance of the Hubble tension.         |

|| M. Dehghanian, et al. -- incl., <mark>M. Sharma</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-11-22*|

|**Abstract**|            Context. Quasar outflows are key players in the feedback processes that influence the evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium. The chemical abundance of these outflows provides crucial insights into their origin and impact. Aims. To determine the absolute abundances of nitrogen and sulfur and the physical conditions of the outflow seen in quasar 3C298. Methods. We analyze archival spectral data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for 3C298. We measure Ionic column densities from the absorption troughs and compare the results to photoionization predictions made by the Cloudy code for three different spectral energy distributions (SED), including MF87, UVsoft, and HE0238 SEDs. We also calculate the ionic column densities of excited and ground states of N iii to estimate the electron number density and location of the outflow using the Chianti atomic database. Results. The MF87, UVsoft, and HE0238 SEDs yield nitrogen and sulfur abundances at super-solar, solar, and sub-solar values, respectively, with a spread of 0.4 to 3 times solar. Additionally, we determined an electron number density of log(ne) greater than 3.3 cm-3, with the outflow possibly extending up to a maximum distance of 2.8 kpc. Conclusions. Our results indicate solar metallicity within a 60 percent uncertainty range, driven by variations in the chosen SED and photoionization models. This study underscores the importance of SEDs impact on determining chemical abundances in quasars outflows. These findings highlight the necessity of considering a wider range of possible abundances, spanning from sub solar to super solar values.         |
