|**Abstract**| With the remarkable sensitivity and resolution of JWST in the infrared, measuring rest-optical kinematics of galaxies at $z>5$ has become possible for the first time. This study pilots a new method for measuring galaxy dynamics for highly multiplexed, unbiased samples by combining FRESCO NIRCam grism spectroscopy and JADES medium-band imaging. Here we present one of the first JWST kinematic measurements for a galaxy at $z>5$. We find a significant velocity gradient, which, if interpreted as rotation yields $V_{rot} = 240\pm50$km/s and we hence refer to this galaxy as Twister-z5. With a rest-frame optical effective radius of $r_e=2.25$kpc, the high rotation velocity in this galaxy is not due to a compact size as may be expected in the early universe but rather a high total mass, ${\rm log(M}_{dyn}/{\rm M}_\odot)=11.0\pm0.2$. This is a factor of roughly 4x higher than the stellar mass within the effective radius. We also observe that the radial H$\alpha$ equivalent width profile and the specific star formation rate map from resolved stellar population modeling is centrally depressed by a factor of $\sim1.5$ from the center to $r_e$. Combined with the morphology of the line-emitting gas in comparison to the continuum, this centrally suppressed star formation is consistent with a star-forming disk surrounding a bulge growing inside-out. While large, rapidly rotating disks are common to z~2, the existence of one after only 1Gyr of cosmic time, shown for the first time in ionized gas, adds to the growing evidence that some galaxies matured earlier than expected in the history of the universe. |

|**Abstract**| Protoplanetary disks exhibit a vertical gradient in angular momentum, rendering them susceptible to the Vertical Shear Instability (VSI). The most important condition for the onset of this mechanism is a short timescale of thermal relaxation ($\lesssim 0.1$ orbital timescales). Simulations of fully VSI active disks are characterized by turbulent, vertically extended dust layers. This is in contradiction with recent observations of the outer regions of some protoplanetary disks, which appear highly settled. In this work, we demonstrate that the process of dust coagulation can diminish the cooling rate of the gas in the outer disk and extinct the VSI activity. Our findings indicate that the turbulence strength is especially susceptible to variations in the fragmentation velocity of the grains. A small fragmentation velocity of $\approx 100 \mathrm{\, cm \,s^{-1}}$ results in a fully turbulent simulation, whereas a value of $\approx 400 \mathrm{\, cm \,s^{-1}}$ results in a laminar outer disk, being consistent with observations. We show that VSI turbulence remains relatively unaffected by variations in the maximum particle size in the inner disk regions. However, we find that dust coagulation can significantly suppress the occurrence of VSI turbulence at larger distances from the central star. |

|| J. Brande, et al. -- incl., <mark>L. Kreidberg</mark>, <mark>T. Mikal-Evans</mark> |

|**Abstract**| Over the last decade, precise exoplanet transmission spectroscopy has revealed the atmospheres of dozens of exoplanets, driven largely by observatories like the \textit{Hubble} Space Telescope. One major discovery has been the ubiquity of atmospheric aerosols, often blocking access to exoplanet chemical inventories. Tentative trends have been identified, showing that the clarity of planetary atmospheres may depend on equilibrium temperature. Previous work has often grouped dissimilar planets together in order to increase the statistical power of any trends, but it remains unclear from observed transmission spectra whether these planets exhibit the same atmospheric physics and chemistry. We present a re-analysis of a smaller, more physically similar sample of 15 exo-Neptune transmission spectra across a wide range of temperatures (200-1000 K). Using condensation cloud and hydrocarbon haze models, we find that the exo-Neptune population is best described by very low cloud sedimentation efficiency ($\mathrm{f_{sed}}\sim0.01$) and high metallicity ($100\times$ Solar). There is an intrinsic astrophysical scatter of $\sim0.5$ scale height, perhaps evidence of stochasticity in these planets' formation processes. Observers should expect significant attenuation in transmission spectra of Neptune-size exoplanets, up to 6 scale heights for equilibrium temperatures between 500 and 800~K. With JWST's greater wavelength sensitivity, colder ($<500$~K) planets should be high-priority targets given their comparative rarity, clearer atmospheres, and the need to distinguish between the ``super-puffs'' and more typical gas-dominated planets. |

|**Abstract**| We investigate the steady spherically symmetric accretion in the combined potential of a central black hole and a dark matter halo. For the halo, we consider a Hernquist and an NFW potential and calculate the critical points of the flow. We find that the trans-sonic solution to the centre is not possible without a black hole, whereas two types of trans-sonic solutions are possible in its presence. We also derive the mass accretion rate for a black hole at the centre of a dark matter halo. Our results indicate two phases of accretion. The first is an initial phase with a low accretion rate that depends on the black hole mass, followed by a second phase with a high accretion rate that depends on the halo mass. In the second phase, the black hole mass increases rapidly to supermassive scales, which explains the existence of quasars at redshift $z\ge 6$ and also the recently detected supermassive black hole (SMBH) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Further, we calculate the evolution of the Eddington ratio for growing black holes. The accretion is mostly sub-Eddington except for a short super-Eddington episode when the mass accretion rate transitions from low to high. However, during that episode, the black hole mass is likely inadequate to hinder accretion through radiative feedback. |

|**Abstract**| The cosmic microwave background (CMB) provides an important source for the study of weak gravitational lensing. The lensed CMB can be used to constrain cosmological parameters, but it also has smoothing effect on the original CMB. The angular power spectrum of the unlensed CMB has sharper acoustic peaks and more prominent damping tails, allowing for improved inferences of cosmological parameters affecting these characteristics. Although delensing reduces the B-mode power spectrum, it aids the search for primordial gravitational waves and allows for lower variance reconstruction of lensing and other sources of secondary CMB anisotropies. In this work, we investigate whether the deep learning methods, concretely the U-Net++ algorithm here, can play a crucial role in CMB delensing. We consider three fields, i.e., T, Q and U sky maps, present the angular power spectra of CMB delensed TT, EE and BB, and compare them with the unlensed CMB angular power spectra. The results show that the angular power spectrum of the lensed CMB processed by U-Net++ is in great agreement with the unlensed CMB angular power spectrum. Therefore, the U-Net++ based CMB delensing can efficiently eliminate the effects caused by weak gravitational lensing and shed new light on the CMB power spectrum for future CMB experiments. |

|| N. Wang, et al. -- incl., <mark>K. Lee</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-10-12*|
|*Comments*| *12 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in Science China Physics, Mechanics & Astronomy*|
|**Abstract**| This study presents a general outline of the Qitai radio telescope (QTT) project. Qitai, the site of the telescope, is a county of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China, located in the east Tianshan Mountains at an elevation of about 1800 m. The QTT is a fully steerable, Gregorian type telescope with a standard parabolic main reflector of 110 m diameter. The QTT has adopted an um-brella support, homology-symmetric lightweight design. The main reflector is active so that the deformation caused by gravity can be corrected. The structural design aims to ultimately allow high-sensitivity observations from 150 MHz up to 115 GHz. To satisfy the requirements for early scientific goals, the QTT will be equipped with ultra-wideband receivers and large field-of-view mul-ti-beam receivers. A multi-function signal-processing system based on RFSoC and GPU processor chips will be developed. These will enable the QTT to operate in pulsar, spectral line, continuum and Very Long Baseline Interferometer (VLBI) observing modes. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and radio frequency interference (RFI) control techniques are adopted throughout the system design. The QTT will form a world-class observational platform for the detection of low-frequency (nanoHertz) gravitational waves through pulsar timing array (PTA) techniques, pulsar surveys, the discovery of binary black-hole systems, and exploring dark matter and the origin of life in the universe. |
