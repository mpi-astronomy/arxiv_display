|**Abstract**|            Spatially resolved stellar populations of massive, quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon provide powerful insights into star-formation quenching and stellar mass assembly mechanisms. Previous photometric work has revealed that the cores of these galaxies are redder than their outskirts. However, spectroscopy is needed to break the age-metallicity degeneracy and uncover the driver of these colour gradients. Here, we derive age and elemental abundance gradients for 8 distant ($1.2 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.2$), massive ($10.3\lesssim\log({\rm M}_*/{\rm M}_\odot)\lesssim 11.1$), quiescent galaxies, by fitting full-spectrum models to ultra-deep NIRSpec-MSA spectroscopy from the JWST-SUSPENSE survey. We find that these galaxies have negative age, positive [Mg/H] and [Mg/Fe], and flat [Fe/H] gradients, implying that galaxy cores are older and Mg-deficient compared to galaxy outskirts. The age gradients indicate inside-out quenching, while the Mg-deficient cores suggest rapid gas expulsion as the central quenching mechanism. Thus, galaxy cores formed faster and quenched more efficiently than their outskirts. In this scenario, however, our [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] gradients are still puzzling. Our results contrast lower-redshift studies, which find flat age and [Mg/Fe] gradients and negative metallicity gradients. Additionally, we find a positive trend between age gradients and rotational support, and marginal trends between gradients and galaxy velocity dispersions and ages. We discuss our findings in the context of galaxy growth scenarios, including minor mergers and progenitor bias, and the possible occurrence of different quenching mechanisms across redshift. With this work, we present the first stellar population gradients from NIRSpec-MSA spectroscopy, in the largest current sample of distant, quiescent galaxies.         |

|**Abstract**|            Hot Jupiters and their atmospheres are prime targets for transmission spectroscopy due to their extended atmospheres and the corresponding large signal-to-noise, providing the best possible constraints for the atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio and metallicity of exoplanets. Within BOWIE-ALIGN, we aim to compare JWST spectra of a sample of orbitally aligned and misaligned hot Jupiters orbiting F-type stars to probe the link between hot Jupiter atmospheres and planet formation history. Here, we present a near-infrared transmission spectrum of the aligned planet KELT-7b using one transit observed with JWST NIRSpec/G395H. We find weak features, only tentative evidence for H$_2$O and CO$_2$ in the atmosphere of KELT-7b. This poses a challenge to constrain the atmospheric properties of KELT-7b and two possible scenarios emerge from equilibrium chemistry and free chemistry retrievals: a high-altitude cloud deck muting all features or an extremely low metallicity atmosphere, respectively. The retrieved C/O ratios from our data reductions range from $0.43 - 0.74$, while the atmospheric metallicity is suggested to be solar to super-solar ($1-16 \times$ solar). Although these wide constraints prevent detailed conclusions about KELT-7b's formation history, a solar-to-super-solar metallicity would imply the accretion of solid material during its formation, which is valuable information for the survey's wider goals of understanding the relative importance of gaseous to solid accretion.         |

|| H. Sana, et al. -- incl., <mark>S. Shahaf</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-09-17*|
|*Comments*| *32 pages, 12 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            At high metallicity, a majority of massive stars have at least one close stellar companion. The evolution of such binaries is subject to strong interaction processes, heavily impacting the characteristics of their life-ending supernova and compact remnants. For the low-metallicity environments of high-redshift galaxies constraints on the multiplicity properties of massive stars over the separation range leading to binary interaction are crucially missing. Here we show that the presence of massive stars in close binaries is ubiquitous, even at low metallicity. Using the Very Large Telescope, we obtained multi-epoch radial velocity measurements of a representative sample of 139 massive O-type stars across the Small Magellanic Cloud, which has a metal content of about one fifth of the solar value. We find that 45% of them show radial velocity variations which demonstrate that they are members of close binary systems, and predominantly have orbital periods shorter than one year. Correcting for observational biases indicates that at least 70[+11:-6]% of the O stars in our sample are in close binaries, and that at least 68[+7:-8]% of all O stars interact with a companion star during their lifetime. We found no evidence supporting a statistically significant trend of the multiplicity properties with metallicity. Our results indicate that multiplicity and binary interactions govern the evolution of massive stars and determine their cosmic feedback and explosive fates.         |

|**Abstract**|            Local Universe dwarf galaxies are both cosmological and mass assembly probes. Deep surveys have enabled the study of these objects down to the low surface brightness (LSB) regime. In this paper, we estimate Euclid's dwarf detection capabilities as well as limits of its MERge processing function (MER pipeline), responsible for producing the stacked mosaics and final catalogues. To do this, we inject mock dwarf galaxies in a real Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) field in the VIS band and compare the input catalogue to the final MER catalogue. The mock dwarf galaxies are generated with simple Sérsic models and structural parameters extracted from observed dwarf galaxy property catalogues. To characterize the detected dwarfs, we use the mean surface brightness inside the effective radius SBe (in mag arcsec-2). The final MER catalogues achieve completenesses of 91 % for SBe in [21, 24], and 54 % for SBe in [24, 28]. These numbers do not take into account possible contaminants, including confusion with background galaxies at the location of the dwarfs. After taking into account those effects, they become respectively 86 % and 38 %. The MER pipeline performs a final local background subtraction with small mesh size, leading to a flux loss for galaxies with Re > 10". By using the final MER mosaics and reinjecting this local background, we obtain an image in which we recover reliable photometric properties for objects under the arcminute scale. This background-reinjected product is thus suitable for the study of Local Universe dwarf galaxies. Euclid's data reduction pipeline serves as a test bed for other deep surveys, particularly regarding background subtraction methods, a key issue in LSB science.         |

|**Abstract**|            SN 2024aecx is a nearby ($\sim$11 Mpc) Type IIb SN discovered within $\sim$1 d after explosion. In this paper we report high-cadence photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations, conducted from as early as 0.27 d post discovery out to the nebular phase at 158.4 d. We analyze the environment of SN 2024aecx and derive a new distance, metallicity and host extinction. The light curve exhibits a hot and luminous shock-cooling peak at the first few days, followed by a main peak with very rapid post-maximum decline. The earliest spectra are blue and featureless, while from 2.3 d after discovery prominent P-Cygni profiles emerge. At nebular phase, the emission lines exhibit asymmetric and double-peaked profiles, indicating asphericity and/or early dust formation in the ejecta. We simulated the progenitor and explosion using a two-component model of shock cooling and radioactive $^{56}$Ni heating; our model favors an extended, low-mass H-rich envelope with$ M_{\mathrm{e}} = 0.08^{+0.02}_{-0.03}\, M_{\odot} $ and a low ejecta mass of $ M_{\mathrm{ej}} = 2.65^{+1.21}_{-0.73} \, M_{\odot}. $The comprehensive monitoring of SN 2024aecx, coupled with the detailed characterization of its local environment, establishes it as a benchmark event for probing the progenitors and explosion mechanisms of Type IIb SNe.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2025-09-17*|
|*Comments*| *ApJ in press, 17 pages, 5 figures; DOI: https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/adfed2*|
|**Abstract**|            We present a systematic analysis on the X-ray variability in 13 bright quasars at z > 4.5, combining recent Swift observations from 2021 to 2023 and archival multi-epoch observations. Upper limits of the luminosity measurements were included in the analysis by using the Kaplan-Meier estimator method. It is found that the high-z quasars exhibit X-ray variability on both short-term (hours-to-days) and intermediate-term (weeks-to-months) timescales, with short-term variability dominating the overall variation. A linear correlation exists between the global mean ($\mu_{\mathrm{L_{2-10\,keV}}}$) and standard deviation ($\sigma_{\mathrm{L_{2-10\,keV}}}$) of X-ray luminosities, which is independent of the X-ray photon index and optical-to-X-ray spectral slope. The localized stochastic magnetic reconnection mechanism is strongly favored, which can naturally lead to a scale-invariant power-law energy distribution and satisfactorily explain the correlation. The $\sigma$-$\mu$ correlation parallels with the well-documented rms-flux relation of low-z active galactic nuclei (AGNs), implying the magnetic reconnection mechanism could drive short-timescale X-ray variability in both high- and low-z AGNs. The highest-z quasar in our sample, J142952+544717 (z = 6.18), shows a luminosity distribution extending to ${10}^{47}\ \rm{erg\ {s}^{-1}}$ with a not conspicuous median luminosity. On the other hand, J143023+420436 (z = 4.7), which hosts the most relativistic jet among known high-z blazars, is dominated in the high-luminosity regime (${10}^{47}\ \rm{erg\ {s}^{-1}}$ ), making it an ideal target for multi-wavelength follow-up observations. J090630+693030 is found to have a rest-frame period of 182.46 days and J143023+420436 has a period of 16.89 days, both could be explained by the global evolution of plasmoid chains, in which magnetic islands formed during reconnection may merge successively.         |

|**Abstract**|            The vertical distribution of pebbles in protoplanetary disks is a fundamental property influencing planet formation, from dust aggregation to the assembly of planetary cores. In the outer region of protoplanetary disks, the intensity of the optically thin but geometrically thick dust ring decreases along the minor axis due to reduced line-of-sight optical depth. Multi-ring disks thus provide an excellent opportunity to study the radial variation of the vertical properties of dust. We investigate the vertical dust distribution in 6 protoplanetary disks with resolved double rings, using high-resolution ALMA Band 6 continuum observations. By modeling the azimuthal intensity variations in these rings, we constrain the dust scale heights for each ring. Our results reveal a dichotomy: inner rings exhibit puffed-up dust layers with heights comparable to the gas scale height, while outer rings are significantly more settled, with dust scale heights less than 20\% of the gas scale height. This suggests a radial dependence in dust settling efficiency within the disks, potentially driven by localized planetary interactions or the global radial dependence of the Vertical Shear Instability (VSI). We discuss the implications of these findings for dust trapping, planet formation, and protoplanetary disk evolution. Our work highlights the importance of vertical dust distribution in understanding the early stages of planet formation and suggests that outer ($>80$~au), settled rings are preferred sites for planet formation over inner ($<80$~au), turbulent rings.         |

|**Abstract**|            The performance of future observatories such as the Extremely Large Telescope is mainly limited by atmospheric turbulence and structural vibrations of the optical assembly. To further enhance the mitigation performance of adaptive optics, real-time information about the disturbances acting on the control loop is needed. Current systems therefore employ a combination of wavefront sensor- and accelerometer-based filters. In this work, methods using only data from natural- and laser guide star (NGS, LGS) measurements are presented, as telescopes like the Very Large Telescope already have multiple fast and high-resolution wavefront sensors installed. This approach also avoids the costly installation and operation of additional accelerometers on the optical elements. We introduce two innovative disturbance observer schemes to sense both turbulence and vibration information. A multi-rate estimator for atmospheric influences is based on Kalman filter theory and can incorporate NGS and LGS signals at different loop rates. The estimator for structural perturbations uses Gaussian process regression and can be implemented in an offline and online configuration. We validate the filter designs with data from a realistic end-to-end adaptive optics model with randomly generated turbulence and vibrations. The simulation is fed with on-sky data from the Adaptive Optics Facility of the Very Large Telescope. The presented disturbance observer schemes demonstrate promising results and may be considered as potential alternatives or extensions to existing techniques such as linear-quadratic controllers with Kalman filtering (LQG).         |

|**Abstract**|            Recent advances in ground-based astronomy have made it possible to create optical telescopes with primary mirrors up to 40 m in size. With growing mirror diameter, the suppression of non-atmospheric disturbances becomes increasingly important. Precise knowledge of the movement of telescope mirrors is essential for understanding and compensating for vibration-based perturbations. A model from VLT accelerometer data for each individual mirror is developed, while the influence of wind buffeting is accounted for by a von Karman wind model. To describe the relevant rigid body motion, we consider the piston, tip and tilt modes of the mirrors. The identification is validated by comparing the power spectral density of the measured and identified modes. Additionally, we assess the robustness of the approach by calculating the identification error over different sections of the data. The study indicates that the employed methods are adequate for the identification of modal telescope vibrations. It is anticipated that said findings will serve as a significant foundation for the development of advanced model-based AO controllers for large telescopes, such as linear quadratic Gaussian control.         |

|**Abstract**|            Large-scale research infrastructures (LSRIs) are central to contemporary science policy, combining massive capital investments with international access regimes. Yet whether open access to these infrastructures translates into more equitable scientific authority remains contested. Astronomy provides a critical case: world-leading observatories are globally shared but embedded in specific national contexts. We compile a novel country--year dataset (1955--2025) linking the location of astronomical facilities with publication usage and authorship roles. This enables us to distinguish between hosting, using, and leading in telescope-based research. Our analysis reveals: (i) usage and impact are heavily concentrated in a small number of facility hubs; (ii) scientific leadership is even more unequal than access or usage (Gini coefficient 0.91 for first/corresponding authorship versus 0.85 for facilities and usage); (iii) hosting and leadership often decouple--countries such as Chile and South Africa mediate large publication volumes without commensurate gains in leading roles; and (iv) global leadership has shifted from U.S. dominance to a multi-hub system centered in the United States, Western Europe, China, Japan, and Australia. These findings challenge the assumption that international access alone democratizes science. We argue that converting participation into leadership requires domestic PI programs, investments in instrumentation and data pipelines, and governance models that distribute credit more equitably. The study highlights how the governance of LSRIs shapes global scientific hierarchies and offers design principles for infrastructures that seek not only to share data but also to broaden scientific authority.         |
