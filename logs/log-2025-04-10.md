|**Abstract**|            The presence of a 'butterfly' or a quadrupole structure in the stellar mean radial velocity field of the Milky Way is well known from the Gaia and the APOGEE surveys. Past studies indicated that a stellar bar can excite such a quadrupole feature in the $<V_R>$ distribution. However, a systematic study investigating the co-evolution of bar and quadrupole structure is largely missing. Furthermore, whether this quadrupole structure in $<V_R>$ can be used as a robust kinematic diagnostic to constrain bar properties, particularly for the Milky Way, is still beyond our grasp. Here, we investigate the bar-induced quadrupole feature using a suite of isolated N-body models forming prominent bars and a sample of Milky Way-like barred galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. We demonstrate that the properties of the quadrupole (strength, length, and orientation) are strongly correlated with the bar properties, regardless of the choice of the stellar tracer population; thereby making the quadrupole feature an excellent kinematic diagnostic for constraining the bar properties. In presence of spirals, the estimator which takes into account the phase-angle of m=4 Fourier moment, serves as a more appropriate estimator for measuring the length of the quadrupole. Further, we constructed a novel Gaia-like mock dataset from a simulated bar model while incorporating the dust extinction and the broad trends of observational errors of the Gaia survey. The quadrupole properties (strength and length) estimated from those Gaia-like mock data are larger (~35-45 percent) when compared with their true values. We determined that the majority of this effect is due to the uncertainty in parallax measurement. This demonstrates the potential caveat of inferring Milky Way's bar properties by using the stellar kinematic information from the Gaia DR3 without properly accounting for the observational uncertainties.         |

|**Abstract**|            We identified a new post-interaction binary, HIP 15429, consisting of a stripped star and a recently formed, rapidly rotating Be star companion ($v \sin i \approx 270$ km/s) sharing many similarities with recently identified bloated stripped stars. From orbital fitting of multi-epoch radial velocities we find a 221-day period. We also find an eccentricity of $e=0.52$, which is unexpectedly high as tides are expected to have circularised the orbit efficiently during the presumed recent mass transfer. The formation of a circumbinary disk during the mass transfer phase or the presence of an unseen tertiary companion might explain the orbit's high eccentricity. We determined physical parameters for both stars by fitting the spectra of the disentangled binary components and multi-band photometry. The stripped nature of the donor star is affirmed by its high luminosity at a low inferred mass ($\lesssim 1 \mathrm{M}_\odot$) and imprints of CNO-processed material in the surface abundances. The donor's relatively large radius and cool temperature ($T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 13.5 \pm 0.5$ kK) suggest that it has only recently ceased mass transfer. Evolutionary models assuming a 5-6 $\mathrm{M}_\odot$ progenitor can reproduce these parameters and imply that the binary is currently evolving towards a stage where the donor becomes a subdwarf orbiting a Be star. The remarkably high eccentricity of HIP 15429 challenges standard tidal evolution models, suggesting either inefficient tidal dissipation or external influences, such as a tertiary companion or circumbinary disk. This underscores the need to identify and characterise more post-mass transfer binaries to benchmark and refine theoretical models of binary evolution.         |

|**Abstract**|            Galaxy surveys are crucial for studying large-scale structure (LSS) and cosmology, yet they face limitations--imaging surveys provide extensive sky coverage but suffer from photo-$z$ uncertainties, while spectroscopic surveys yield precise redshifts but are sample-limited. To take advantage of both photo-$z$ and spec-$z$ data while eliminating photo-$z$ errors, we propose a deep learning framework based on a dual UNet architecture that integrates these two datasets at the field level to reconstruct the 3D photo-$z$ density field. We train the network on mock samples representative of stage-IV spectroscopic surveys, utilizing CosmicGrowth simulations with a $z=0.59$ snapshot containing $2048^3$ particles in a $(1200~h^{-1}\rm Mpc)^3$ volume. Several metrics, including correlation coefficient, MAE, MSE, PSNR, and SSIM, validate the model's accuracy. Moreover, the reconstructed power spectrum closely matches the ground truth at small scales ($k \gtrsim 0.06~h/\rm Mpc$) within the $1\sigma$ confidence level, while the UNet model significantly improves the estimation of photo-$z$ power spectrum multipoles. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning to enhance LSS reconstruction by using both spectroscopic and photometric data.         |

|**Abstract**|            We preform a systematic search for galactic-scale quasar pairs and small-scale (<3 arcsec) lenses using the SDSS DR16 quasar catalog and Gaia DR3. Candidate double quasars (both are unobscured) are identified as Gaia resolved pairs around spectroscopically confirmed SDSS quasars ($L_{\rm bol} > 10^{44.5} \ {\rm erg \ s^{-1}}$) at $0.5 < z \lesssim 4.5$. Gaia astrometric information and SDSS spectral decomposition are used to exclude foreground star superpositions, which dominate ($\gtrsim 80\%$ of) the pair sample. We identify $136$ double quasar candidates from $1120$ Gaia-resolved pairs after a magnitude and redshift cut of $G<20.5$ and $z>0.5$ (803 double quasars out of 2,497 pairs without any cuts applied) with separations of $\sim$ 0.3 - 3 arcsec, corresponding to projected physical separations of $\sim$ 3 - 30 kpc at the median redshift of the sample of $z = 1.7$. We estimate an overall double quasar (lens and physical pairs combined) fraction using this sample, corrected for pair-resolving completeness, of $5.7_{-0.3}^{+0.3} \times 10^{-4}$ (bootstrapping errors). This double quasar fraction increases toward smaller separations, consistent with earlier findings. We also find little redshift evolution of the double quasar fraction for the luminous SDSS sample, consistent with previous observations and simulation predictions. However, the observed fraction is lower than simulation predictions by $\sim$0.8 - 1.6 dex, suggesting a significant population of obscured quasar pairs are missed in our search. Future wide-area space missions targeting both unobscured and obscured quasar pairs at sub-arcsec resolutions will reveal this population of obscured quasar pairs, and extend to much lower AGN luminosities.         |

|**Abstract**|            As an interesting subclass of gamma-ray burst (GRB), Type IL GRB (such as GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A) features a long-duration prompt emission but originating from compact binary merger. The "long duration" emisison of Type IL GRB are dominately composed of the main burst, rather than the extended emission, differentiating them from the traditional "long-short" GRB (e.g., GRB 060614). Previous study has reported several Type IL GRBs by visual inspection of their light curves. In this work, we established a detailed criterion to identify Type IL GRBs by light curve, and then systematically searched the archival \textit{Fermi}/GBM data with this criterion, resulting in a sample of 5 type IL GRBs from January 1, 2014 to January 1, 2024, i.e. GRB 230307A, GRB 211211A, GRB 200914A, GRB 200311A and GRB 170228A. Apart from the light curve pattern, we find that the temporal and spectral properties of these 5 GRBs also support this classification. Interestingly, we find that the energy ratio between extended emission and main emission is almost constant ($\sim0.7$, with small scattering) for these GRBs, which have strong implication on the mechanism of Type IL burst. We discuss theoretical models to interpret the progenitor, central engine, and extended emission of these Type IL bursts.         |

|**Abstract**|            Detection of spectral line in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is importance for studying GRB physics, as it provides insights into the composition and physical conditions of the GRB environment. However, progress in detecting X-ray or gamma-ray emission and absorption lines in GRB spectra has been relatively slow, only the narrow emission line feature of about 10 MeV found in GRB 221009A has exhibited a significance exceeding $5 \sigma$. Here, we report the probable evidence of a narrow emission feature at about 2.1 mega-electron volts (MeV) in the spectrum of GRB 221023A. The highest statistical significance of this feature is observed in the time interval between 8 and 30 seconds after Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor trigger, with the chance probability value $<2.56 \times 10^{-5}$ (after accounting for the look-elsewhere effect), corresponding to a Gaussian-equivalent significance $> 4.20 \sigma$. We interpret this feature as being generated through the de-excitation of excited electrons in the relativistic hydrogen-like high-atomic-number ions entrained in the GRB jet.         |
