|**Abstract**|            The Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) survey is an ESO large programme designed to obtain multi-epoch spectroscopy for 929 massive stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). It will provide binary fractions and orbital configurations of binary systems, and search for dormant black-hole binary candidates (OB+BH). Here we present projected rotational velocities (vsini) of all sources and, using the multiplicity properties presented in previous papers, we derive the vsini distributions of apparent single stars, single lined spectroscopic (SB1) binaries, and SB2 systems. We identify a locus in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram where rotational velocities decrease significantly; we interpret this feature as broadly corresponding to the terminal-age main sequence. The main sequence cohort is distinguished by a broad range of vsini values, but with a strong peak in the distribution in the range 30-60 km/s, close to the resolution limit of 30 km/s. Sources in this low vsini peak are distributed throughout the main sequence, and are also present in the SB1 sample, though less prominent than in the single star distribution. A preliminary analysis of the lowest vsini cohort, that includes SB1 systems, implies that roughly one third may be nitrogen rich and we speculate that this cohort is a mix of pristine single stars, long period binaries, and merger products. The SB2 systems appear to be mostly short period binaries in synchronous rotation and have vsini estimates distributed around a mean value of approximately 140 km/s . Higher vsini sources are also present in the single and SB1 systems, all of which have tail to higher vsini values, consistent with tidal and mass-transfer effects. The supergiants, with a few exceptions, have low vsini, the bulk of these systems being essentially unresolved at current spectral resolution.         |

|**Abstract**|            To eliminate gravitational non-Gaussianity, we introduce the $\mathcal{Z}$-$\kappa$ transform, a simple local nonlinear transform of the matter density field that emulates the inverse of nonlinear gravitational evolution. Using $N$-body simulations, we show that the $\mathcal{Z}$-$\kappa$ transform with $\kappa=6$ or $\kappa\to\infty$ (i.e., log) substantially Gaussianizes the density distribution, and recovers the linear power spectrum. In an extended parameter space including primordial non-Gaussianity, summed neutrino mass, and $\Lambda$CDM parameters, Fisher analysis demonstrates that power spectra of transformed fields provide strong complementary constraints. A central result is that these power spectra can directly capture the local primordial non-Gaussianity imprinted in large-scale structure. This opens a new avenue for probing the physics of the early Universe with Stage-IV surveys using two-point statistics.         |

|**Abstract**|            Context. Rotational instability of rubble-pile asteroids can trigger mass shedding, forming transient debris clouds that may provide the initial conditions for secondary formation in binary systems. Aims. We investigate the dynamical and collisional evolution of a debris cloud numerically generated around a Didymos-like progenitor, as a representative case for the early formation of Dimorphos. The analysis focuses on the growth and structural properties of clusters composed of centimetre- to decimetre-scale particles. Methods. We perform full-scale simulations of debris evolution around a near-critically rotating asteroid using a cross-spatial-scale approach combined with the discrete element method (DEM). To overcome computational timescale limitations, an equivalent cluster-scale simulation framework is introduced to capture the essential collisional growth processes efficiently. These simulations quantify the efficiency of cluster growth and the structural evoution within the debris cloud. Results. Our simulations reveal that particles shed from a rotationally unstable asteroid exhibit a consistent migration pattern toward low-geopotential regions, which governs the mass distribution and dynamical structure of the debris cloud. The collisional velocity are well described by a Weibull distribution (lambda = 0.0642, k = 1.8349), where low-velocity impacts favor accretion. These collisions enable clusters to grow from centimeter-decimeter scales to meter-sized bodies, developing compact, moderately porous structures (Delta I \approx 0.8, phi \approx 0.52). Collisions between meter-sized clusters do not exhibit a bouncing barrier: low-velocity impacts yield Dinkinesh-like shapes, while moderate velocities promote plastic merging and continued growth.         |

|| Y. Pan, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            We present a statistical census of bright, star-forming satellite galaxies around Milky Way (MW) analogs using the first data release of the Merian Survey. Our sample consists of 393 MW analogs with stellar masses $10^{10.5} < M_{\star, \rm host} < 10^{10.9} M_\odot$ at redshifts $0.07 < z < 0.09$, all central galaxies of their own dark matter halos. Using photometric selection -- including magnitude, color, angular size, photometric redshift, and size-mass cuts -- we identify 793 satellite candidates around these 393 hosts. Our selection leverages two medium-band filters targeting H$\alpha$ and [O \textsc{iii}] emission, enabling a nearly complete sample of star-forming, Magellanic Clouds-like satellites with $M_{\star, \rm sat} \gtrsim 10^{8} M_\odot$. We find that $\sim80\%$ of hosts have 0-3 massive satellites, and $13\pm4\%$ have two satellites (similar to the MW). Satellite abundance correlates with total stellar mass, and we provide significantly improved statistics for the most massive satellites at $\log_{10}[M_{\star, \rm sat}/M_{\odot}] \gtrsim 10$. The completeness-corrected radial distribution is less centrally concentrated than an NFW profile. In contrast, the Milky Way satellites are more centrally concentrated than the 50\% richest Merian systems, but are broadly consistent with the 50\% most centrally concentrated Merian systems. Our results highlight the power of medium-band photometry for satellite identification and provide a key benchmark for studying satellite quenching, environmental effects, and hierarchical galaxy formation.         |

|**Abstract**|            The interaction between interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME) structures can alter the geo-effectiveness of the ICME events in myriad ways. Many aspects of these interaction processes are not well-understood till date. Using the energy spectra measured in two mutually orthogonal top hat analyzers (THA 1 and 2), which are part of the Solar Wind Ion Spectrometer (SWIS) subsystem of the Aditya Solar Wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) on board India's Aditya L1 mission, we gain insights into intricate features of ICME ICME interactions during May 2024 solar event. We report here an unprecedented two-orthogonal-plane perspective of ICME ICME interactions for the first time from the L1 point. The investigation reveals a special interaction region formed by the propagation of the forward shock driven by complex ejecta in the preceding ICME. The interaction causes the formation of a downstream region spanning over 13 hours, which propagates in the interplanetary medium. The observations reveal that this region serves as a site for proton and alpha particle energization, and the particles within this region get distributed from one plane to the other. The presence of forward shock and particle energization is confirmed by the energetic particle flux measurements by the SupraThermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of ASPEX. These observations provide an unprecedented perspective on how solar wind ions become energized and distributed in an ICME-ICME interaction region.         |

|| J. Zhang, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-12-16*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted to MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**|            The alignment between the radio-based International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) and the optical Gaia Celestial Reference Frame (Gaia-CRF) is critical for multi-waveband astronomy, yet systematic offsets at the optical bright end (G<13) limit their consistency. While radio stars offer a potential link between these frames, their utility has been restricted by the scarcity of precise Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) astrometry. In this study, we present new VLBI astrometry of 11 radio stars using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), expanding the existing sample with positions, parallaxes, and proper motions measured. All 11 radio stars were detected, for 10 of which parallaxes and proper motions can be estimated, reaching a precision level of <1% in the best cases. These new samples greatly contribute to the link between ICRF and Gaia-CRF at the optical bright end.         |

|**Abstract**|            HEL1OS (High Energy L1 Orbiting X-ray Spectrometer) is one of the remote sensing payloads on board Aditya-L1 mission designed to continuously monitor and measure the time-resolved spectra of solar flares between 8 keV and 150 keV. This broad energy range has been covered by using compound semiconductor detectors: cadmium telluride (CdTe: 8 - 70 keV) and cadmium zinc telluride (CZT: 20 - 150 keV) with geometric areas of 0.5 cm$^2$ and 32 cm$^2$, respectively. A stainless steel collimator provides a field-of-view of 6$^\circ$ $\times$ 6$^\circ$ optimized to limit the off-axis response while keeping the design within the instrument mass constraints. The in-house designed low-noise digital pulse processing-based front-end electronics has achieved a spectral resolution of $\approx$ 1 keV at 14 keV (CdTe) and $\approx$ 7 keV at 60 keV (CZT). The instrument is also equipped with processing and power electronics to process the signal, drive the electronics, bias the detectors with required low and high voltages for optimal performance of the overall system. In this article, we present design aspects of the instrument, results from the pre-launch ground-based tests, and the in-orbit operations, which have indicated optimal performance in line with that expected.         |
