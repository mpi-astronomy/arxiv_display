|**Abstract**|            Dense, cold gas is the key ingredient for star formation. Over the last two decades, HCN(1-0) emission has been utilised as the most accessible dense gas tracer to study external galaxies. We present new measurements tracing the relationship between dense gas tracers, bulk molecular gas tracers, and star formation in the ALMA ALMOND survey, the largest sample of resolved (1-2 kpc resolution) HCN maps of galaxies in the local universe (d < 25 Mpc). We measure HCN/CO, a line ratio sensitive to the physical density distribution, and SFR/HCN, a proxy for the dense gas star formation efficiency, as a function of molecular gas surface density, stellar mass surface density, and dynamical equilibrium pressure across 31 galaxies, increasing the number of galaxies by a factor of > 3 over the previous largest such study (EMPIRE). HCN/CO increases (slope of ~ 0.5 and scatter of ~ 0.2 dex), while SFR/HCN decreases (slope of ~ -0.6 and scatter of ~ 0.4 dex) with increasing molecular gas surface density, stellar mass surface density and pressure. Galaxy centres with high stellar mass surface density show a factor of a few higher HCN/CO and lower SFR/HCN compared to the disc average, but both environments follow the same average trend. Our results emphasise that molecular gas properties vary systematically with the galactic environment and demonstrate that the scatter in the Gao-Solomon relation (SFR against HCN) is of physical origin.         |

|**Abstract**|            Planetary bodies are formed by coagulation of solid dust grains in protoplanetary disks. Therefore, it is crucial to constrain the physical and chemical properties of the dust grains. In this study, we measure the dust albedo at mm-wavelength, which depends on dust properties at the disk midplane. Since the albedo and dust temperature are generally degenerate in observed thermal dust emission, it is challenging to determine them simultaneously. We propose to break this degeneracy by using multiple optically-thin molecular lines as a dust-albedo independent thermometer. In practice, we employ pressure-broadened CO line wings that provide an exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio as an optically thin line. We model the CO $J=2-1$ and $3-2$ spectra observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) at the inner region ($r<6\ {\rm au}$) of the TW Hya disk and successfully derived the midplane temperature. Combining multi-band continuum observations, we constrain the albedo spectrum at $0.9-3$ mm for the first time without assuming a dust opacity model. The albedo at these wavelengths is high, $\sim0.5-0.8$, and broadly consistent with the Ricci et al. (2010), DIANA, and DSHARP dust models. Even without assuming dust composition, we estimate the maximum grain size to be $\sim 340\ \mu m$, the power law index of the grain size distribution to be $>-4.1$, and porosity to be $<0.96$. The derived dust size may suggest efficient fragmentation with the threshold velocity of $\sim 0.08\ {\rm m\ s^{-1}}$. We also note that the absolute flux uncertainty of $\sim10\%$ ($1\sigma$) is measured and used in the analysis, which is approximately twice the usually assumed value.         |

|**Abstract**|            A primary target of the \Euclid space mission is to constrain early-universe physics by searching for deviations from a primordial Gaussian random field. A significant detection of primordial non-Gaussianity would rule out the simplest models of cosmic inflation and transform our understanding of the origin of the Universe. This paper forecasts how well field-level inference of galaxy redshift surveys can constrain the amplitude of local primordial non-Gaussianity ($f_{NL}$), within a Bayesian hierarchical framework, in the upcoming \Euclid data. We design and simulate mock data sets and perform Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses using a full-field forward modelling approach. By including the formation history of the cosmic matter field in the analysis, the method takes into account all available probes of primordial non-Gaussianity, and goes beyond statistical summary estimators of $f_{NL}$. Probes include, for example, two-point and higher-order statistics, peculiar velocity fields, and scale-dependent galaxy biases. Furthermore, the method simultaneously handles systematic survey effects, such as selection effects, survey geometries, and galaxy biases. The forecast shows that the method can reach precision levels of up to $\sigma (f_{NL}) = 2.3$ (68.3\% CI, and at the grid resolution $\Delta L = 62.5\,h^{-1}$Mpc) with \Euclid data. We also provide data products, including realistic $N$-body simulations with nonzero values of $f_{NL}$ and maps of adiabatic curvature fluctuations. The results underscore the feasibility and advantages of field-level inference to constrain $f_{NL}$ in galaxy redshift surveys. Our approach consistently captures all the information available in the large-scale structure to constrain $f_{NL}$, and resolves the degeneracy between early-universe physics and late-time gravitational effects, while mitigating the impact of systematic and observational effects.         |

|**Abstract**|            Secondary cosmic ray fluxes are important probes of the propagation and interaction of high-energy particles in the Galaxy. Recent measurements of primary and secondary cosmic ray nuclei have revealed unexpected spectral features that demand a deeper understanding. In this work we report the direct measurement of the cosmic ray boron spectrum from 10 TeV/n to 8 TeV/n with eight years of data collected by the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) mission. The measured spectrum shows an evident hardening at $182\pm24$ GeV/n with a spectral power index of $\gamma_1 = 3.02 \pm 0.01$ before the break and an index change of $\Delta \gamma = 0.31 \pm 0.05$ after the break. A simple power law model is disfavored at a confidence level of 8$\sigma$. Compared with the hardenings measured in the DAMPE proton and helium spectra, the secondary boron spectrum hardens roughly twice as much as these primaries, which is consistent with a propagation related mechanism to interpret the spectral hardenings of cosmic rays observed at hundreds of GeV/n.         |

|**Abstract**|            With the development of wide-field surveys, a large amount of data on short-period W UMa contact binaries have been obtained. Continuous and uninterrupted light curves as well as high-resolution spectroscopic data are crucial in determining the absolute physical parameters. Targets with both TMTS light curves and LAMOST medium-resolution spectra were selected. The absolute physical parameters were inferred with the W-D code for ten systems, all of them are W-type shallow or medium contact binaries. The O'Connell effect observed in the light curves can be explained by adding a spot on the primary or secondary component in the models. According to O-C analysis, the orbital periods exhibit a long-term increasing or decreasing trend, amongst which J0132, J1300, and J1402 show periodic variations that may be attributed to the presence of a third body or magnetic activity cycles. Spectral subtraction analysis revealed that the equivalent width of H$\alpha$ indicates strong magnetic activity in J0047, J0305, J0638, and J1402. Among the 10 selected binary systems, except for J0132 and J0913, the more massive components are found to be main-sequence stars while the less massive components have evolved off the main sequence. In J0132, both components are in the main sequence, whereas both components of J0913 lie above the terminal-age main sequence. Based on the relationship between orbital angular momentum and total mass for these two systems, as well as their low fill-out factors, it is possible that these two systems are newly formed contact binaries, having recently evolved from the detached configuration.         |

|**Abstract**|            The first JWST/MIRI photometric observations of TRAPPIST-1 b allowed for the detection of the thermal emission of the planet at 15 $\mu m$, suggesting that the planet could be a bare rock with a zero albedo and no redistribution of heat. These observations at 15 $\mu m$ were acquired as part of GTO time that included a twin program at 12.8 $\mu m$ in order to have a measurement in and outside the CO$_2$ absorption band. Here we present five new occultations of TRAPPIST-1 b observed with MIRI in an additional photometric band at 12.8 $\mu m$. We perform a global fit of the 10 eclipses and derive a planet-to-star flux ratio and 1-$\sigma$ error of 452 $\pm$ 86 ppm and 775 $\pm$ 90 ppm at 12.8 $\mu m$ and 15 $\mu m$, respectively. We find that two main scenarios emerge. An airless planet model with an unweathered (fresh) ultramafic surface, that could be indicative of relatively recent geological processes fits well the data. Alternatively, a thick, pure-CO2 atmosphere with photochemical hazes that create a temperature inversion and result in the CO2 feature being seen in emission also works, although with some caveats. Our results highlight the challenges in accurately determining a planet's atmospheric or surface nature solely from broadband filter measurements of its emission, but also point towards two very interesting scenarios that will be further investigated with the forthcoming phase curve of TRAPPIST-1 b.         |
