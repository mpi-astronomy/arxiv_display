|**Abstract**|            We present millimeter observations of the host galaxy of the most distant blazar known, VLASSJ041009.05-013919.88 (hereafter J0410-0139) at z=7, using ALMA and NOEMA observations. The ALMA data reveal a 2e42 erg/s [CII] 158um emission line at z=6.9964 with a [CII]-inferred star-formation rate of 58 Msun/yr. We estimate a dynamical mass of 4.6e9 Msun, implying a black hole mass to host a dynamical mass ratio of 0.15. The 238 GHz continuum (rest-frame IR) decreased by ~33% from the NOEMA to the ALMA observations taken ~10 months apart. The VLA 3-10 GHz radio flux densities showed a ~37% decrease in a similar time frame, suggesting a causal connection. At face value, J0410-0139 would have the lowest [CII]-to-IR luminosity ratio of a z>5.7 quasar reported to date (~1e-4). However, if only <20% of the measured IR luminosity were due to thermal emission from dust, the [CII]-to-IR luminosity ratio would be typical of (U)LIRGS, and the star formation rates derived from [CII] and IR luminosities would be consistent. These results provide further evidence that synchrotron emission significantly contributes to the observed rest-frame IR emission of J0410-0139, similar to what has been reported in some radio-loud AGN at z<1.         |

|**Abstract**|            Giant planets grow and acquire their gas envelope during the disk phase. At the time of the discovery of giant planets in their host disk, it is important to understand the interplay between the host disk and the envelope and circum-planetary disk properties of the planet. Our aim is to investigate the dynamical and physical structure of the gas in the vicinity of a Jupiter-mass planet and study how protoplanetary disk propertiesy, determine the planetary system as well as the accretion rate inside the planet's Hill sphere.We ran global 3D simulations with the grid-based code fargOCA, using a fully radiative equation of state and a dust-to-gas ratio of 0.01. We explored three models. The nominal one features a disk with surface density, Sigma, corresponding to the MMSN at the planet's location, characterised by an alpha viscosity value of 0.004. The second model has a surface density ten times smaller than the nominal one and the same viscosity. In the third model, we also reduced the viscosity value by a factor of 10. During gap formation gas is heated by compression and cools according to opacity, density, and temperature values. In the analysis of our disks, we find that the gas flowing into the Hill sphere is approximately scaled as the product Sigma nu , as expected from viscous transport while The accretion rate is scaled as sqrt(Sigma nu ).Previous studies have shown that pressure or rotationally supported structures are formed around giant planets, depending on the equation of state (EoS) or on the opacity. In the case of a fully radiative EoS and a constant dust to gas ratio of 0.01, we find that low-mass and low-viscosity circum-stellar disks favour the formation of a rotationally supported circum-planetary disk. Gas accretion leading to the doubling time of the planetary system >10^5 years has only been found in the case of a low-viscosity disk.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Tsinghua University--Ma Huateng Telescopes for Survey (TMTS) started to monitor the LAMOST plates in 2020, leading to the discovery of numerous short-period eclipsing binaries, peculiar pulsators, flare stars, and other variable objects. Here, we present the uninterrupted light curves for a sample of 64 cataclysmic variables (CVs) observed/discovered using the TMTS during its first three-year observations, and we introduce new CVs and new light-variation periods (from known CVs) revealed through the TMTS observations. Thanks to the high-cadence observations of TMTS, diverse light variations, including superhumps, quasi-periodic oscillations, large-amplitude orbital modulations, and rotational modulations, are able to be detected in our CV samples, providing key observational clues for understanding the fast-developing physical processes in various CVs. All of these short-timescale light-curve features help further classify the subtypes of CV systems. We highlight the light-curve features observed in our CV sample and discuss further implications of minute-cadence light curves for CV identifications and classifications. Moreover, we examine the H$\alpha$ emission lines in the spectra from our nonmagnetic CV samples (i.e., dwarf novae and nova-like subclasses) and find that the distribution of H$\alpha$ emission strength shows significant differences between the sources with orbital periods above and below the period gap, which agrees with the trend seen from the SDSS nonmagnetic CV sample.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present optical and near-infrared observations of two Type Ibn supernovae (SNe), SN 2018jmt and SN 2019cj. Their light curves have rise times of about 10 days, reaching an absolute peak magnitude of $M_g$(SN 2018jmt) = $-$19.07 $\pm$ 0.37 and $M_V$(SN 2019cj) = $-$18.94 $\pm$ 0.19 mag, respectively. The early-time spectra of SN 2018jmt are dominated by a blue continuum, accompanied by narrow (600$-$1000 km~s$^{-1}$) He I lines with P-Cygni profile. At later epochs, the spectra become more similar to those of the prototypical SN Ibn 2006jc. At early phases, the spectra of SN 2019cj show flash ionisation emission lines of C III, N III and He II superposed on a blue continuum. These features disappear after a few days, and then the spectra of SN 2019cj evolve similarly to those of SN 2018jmt. The spectra indicate that the two SNe exploded within a He-rich circumstellar medium (CSM) lost by the progenitors a short time before the explosion. We model the light curves of the two SNe Ibn to constrain the progenitor and the explosion parameters. The ejecta masses are consistent with either that expected for a canonical SN Ib ($\sim$ 2 M$_{\odot}$) or those from a massive WR star ($>$ $\sim$ 4 M$_{\odot}$), with the kinetic energy on the order of $10^{51}$ erg. The lower limit on the ejecta mass ($>$ $\sim$ 2 M$_{\odot}$) argues against a scenario involving a relatively low-mass progenitor (e.g., $M_{ZAMS}$ $\sim$ 10 M$_{\odot}$). We set a conservative upper limit of $\sim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$ for the $^{56}$Ni masses in both SNe. From the light curve modelling, we determine a two-zone CSM distribution, with an inner, flat CSM component, and an outer CSM with a steeper density profile. The physical properties of SN 2018jmt and SN 2019cj are consistent with those expected from the core collapse of relatively massive, stripped-envelope (SE) stars.         |
