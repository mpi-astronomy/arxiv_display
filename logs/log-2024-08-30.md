|**Abstract**|            We present volume-limited samples of cataclysmic variables (CVs) and AM CVn binaries jointly selected from SRG/eROSITA eRASS1 and \textit{Gaia} DR3 using an X-ray + optical color-color diagram (the ``X-ray Main Sequence"). This tool identifies all CV subtypes, including magnetic and low-accretion rate systems, in contrast to most previous surveys. We find 23 CVs, 3 of which are AM CVns, out to 150 pc in the Western Galactic Hemisphere. Our 150 pc sample is spectroscopically verified and complete down to $L_X = 1.3\times 10^{29} \;\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$ in the 0.2--2.3 keV band, and we also present CV candidates out to 300 pc and 1000 pc. We discovered two previously unknown systems in our 150 pc sample: the third nearest AM CVn and a magnetic period bouncer. We find the mean $L_X$ of CVs to be $\langle L_X \rangle \approx 4.6\times 10^{30} \;\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$, in contrast to previous surveys which yielded $\langle L_X \rangle \sim 10^{31}-10^{32} \;\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$. We construct X-ray luminosity functions that, for the first time, flatten out at $L_X\sim 10^{30} \; \textrm{erg s}^{-1}$. We find average number, mass, and luminosity densities of $\rho_\textrm{N, CV} = (3.7 \pm 0.7) \times 10^{-6} \textrm{pc}^{-3}$, $\rho_M = (5.0 \pm 1.0) \times 10^{-5} M_\odot^{-1}$, and $\rho_{L_X} = (2.3 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{26} \textrm{erg s}^{-1}M_\odot^{-1}$, respectively, in the solar neighborhood. Our uniform selection method also allows us to place meaningful estimates on the space density of AM CVns, $\rho_\textrm{N, AM CVn} = (5.5 \pm 3.7) \times 10^{-7} \textrm{pc}^{-3}$. Magnetic CVs and period bouncers make up $35\%$ and $25\%$ of our sample, respectively. This work, through a novel discovery technique, shows that the observed number densities of CVs and AM CVns, as well as the fraction of period bouncers, are still in tension with population synthesis estimates.         |

|**Abstract**|            The inner disk of the young star PDS 70 may be a site of rocky planet formation, with two giant planets detected further out. Solids in the inner disk may inform us about the origin of this inner disk water and nature of the dust in the rocky planet-forming regions. We aim to constrain the chemical composition, lattice structure, and grain sizes of small silicate grains in the inner disk of PDS 70, observed both in JWST/MIRI MRS and Spitzer IRS. We use a dust fitting model, called DuCK, based on a two-layer disk model. We use Gaussian Random Field and Distribution of Hollow Spheres models to obtain two sets of dust opacities. The third set of opacities is obtained from aerosol spectroscopy. We use stoichiometric amorphous silicates, forsterite, and enstatite in our analysis. We also used iron-rich and magnesium-rich amorphous silicate and fayalite dust species to study the iron content. The Gaussian Random Field opacity agrees well with the observed spectrum. In both MIRI and Spitzer spectra, amorphous silicates are the dominant dust species. Crystalline silicates are dominated by iron-poor olivine. We do not find strong evidence for enstatite. Moreover, the MIRI spectrum indicates larger grain sizes than the Spitzer spectrum, indicating a time-variable small grain reservoir. The inner PDS 70 disk is dominated by a variable reservoir of optically thin warm amorphous silicates. We suggest that the small grains detected in the inner PDS 70 disk are likely transported inward from the outer disk as a result of filtration and fragmentation at the ice line. In addition, the variation between MIRI and Spitzer data can be explained by the grain growth over 15 years and a dynamical inner disk where opacity changes occur resulting from the highly variable hot innermost dust reservoir.         |

|**Abstract**|            The advent of high-resolution, near-infrared instruments such as VLT/SPHERE and Gemini/GPI has helped uncover a wealth of substructure in planet-forming disks, including large, prominent spiral arms in MWC 758, SAO 206462, and V1247 Ori among others. In the classical theory of disk-planet interaction, these arms are consistent with Lindblad-resonance driving by multi-Jupiter-mass companions. Despite improving detection limits, evidence for such massive bodies in connection with spiral substructure has been inconclusive. In search of an alternative explanation, we use the PLUTO code to run 3D hydrodynamical simulations with two comparatively low planet masses (Saturn-mass, Jupiter-mass) and two thermodynamic prescriptions (three-temperature radiation hydrodynamics, and the more traditional $\beta$-cooling) in a low-mass disk. In the radiative cases, an $m = 2$ mode, potentially attributable to the interaction of stellar radiation with gap-edge asymmetries, creates an azimuthal pressure gradient, which in turn gives rise to prominent spiral arms in the upper layers of the disk. Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) post-processing with RADMC3D reveals that in near-infrared scattered light, these gap-edge spirals are significantly more prominent than the traditional Lindblad spirals for planets in the mass range tested. Our results demonstrate that even intermediate-mass protoplanets -- less detectable, but more ubiquitous, than super-Jupiters -- are capable of indirectly inducing large-scale spiral disk features, and underscore the importance of including radiation physics in efforts to reproduce observations.         |

|**Abstract**|            MICADO is a first light instrument for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), set to start operating later this decade. It will provide diffraction limited imaging, astrometry, high contrast imaging, and long slit spectroscopy at near-infrared wavelengths. During the initial phase operations, adaptive optics (AO) correction will be provided by its own natural guide star wavefront sensor. In its final configuration, that AO system will be retained and complemented by the laser guide star multi-conjugate adaptive optics module MORFEO (formerly known as MAORY). Among many other things, MICADO will study exoplanets, distant galaxies and stars, and investigate black holes, such as Sagittarius A* at the centre of the Milky Way. After their final design phase, most components of MICADO have moved on to the manufacturing and assembly phase. Here we summarize the final design of the instrument and provide an overview about its current manufacturing status and the timeline. Some lessons learned from the final design review process will be presented in order to help future instrumentation projects to cope with the challenges arising from the substantial differences between projects for 8-10m class telescopes (e.g. ESO-VLT) and the next generation Extremely Large Telescopes (e.g. ESO-ELT). Finally, the expected performance will be discussed in the context of the current landscape of astronomical observatories and instruments. For instance, MICADO will have similar sensitivity as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), but with six times the spatial resolution.         |
