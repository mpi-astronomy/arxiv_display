|**Abstract**|            JWST has revealed sulfur chemistry in giant exoplanet atmospheres, where molecules such as SO2 trace photochemistry, metallicity, and formation and migration. To ascertain the conditions that determine whether (or how much) SO2, H2S, and other sulfur-bearing species are present in exoplanet atmospheres, we present a grid of planetary atmospheres covering metallicities from 0.3-1000x Solar and temperatures from 250-2050 K. These models map out the 'SO2 shoreline,' the region of metallicity and irradiation for which SO2 may be sufficiently abundant to be detectable. SO2 is a sensitive indicator of metallicity; expected SO2 abundances also depend strongly on overall temperature and C/O ratio; the SO2 abundance depends surprisingly weakly on XUV irradiation, also weakly on Kzz (for Teq > 600 K), and is essentially independent of internal temperature. Despite its detection in a growing number of giant planets, SO2 is never the dominant sulfur-bearing molecule: depending on temperature and metallicity, H2S, S2, NS, SO, SH, and even S8 or atomic S are frequently as common (or more so) as SO2. Nonetheless SO2 remains the most easily detectable sulfur-bearing species, followed by H2S, though perhaps SO and SH could be detectable in some gas giants. Aside from a pressing need for additional observational constraints on sulfur, we also identify the need for future work to account for the effects of clouds and hazes, fully self-consistent atmospheric models, 2D and 3D models, a wider range of planetary masses and radii, and studies to measure and refine reaction rates and molecular opacities of sulfur-bearing species         |

|**Abstract**|            We present new VLTI/GRAVITY astrometry and updated orbit fits for the directly imaged companions YSES 1 b and HR 2562 B, substellar objects straddling the planet-brown dwarf boundary. Using high-precision astrometry, radial velocity (RV) data, and proper motions, we derive revised orbital parameters with orbitize! arXiv:1910.01756. For YSES 1 b, the inclusion of GRAVITY astrometry and a relative radial velocity measurement from arXiv:2409.16660 overcomes the traditional challenge of constraining eccentricities for distant companions, enabling the first orbit fit and yielding a constrained eccentricity of 0.44 (0.20). This represents the first full orbit fit for the system. Additionally, we calculate a median line-of-sight stellar obliquity of 12 (+11, -8) degrees, providing further insight into the system's dynamical architecture. For HR 2562 B, our analysis agrees with arXiv:2302.04893, confirming a low-eccentricity orbit (0.34 (0.20)) and an inclination of 87 (1) degrees. We find HR 2562 B's orbit to be nearly coplanar with the debris disk, with a mutual inclination of 3.7 (0.3) degrees. For both YSES 1 b and HR 2562 B the lower eccentricities favor an in situ formation scenario over extreme scattering or cloud fragmentation.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Multi-Channel Imager (MCI) is a powerful near-ultraviolet (NUV) and visible imager onboard the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST). The MCI provides three imaging channels, which are the NUV channel, the Optical-blue channel and the Optical-red channel, with the wavelength range of 255-430 nm, 430-700 nm, and 700-1000 nm, respectively. The three channels can target the same field simultaneously. Each channel employs a CCD focal plane of 9216 x 9232 pixels and $\sim$7.5 x 7.5 arcmin$^2$ field of view. The MCI's three channels feature unprecedented sensitivities and field of views, as well as rich filter sets, which complements the NUV and visible capabilities of the CSST for the high-precision photometry, the weak-signal detection, and the related sciences. Here we present key design features, results of current ground tests, and suggested observing strategies of the MCI.         |

|**Abstract**|            Coasting cosmology offers an intriguing and straightforward framework for understanding the universe. In this work, we employ the Trans-Planckian Censorship Criterion (TCC) conjecture to test the viability of the coasting cosmology and propose an entropic dark energy (EDE) model within this framework. By applying the holographic principle to constrain the dark energy density and adopting the Bekenstein entropy and Tsallis entropy as the constraining entropies of the system, we find that, in a holographic coasting cosmological framework where dark energy and dark matter evolve independently, the Tsallis entropy satisfies certain general assumptions better than the Bekenstein entropy. Thus, there may be a fundamental relationship between Tsallis entropy and dark energy. We utilize observational data from Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) to constrain EDE model. The optimal Tsallis parameter obtained aligns well with theoretical expectations. To evaluate the model's fit to the observed data, we calculate the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Kullback Information Criterion (KIC), and compare these metrics with those derived from $\Lambda$CDM, under which the model shows some improvement. Overall, this model provides a novel and simple on the evolution of the universe.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH) mission is a NASA Small Explorer to determine the cross-scale processes that unify the solar corona and heliosphere. PUNCH has two science objectives: (1) understand how coronal structures become the ambient solar wind, and (2) understand the dynamic evolution of transient structures, such as coronal mass ejections, in the young solar wind. To address these objectives, PUNCH uses a constellation of four small spacecraft in Sun-synchronous low Earth orbit, to collect linearly polarized images of the K corona and young solar wind. The four spacecraft each carry one visible-light imager in a 1+3 configuration: a single Narrow Field Imager solar coronagraph captures images of the outer corona at all position angles, and at solar elongations from 1.5° (6 R$_\odot$) to 8° (32 R$_\odot$); and three separate Wide Field Imager heliospheric imagers together capture views of the entire inner solar system, at solar elongations from 3° (12 R$_\odot$) to 45° (180 R$_\odot$) from the Sun. PUNCH images include linear-polarization data, to enable inferring the three-dimensional structure of visible features without stereoscopy. The instruments are matched in wavelength passband, support overlapping instantaneous fields of view, and are operated synchronously, to act as a single ``virtual instrument'' with a 90° wide field of view, centered on the Sun. PUNCH launched in March of 2025 and began science operations in June of 2025. PUNCH has an open data policy with no proprietary period, and PUNCH Science Team Meetings are open to all.         |
