|**Abstract**|            The low equilibrium temperatures of temperate sub-Neptunes lead to extremely long chemical timescales in their upper atmospheres, causing the abundances of chemical species to be strongly shaped by atmospheric transport. Here, we used a three-dimensional (3D) general circulation model involving a passive tracer to investigate the atmospheric circulation and 3D transport of temperate gas-rich sub-Neptunes, using K2-18b as an example. We model K2-18b as a synchronous or asynchronous rotator, exploring spin-orbit resonances (SOR) of 2:1, 6:1, and 10:1. We find that the strong absorption of CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ induces a detached convective zone between 1 and 5 bar, resulting in strong vertical mixing at these levels. The upper atmosphere is dominated by eastward winds (an equatorial superrotating jet present in all simulations), leading to warmer evening terminators and approximately 20% higher passive tracer mass mixing ratios compared to the morning terminators. Rotation rates have minimal impact on the strength of global mean vertical mixing, but significantly influence the latitudinal distribution of passive tracers. For synchronous, 2:1 SOR, and 6:1 SOR simulations, passive tracers are more abundant in the upwelling branches at latitudes within 60$^\circ$, while for the 10:1 SOR simulation, strong transient eddies at high latitudes (>70$^\circ$) between 0.1 to 1 bar can transport passive tracers upward from the deep atmosphere, making them more abundant there, despite their alignment with the downwelling branch of the large-scale circulation. This study focuses on the atmospheric dynamics and its influence on passive tracer transport, while a follow-up paper will incorporate active chemical species.         |

|**Abstract**|            We use [CII] observations of a large QSO sample to segregate sources by host galaxy mass, aiming to identify those in the most massive hosts. [CII] luminosity, a known tracer of molecular gas, is taken as a proxy for host mass and used to rank 190 QSOs at z>5.9, spanning a 6-mag UV luminosity range (-22<Muv<-28). Particularly valuable are ALMA data from a cycle-10 CISTERN program, providing [CII] coverage for 46 UV-faint (M_{UV,AB}>-24.5) and 25 especially UV-faint (Muv>-23.5) QSOs, improving statistics by 5x and 6x, respectively. Taking massive host galaxies to be those where L[CII]>1.8x10^9 Lsol (median L[CII] of UV-bright QSOs), we identify 61 QSOs, including 13 which are UV-faint and 7 especially UV-faint. Using these selections and recent QSO luminosity functions (LFs), we present the first characterization of UV luminosity distribution for QSOs in massive host galaxies and quantify [CII] LFs for both UV-bright and UV-faint QSOs. While ~3% of massive-host QSOs are UV-bright (Muv<-26), >~85% are UV-faint (Muv>-24.5). This wide dispersion in UV luminosities reflects variations in dust obscuration, accretion efficiency, and black hole mass. Though spectroscopy is needed for definitive conclusions, black hole mass appears to be the dominant factor driving variations in the UV luminosity, based on 34 [CII]-luminous (L[CII]>1.8x10^9 Lsol) QSOs distributed across a ~3-mag baseline in UV luminosity and with measured MBH. At Muv~-23, the median extrapolated log10 (MBH/Msol) is 8.1+/-0.4, consistent with the local relation. SMBHs in UV-bright QSOs thus appear to be ~15(-9)(+25)x more massive than typical for massive host galaxies at z~6.         |

|**Abstract**|            We apply a halo velocity bias model, $\gamma_{f}$, within the Aemulus simulation suite for General Relativity (GR) to investigate its efficacy in identifying the signature of assembly bias and Modified Gravity (MG). In the investigation of assembly bias, utilizing galaxy clustering data ranging from scales of $0.1 - 60 \text{Mpc}\,h^{-1}$, we discover that our emulator model accurately recreates the cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, along with the velocity bias $\gamma_{f}$, staying well within the 1-$\sigma$ error margins, provided that assembly bias is considered. Ignoring assembly bias can considerably alter our model constraints on parameters $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ if the test sample includes assembly bias. Using our emulator for MG simulations, which encompasses two Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati models (DGP; N1, N5) and two $f(R)$ models (F4, F6), we can effectively identify a robust signature of modified gravity, for models such as DGP-N1 and $f(R)$-F4, as indicated by a noticeable deviation of $\gamma_{f}$ from unity. Using the velocity dispersion of dark matter halos to effectively represent the underlying strength of the velocity field of these MG simulations, we find that the simple $\gamma_{f}$ model can recover the truth with minimal bias. These evaluations indicate that our simple halo-velocity bias model is capable of detecting significant MG characteristics, although additional methodologies should be pursued to improve model constraints.         |

|**Abstract**|            We conducted a timing analysis of PSR J0922+0638 (B0919+06) using data from the Nanshan 26 m radio telescope and the MeerKAT telescope, spanning from January 2001 to March 2023. During this 22-year period, we discovered a previously unreported small glitch (glitch 1) before the well-known large glitch (glitch 2), occurring at ${\rm MJD} \sim 53325(3)$, with a frequency jump amplitude of $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim 0.79(6) \times 10^{-9}$. We also identified ten slow glitch events, half of which were newly detected. These slow glitches occurred quasi-periodically, with an average interval of approximately 553(21) days, fractional frequency changes ranging from $\Delta \nu/\nu \sim 1.13(1) \times 10^{-9}$ to $4.08(5) \times 10^{-9}$, and a maximum fractional change in the first derivative of the frequency of $\Delta \dot{\nu}/\dot{\nu} \sim -4.6 \times 10^{-3}$. Additionally, our timing noise analysis reveals a change in the spectral index for noise power before and after glitch 2, with values of $-6.0$ and $-5.3$, respectively, likely due to this large glitch. Throughout the entire observation period, the first derivative of the spin frequency ($\dot{\nu}$) showed a periodic structure. The possible modulation period was estimated to be 537(24) days before the 700-day data gap at MJD 56716 and 600(58) days afterward. We discuss the periodic oscillations in pulsar rotation as a possible manifestation of spin-down noise and quasi-periodic slow glitches.         |

|**Abstract**|            Based on a unified description of various accretion flows, we find a long-ignored solution - the effectively optically thin accretion flow, occurring at accretion rates around Eddington value. As a consequence of radiation-pressure dominance, the density in a standard thin disc (SSD) decreases with the increase of accretion rates, making the innermost region effectively optically thin. Further increase in accretion rate leads to a rise of the temperature so that the Compton cooling is able to balance the accretion released energy. We demonstrate that the effectively optically thin flow is characterized by moderate temperature and large scattering optical depth, producing a multi-color Wien spectrum. For an appropriate accretion rate, the accretion flow transforms from an outer SSD to an inner effectively optically thin flow. Thus, the spectra of the whole accretion flow exhibit two components, i.e., a multi-color Wien spectrum at higher frequency and a multi-color blackbody, the former could provide an alternative origin of soft X-ray excess or formation of warm corona in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our stability analysis proves it is thermally stable and viscously unstable, indicating its existence in accreting systems. We show that effectively optically thin accretion flow exists in supermassive black holes for accretion rates around 0.1 to 10 times Eddington value, bridging the SSD at low accretion rates and slim disc at high rates. By comparing the predictions and average spectra of AGN, we constrain the viscosity parameter to be $\alpha \sim 0.03$, in good agreement with that derived from observed variability.         |

|| B. Jiang, <mark>J. Li</mark>, X. Chen |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-01*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted for publication in AJ*|
|**Abstract**|            The viability of the star count (Wolf) method is assessed as a means of constraining the near-infrared (NIR) extinction law toward the Corona Australis molecular cloud. Using deep $JHK_S$ photometry from the VISIONS survey, extinction maps with 1 arcmin spatial resolution are constructed. The derived extinction ratios are $A_J/A_H=1.73\pm0.07$, $A_H/A_{K_S}=1.70\pm0.11$, and $A_J/A_{K_S}=3.02\pm0.22$, which are consistent with Galactic literature means. Assuming a power-law form ($A_\lambda \propto \lambda^{-\alpha}$) for the NIR extinction law, we derive indices of $\alpha\approx 2.0$ across all wavelength combinations, with no statistically significant wavelength dependence throughout the NIR wavelength range. While spatial variations in extinction properties are tentatively observed across the cloud, concerns persist regarding the impact of photometric completeness, and the role of reference field selection. Continued research is required to refine the approach, and scrutinize the veracity of potential extinction law variations over a more expansive region of sky.         |

|**Abstract**|            The center of our galaxy hosts Sagittarius~A*, a supermassive compact object of $\sim 4.3\times 10^6$ solar masses, usually associated with a black hole. Nevertheless, black holes possess a central singularity, considered unphysical, and an event horizon, which leads to loss of unitarity in a quantum description of the system. To address these theoretical inconsistencies, alternative models, collectively known as exotic compact objects, have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the potential detectability of signatures associated with non-rotating exotic compact objects within the Sgr~A* polarized flares dataset, as observed through GRAVITY and future instruments. We examine a total of eight distinct metrics, originating from four different categories of static and spherically symmetric compact objects: Black Holes, Boson stars, Fluid spheres, and Gravastars. Our approach involves utilizing a toy model that orbits the compact object in the equatorial plane, at the Schwarzschild-Keplerian velocity. Using simulated astrometric and polarimetric data with present GRAVITY and future GRAVITY+ uncertainties, we fit the datasets across all metrics examined. We evaluated the detectability of the metric for each dataset based on the resulting $\chi^2_\mathrm{red}$ and BIC-based Bayes factors. Plunge-through images of ECOs affect polarization and astrometry. With GRAVITY's present uncertainties, only a compact boson-star model is discernible. GRAVITY+'s improved sensitivity allows detection of most exotic compact object models. However, enhancing the astrophysical complexity of the hot spot model diminishes these outcomes. Presently, GRAVITY's uncertainties limit us to detecting just one exotic compact object metric. With GRAVITY+'s enhanced sensitivity, we can expect to uncover additional exotic compact object models and use Sgr~A* as a laboratory for fundamental physics.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2025-07-01*|

|**Abstract**|            Gravitational systems in astrophysics often comprise a body -- the primary -- that far outweights the others, and which is taken as the centre of the reference frame. A fictitious acceleration, also known as the indirect term, must therefore be added to all other bodies in the system to compensate for the absence of motion of the primary. In this paper, we first stress that there is not one indirect term but as many indirect terms as there are bodies in the system that exert a gravitational pull on the primary. For instance, in the case of a protoplanetary disc with two planets, there are three indirect terms: one arising from the whole disc, and one per planet. We also highlight that the direct and indirect gravitational accelerations should be treated in a balanced way: the indirect term from one body should be applied to the other bodies in the system that feel its direct gravitational acceleration, and only to them. We point to situations where one of those terms is usually neglected however, which may lead to spurious results. These ideas are developed here for star-disc-planets interactions, for which we propose a recipe for the force to be applied onto a migrating planet, but they can easily be generalized to other astrophysical systems.         |
