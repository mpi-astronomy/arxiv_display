|**Abstract**|            The temperature of the cold dust in z>6 galaxies is a potential tracer of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) and stellar feedback, and is the dominant source of uncertainty in inferring properties from the far-infrared (FIR) emission of these galaxies. We present the first resolved dust temperature map in a $z>6$ quasar host galaxy. We combine new 360 pc resolution ALMA Band 9 continuum observations with literature 190 pc Band 6 observations to derive the dust temperature and opacity at 0.1<r<0.5 kpc scales in a $z=6.9$ luminous quasar host galaxy (J2348-3054). We find that the dust temperature (and opacity) increases at the center (r<216 pc) of the galaxy up to $T_d=73-88$ K, and potentially up to $T_d<149$ K at r<110 pc. The combination of the resolved and integrated FIR Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) further reveal a dust temperature gradient and a significant contribution of the AGN hot dust torus at $\nu_{\rm{obs}}\gtrsim 700$ GHz. By taking into account the torus contribution and resolved optically-thick emission, we derive a total infrared luminosity ($L_{TIR}=8.78\pm0.10)\times 10^{12}L_\odot$) and corresponding star-formation rate (SFR$=1307\pm15\ M_\odot\ \rm{yr}^{-1}$), that are at least a factor $\sim 3.6$ ($\sim0.56$ dex) lower than previous measurements assuming optically-thin emission. We compare the resolved dust temperature, mass and IR luminosity profiles to simulations where they are only reproduced by models in which the AGN radiation heats the dust in the center of the galaxy. Our observations provide evidence that dust in J2348--3054 cannot be assumed to be uniformly cold and optically thin. Whether J2348-3054 is representative of the larger population of high-redshift quasars and galaxies remains to be determined with dedicated high-resolution and high-frequency ALMA observations.         |

|**Abstract**|            GK Persei, an old nova and intermediate polar (IP), exhibited a dwarf nova (DN) outburst in 2010. This outburst was extensively observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, beginning 1.95 days after the eruption and continuing until 13.9 days before the maximum of the outburst in the optical. In this paper, we present timing and spectral analyses, comparing the results with those of other outbursts. We confirm the spin modulation in the 2 $-$ 10 keV X-ray range with a period of $P_{\rm WD} = 351.325(9)$ s. Additionally, we detected spin modulation in the 0.3 $-$ 2 keV band during the second half of the observations, a feature not seen in the 2015 and 2018 outbursts. This finding suggests that the soft X-ray emission in GK Per may originate partly near the magnetic poles and partly from a wind or circumstellar material.         |

|| S. Zou, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-02-21*|
|*Comments*| *21 pages, 7 figures, 1 table in the main text, submitted*|
|**Abstract**|            Cold and cool gas (T $\leq 10^4$ K) in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and its interaction with galaxies remain poorly understood. Simulations predict that cold gas flows into galaxies through cosmic filaments, determining the disk formation and galaxy evolution. The cold gas accretion modes in the CGM and their dependence on dark matter halo mass and redshift remain puzzling. Resolving the kiloparsec-scale kinematics and dynamics of cold gas interacting with the disk, dust, and metals in different environments is particularly lacking at z > 2. Here we report two disturbed cold gas structures traced by ultra-strong MgII absorbers (rest-frame equivalent width Wr > 2 Å) exhibiting high kinematic velocities (> 500 km/s) and their environments at z ~ 4.9 and z ~ 2.6. Observations were conducted with VLT/MUSE, JWST/NIRCam, and ALMA to detect Lya and nebular emission lines, as well as dust continuum emission in the vicinity of these two absorbing gas structures. We identify two Lya emitters associated with a strong MgII absorber pair separated by ~1000 km/s at z~ 4.87. The pair exhibits relative differences in metallicity, dust content, and ionization states, suggesting internal metal and dust exchange within the ultra-large cold gas structure. For the strong MgII absorber at z = 2.5652$, we detect a dusty star-forming galaxy at a projected distance of $D = 38$ kpc. This galaxy exhibits prominent HeI, [SIII], and Paschen$\gamma$ lines, along with significant dust continuum. It has a star formation rate of ~ 121 +/- 33 $M_{\odot}$/yr and likely harbors a rotating disk. These findings tentatively suggest that cold gas at high redshifts plays a critical role in driving disk formation and actively participates in the transfer of metals and dust within the overdense regions of the CGM.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present 3 years of high-contrast imaging of the PDS 70 b and c accreting protoplanets with the new extreme AO system MagAO-X as part of the MaxProtoPlanetS survey of H$\alpha$ protoplanets. In 2023 and 2024 our sharp (25-27 mas FWHM); well AO corrected (20-26% Strehl), deep (2-3.6hr) images detect compact (r~30 mas; r~3 au) circumplanetary disks (CPDs) surrounding both protoplanets. Starlight scattering off the dusty outer edges of these CPDs is the likely source of the bright compact continuum light detected within ~30 mas of both planets in our simultaneously obtained continuum 668 nm filter images. After subtraction of contaminating continuum and PSF residuals with pyKLIP ADI and SDI we obtained high-contrast ASDI H$\alpha$ images of both planets in 2022, 2023 and 2024. We find the H$\alpha$ line flux of planet b fell by (8.1$\pm$1.6)x10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$ a factor of 4.6 drop in flux from 2022 to 2023. In March 2024, planet b continued to be faint with just a slight 1.6x rise to an H$\alpha$ line flux of (3.64$\pm$0.87)x10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$. For c we measure a significant increase of (2.74$\pm$0.51)x10$^{-16}$ ergs/s/cm$^2$ from 2023 to 2024 which is a factor of 2.3x increase. So both protoplanets have recently experienced significant H$\alpha$ variability with ~1 yr sampling. In 2024, planet c is brighter than b: as c is brightening and b generally fading. We also tentatively detect one new point source "CC3" inside the inner disk (~49 mas; at PA~295 deg; 2024) with orbital motion roughly consistent with a ~5.6 au orbit.         |
