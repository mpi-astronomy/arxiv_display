|**Abstract**|            Aims: The precision of cosmological constraints from imaging surveys hinges on accurately estimating the redshift distribution $ n(z) $ of tomographic bins, especially their mean redshifts. We assess the effectiveness of the clustering redshifts technique in constraining Euclid tomographic redshift bins to meet the target uncertainty of $ \sigma ( \langle z \rangle ) < 0.002 (1 + z) $. In this work, these mean redshifts are inferred from the small-scale angular clustering of Euclid galaxies, which are distributed into bins with spectroscopic samples localised in narrow redshift slices. Methods: We generate spectroscopic mocks from the Flagship2 simulation for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), and Euclid's Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) spectroscopic survey. We evaluate and optimise the clustering redshifts pipeline, introducing a new method for measuring photometric galaxy bias (clustering), which is the primary limitation of this technique. Results: We have successfully constrained the means and standard deviations of the redshift distributions for all of the tomographic bins (with a maximum photometric redshift of 1.6), achieving precision beyond the required thresholds. We have identified the main sources of bias, particularly the impact of the 1-halo galaxy distribution, which imposed a minimal separation scale of 1.5 Mpc for evaluating cross-correlations. These results demonstrate the potential of clustering redshifts to meet the precision requirements for Euclid, and we highlight several avenues for future improvements.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Virgo Filament Survey (VFS) is a comprehensive study of galaxies that reside in the extended filamentary structures surrounding the Virgo Cluster, out to 12 virial radii. The primary goal is to characterize all of the dominant baryonic components within galaxies and to understand whether and how they are affected by the filament environment. A key constituent of VFS is a narrowband H$\alpha$ imaging survey of over 600 galaxies, VFS-H$\alpha$. The H$\alpha$ images reveal detailed, resolved maps of the ionized gas and massive star-formation. This imaging is particularly powerful as a probe of environmentally-induced quenching because different physical processes affect the spatial distribution of star formation in different ways. In this paper, we present the first results from the VFS-H$\alpha$ for the NGC~5364 group, a low-mass ($\log_{10}(M_{dyn}/M_\odot) < 13)$ system located at the western edge of the Virgo~III filament. We combine H$\alpha$ imaging with resolved H~I observations from MeerKAT for eight group members. These galaxies exhibit peculiar morphologies, including strong distortions in the stars and the gas, truncated H~I and H$\alpha$ disks, H~I tails, extraplanar H$\alpha$ emission, and off-center H$\alpha$ emission. These signatures are suggestive of environmental processing such as tidal interactions, ram pressure stripping, and starvation. We quantify the role of ram pressure stripping expected in this group, and find that it can explain the cases of H~I tails and truncated H-alpha for all but one of the disk-dominated galaxies. Our observations indicate that multiple physical mechanisms are disrupting the baryon cycle in these group galaxies.         |

|**Abstract**|            We constrain the evolution of dark matter energy density over time, specifically focusing on deviation from the standard model represented by the equation $\rho_{m}\propto(1+z)^{3-\varepsilon}$, where $\varepsilon$ is a constant parameter. Utilizing a diverse array of observational datasets, including baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data from the first release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), distance priors derived from cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations by the Planck satellite, Hubble rate data obtained through the cosmic chronometers (CC) method, type Ia supernova (SNIa) data from the Panthon sample, and the data from the redshift space distortion (RSD) measurements ($f\sigma_8$), we derive stringent constraints on the deviation parameter. We find that for the model under consideration, the deviation parameter is constrained to be $\varepsilon = -0.0073^{+0.0029}_{-0.0033}$, indicating a deviation of approximately $2.4\sigma$ from the scenario where dark matter and vacuum dark energy do not interact. When compared with previous studies and alternative analyses, our findings provide corroborative evidence for an interaction between dark matter and vacuum dark energy, particularly in light of the release of BAO data from DESI.         |

|**Abstract**|            Recently, the gravitational wave (GW) event for black hole (BH)-BH mergers, S241125n, has been reported to be associated with a short gamma-ray burst (GRB) and X-ray afterglow emission. Such an association could potentially unveil the environments of mergers and provide attractive targets for multi-messenger observations. We summarize these observations and model it as a binary BH merger occurring within an active galactic nucleus (AGN), where the merger remnant accretes disk material at hyper-Eddington rates. The resulting jet could lead to the GRB associated with the GW event. The GRB, detected by Swift-BAT, exhibits a Comptonized spectrum with an unusually soft photon index, which is consistent with emission from the jet interacting the emission associated with the dense AGN disk environment. Its X-ray afterglow shows an unusually hard spectrum, indicating possible strong absorption by a high column density typical of AGN disks. We highlight the importance of identifying the host galaxy and conducting more sensitive infrared observations to test the model.         |
