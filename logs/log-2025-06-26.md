|**Abstract**|            Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow primarily through gas accretion, observed as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While mergers can drive luminous AGN episodes, secular processes may fuel a substantial portion of cosmic BH growth. Whether these mechanisms can sustain high BH accretion rates remains uncertain. This study aims to identify the secular mechanism driving high BH accretion rates, by targeting a galaxy with moderately massive SMBH, high central gas densities, accretion rates of a few percent of the Eddington limit, and gas kinematics resolved close to black hole-dominated scales. A blind search led to the identification of NGC 4593, which is representative of the AGN population driving BH mass density growth since $z=1$. A prominent single-arm ("$m=1$") molecular gas spiral with ${\rm log}\,M_{\rm mol}/{\rm M}_\odot=8.1\pm0.3$ extends from 1.3$\,$kpc down to the SMBH's sphere of influence ($1.7^{+0.5}_{-0.2}\,{\rm pc}$). Star formation in the spiral is inefficient (${\rm SFR} = 4.9 \times 10^{-2} \,{\rm M}_\odot {\rm /yr}$, $\langle t_{\rm dep}\rangle=3.9 \pm 0.6\,\rm{Gyr}$), whereas inflow rate exceeds the SFR by two orders of magnitude and is sufficient to sustain the current BH accretion rate for $\geq$35$\,$Myr, enabling $\sim$10% SMBH growth. A young, lopsided stellar component (${\rm log}\,M_\star/{\rm M}_\odot=7.5-9.3$) exerts torques on the molecular gas, likely driving the gas inflow. This young stellar component may serve as both a cause and a product of sustained gas funnelling towards the SMBH. These findings provide evidence for the sustained secular $m=1$ feeding mode at high BH accretion rates, linking kpc-scale gas dynamics to the black hole's sphere of influence. This mechanism, consistent with simulation predictions, may represent a key contributor to SMBH growth in luminous AGNs since cosmic noon.         |

|**Abstract**|            The young M-star TWA 7 hosts a bright and near face-on debris disk, which has been imaged from the optical to the submillimeter. The disk displays multiple complex substructures such as three disk components, a large dust clump, and spiral arms, suggesting the presence of planets to actively sculpt these features. The evidence for planets in this disk was further strengthened with the recent detection of a point-source compatible with a Saturn-mass planet companion using JWST/MIRI at 11 $\mu$m, at the location a planet was predicted to reside based on the disk morphology. In this paper, we present new observations of the TWA 7 system with JWST/NIRCam in the F200W and F444W filters. The disk is detected at both wavelengths and presents many of the same substructures as previously imaged, although we do not robustly detect the southern spiral arm. Furthermore, we detect two faint potential companions in the F444W filter at the 2-3$\sigma$ level. While one of these companions needs further followup to determine its nature, the other one coincides with the location of the planet candidate imaged with MIRI, providing further evidence that this source is a sub-Jupiter mass planet companion rather than a background galaxy. Such discoveries make TWA 7 only the second system, after $\beta$ Pictoris, in which a planet predicted by the debris disk morphology has been detected.         |

|**Abstract**|            The dusty interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way is distributed in a complex, cloudy structure. It is fundamental to the radiation balance within the Milky Way, provides a reaction surface to form complex molecules, and is the feedstock for future generations of stars and planets. The life cycle of interstellar dust is not completely understood, and neither are its structure nor composition. The abundance, composition, and structure of dust in the diffuse ISM can be determined by combining infrared, optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy. JWST enables measurement of the faint absorption of ISM dust grains against bright stars at kiloparsec distances across the infrared spectrum. Here we present an overview of the project `Webb Investigation of Silicates, Carbons, and Ices' (WISCI) along with interpretation of two targets, GSC 08152-02121 and CPD-59 5831. Observations of 12 WISCI target stars were taken by JWST, the Hubble Space Telescope, Himalayan Chandra Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope. We use these to characterize the targets' spectral types and calculate their line-of-sight extinction parameters, $A_{\rm V}$ and $R_{\rm V}$. We find absorption in the JWST spectra of GSC 08152-02121, and CPD-59 5831 associated with carbonaceous dust around 3.4 and 6.2 micron and amorphous silicates at 9.7 micron. In GSC 08152-02121 we also find indications of absorption by trapped water around 3 micron. This first look from WISCI demonstrates the line-of-sight variability within the sample, and the program's potential to identify and correlate features across ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths.         |

|**Abstract**|            The aim of this work is to obtain precise atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances automatically for solar twins and analogs to find signatures of exoplanets, as well as to assess how peculiar the Sun is compared to these stars and to analyze any possible fine structures in the Galactic thin disk. We developed a neural network (NN) algorithm using Python to obtain these parameters for a sample of 99 solar twins and solar analogs previously studied in the literature from normalized high-quality spectra from HARPS, with a resolving power of R $\sim$ 115000 and a signal-to-noise ratio S/N > 400. We obtained precise atmospheric parameters and abundance ratios [X/Fe] of 20 chemical elements (Li, C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, and Ba). The results are in line with the literature, with average differences and standard deviations of $(2 \pm 27)$ K for T$_{\rm eff}$, $(0.00 \pm 0.06)$ dex for log g, $(0.00 \pm 0.02)$ dex for [Fe/H], $(-0.01 \pm 0.05)$ km s$^{-1}$ for microturbulence velocity, $(0.02 \pm 0.08)$ km s$^{-1}$ for the macro turbulence velocity, and $(-0.12 \pm 0.26)$ km s$^{-1}$ for the projected rotational velocity (vsin$i$). Regarding the chemical abundances, most of the elements agree with the literature within 0.01 - 0.02 dex. The abundances were corrected from the effects of the Galactic chemical evolution and analyzed with the condensation temperature (T$_{\rm cond}$) to verify whether the stars presented depletion of refractories compared to volatiles. We found that the Sun is more depleted in refractory elements compared to volatiles than 89% of the studied solar analogs, with a significance of 9.5$\sigma$ when compared to the stars without detected exoplanets. We also found the possible presence of three subpopulations in the solar analogs: one Cu-rich, one Cu-poor, and the last one slightly older and poor in Na.         |

|**Abstract**|            Clusters of galaxies host spectacular diffuse radio sources, extending over scales from 100 kpc to several Mpcs. These sources, with extremely faint surface brightness ($\mu$Jy/arcsec$^2$ level), are not tied to individual galaxies but trace synchrotron emission from large-scale magnetic fields and relativistic particles within the intracluster environment. Here, we report the discovery of a candidate radio mini-halo in SpARCS104922.6+564032.5, the most distant cool-core galaxy cluster identified to date at $z=1.709$, using deep LOFAR 120-168 MHz observations. We show that this emission originates from diffuse cluster-associated processes rather than unresolved AGN or star-forming galaxies. The diffuse radio emission coincides spatially with the X-ray emission of the hot intracluster medium and has a radio power of $P_{\rm 150~MHz}=49.8^{+14.7}_{-11.7} \times10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, exhibiting striking similarities to low-redshift radio mini-halos. This discovery doubles the redshift of previously known mini-halos, challenging models of inverse Compton losses and indicating the presence of strong magnetic fields, enhanced turbulence in high-redshift clusters, or active hadronic processes that require a cosmic ray-to-thermal energy ratio of 0.07 within 200 kpc, assuming a clumped distribution with spatial correlations among the gas, cosmic rays, and magnetic field that partially compensate for cosmological redshift dimming. It further implies that magnetic fields are efficiently amplified to $\sim$$10~\mu$G levels within a Mpc$^3$ volume during the epoch of cluster formation before $z\sim2$. These findings provide critical insights into high-redshift cluster physics and emphasize the transformative potential of next-generation radio surveys, such as those with the SKA and ngVLA, in exploring the early evolution of galaxy clusters.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report the discovery and confirmation of TOI-4465 b, a $1.25^{+0.08}_{-0.07}~R_{J}$, $5.89\pm0.26~M_{J}$ giant planet orbiting a G dwarf star at $d\simeq$ 122 pc. The planet was detected as a single-transit event in data from Sector 40 of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. Radial velocity (RV) observations of TOI-4465 showed a planetary signal with an orbital period of $\sim$102 days, and an orbital eccentricity of $e=0.24\pm0.01$. TESS re-observed TOI-4465 in Sector 53 and Sector 80, but did not detect another transit of TOI-4465 b, as the planet was not expected to transit during these observations based on the RV period. A global ground-based photometry campaign was initiated to observe another transit of TOI-4465 b after the RV period determination. The $\sim$12 hour-long transit event was captured from multiple sites around the world, and included observations from 24 citizen scientists, confirming the orbital period as $\sim$102 days. TOI-4465 b is a relatively dense ($3.73\pm0.53~\rm{g/cm^3}$), temperate (375-478 K) giant planet. Based on giant planet structure models, TOI-4465 b appears to be enriched in heavy elements at a level consistent with late-stage accretion of icy planetesimals. Additionally, we explore TOI-4465 b's potential for atmospheric characterization, and obliquity measurement. Increasing the number of long-period planets by confirming single-transit events is crucial for understanding the frequency and demographics of planet populations in the outer regions of planetary systems.         |

|| <mark>Y. Wang</mark>, et al. |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-06-26*|

|**Abstract**|            We have developed a lightweight tool {\tt RapidGBM}, featured by a web-based interface and capabilities of rapid calculation of Fermi-GBM visibilities and performing basic data analysis. It has two key features: (1) immediately check the visibility of Fermi-GBM for new transients, and (2) check the light curve and perform spectral analysis after the hourly TTE data is released. The visibility check and the response matrix generation required for spectral analysis can be achieved through the historical pointing file after the orbit calculation, even when the real-time pointing file is not yet available. As a case, we apply the tool to EP240617a, an X-ray transient triggered by Einstein Probe (EP). We demonstrate the workflow of visibility checking, data processing, and spectral analysis for this event. The results suggest that EP240617a can be classified as an X-ray-rich GRB (XRR) and confirm the feasibility of using historical pointing files for rapid analysis. Further, we discuss possible physical interpretations of such events, including implications for jet launching and progenitor scenarios. Therefore, {\tt RapidGBM} is expected to assist Einstein Probe Transient Advocates (EP-TAs), Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor Burst Advocates (SVOM-BAs), and other members of the community in cross-checking high-energy transients. Based on prompt emission parameter relations (e.g. $E_{\rm p}$-$E_{\gamma,\rm iso}$), it can also help identify peculiar GRBs (e.g. long-short burst, magnetar giant flare, etc.) and and provide useful references (e.g. more accurate $T_0$) for scheduling follow-up observations.         |

|**Abstract**|            The magnetic fields and dynamical processes in the solar polar regions play a crucial role in the solar magnetic cycle and in supplying mass and energy to the fast solar wind, ultimately being vital in controlling solar activities and driving space weather. Despite numerous efforts to explore these regions, to date no imaging observations of the Sun's poles have been achieved from vantage points out of the ecliptic plane, leaving their behavior and evolution poorly understood. This observation gap has left three top-level scientific questions unanswered, 1) How does the solar dynamo work and drive the solar magnetic cycle? 2) What drives the fast solar wind? 3) How do space weather processes globally originate from the Sun and propagate throughout the solar system? The Solar Polar-orbit Observatory (SPO) mission, a solar polar exploration spacecraft, is proposed to address these three unanswered scientific questions by imaging the Sun's poles from high heliolatitudes. In order to achieve its scientific goals, SPO will carry six remote-sensing and four in-situ instruments to measure the vector magnetic fields and Doppler velocity fields in the photosphere, to observed the Sun in the extreme ultraviolet, X-ray, and radio wavelengths, to image the corona and the heliosphere up to 45 $R_\odot$, and to perform in-situ detection of magnetic fields, and low- and high-energy particles in the solar wind.         |
