|**Abstract**| Observed scatter in the Lyman-alpha opacity of quasar sightlines at $z<6$ has motivated measurements of the correlation between Ly$\alpha$ opacity and galaxy density, as models that predict this scatter make strong and sometimes opposite predictions for how they should be related. Our previous work associated two highly opaque Ly$\alpha$ troughs at $z\sim5.7$ with a deficit of Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting galaxies (LAEs). In this work, we survey two of the most highly transmissive lines of sight at this redshift, towards the $z=6.02$ quasar SDSS J1306+0356 and the $z=6.17$ quasar PSO J359-06. We find that both fields are underdense in LAEs within 10 $h^{-1}$ Mpc of the quasar sightline, somewhat less extensive than underdensities associated with Ly$\alpha$ troughs. We combine our observations with three additional fields from the literature, and find that while fields with extreme opacities are generally underdense, moderate opacities span a wider density range. The results at high opacities are consistent with models that invoke UV background fluctuations and/or late reionization to explain the observed scatter in IGM Ly$\alpha$ opacities. There is tension at low opacities, however, as the models tend to associate lower IGM Ly$\alpha$ opacities with higher densities. Although the number of fields surveyed is still small, the low-opacity results may support a scenario in which the ionizing background in low-density regions increases more rapidly than some models suggest after becoming ionized. Elevated gas temperatures from recent reionization may also be making these regions more transparent. |
