|**Abstract**|            In Paper I, we classified a stellar sample from the thin disc with a broad range in metallicity as being churned outward or inward, or blurred/undisturbed. In this paper (Paper II), we delve deeper by analysing our entire metallicity-stratified sample along with their dynamic properties, focusing on the connection between radial migration and Li depletion. We analyse the chemo-dynamics of a set of 1188 thin disc dwarf stars observed by the \textit{Gaia}-ESO survey, previously classified into six metallicity-stratified groups via Hierarchical Clustering (HC). We examine several features, such as effective temperatures, masses, and dynamic properties. We also implement a parametric survival analysis using penalised splines (logistic distribution) to quantify how stellar properties and motion (or migration) direction jointly influence Li depletion patterns. We find that stars in our sample that appear to have churned outward are predominantly Li-depleted, regardless of their metallicities. These stars are also the oldest, coldest, and least massive compared to those in the same HC group that have either churned inward or kept their orbital radii. Our survival analysis confirms temperature as the primary driver of Li depletion, followed by metallicity and age, while migration direction shows negligible influence. The increasing proportion of outward-churned stars with higher metallicity (and older ages) indicates their dominant influence on the overall trend observed in the [Fe/H]-A(Li) space for stellar groups with [Fe/H]>0. The survival model reinforces that the observed Li depletion stems primarily from intrinsic stellar properties (cool temperatures, higher metallicity, old ages) rather than migration history. This suggests the metallicity-dependent depletion pattern emerges through stellar evolution rather than Galactic dynamical processes.         |

|**Abstract**|            Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements and Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, we have measured the dark energy density $\rho_X(z)$ and dark energy equation of state $w_X(z)$ as free functions of redshift (smoothly interpolated from values at $z=0, 1/3, 2/3, 1, 4/3, 2.33$), and find both to be consistent with a cosmological constant, with only deviations of 1.2$\sigma$ for $\rho_X(z)$ and 1.9$\sigma$ for $w_X(z)$ at $z=2/3$. We confirm our earlier finding in Wang & Freese (2006) that $w_X(z)$ is significantly less constrained by data than $\rho_X(z)$. Our results differ noticeably from those of the DESI Collaboration, in which they used the same DESI DR2 data combined with Planck data and found a 3.1$\sigma$ deviation from a cosmological constant, a finding which is the consequence of their assuming the parametrization $w_X(z)=w_0+w_a(1-a)$. Our results indicate that assuming a linear $w_X(z)$ could be misleading and precludes discovering how dark energy actually varies with time at higher redshifts. In our quest to discover the physical nature of dark energy, the most urgent goal at present is to determine definitively whether dark energy density varies with time. We have demonstrated that it is of critical importance to measure dark energy density as a free function of redshift from data. Future galaxy redshift surveys by Euclid and Roman at higher redshifts will significantly advance our understanding of dark energy.         |

|**Abstract**|            Accretion onto supermassive black hole (SMBH) releases energy via radiation, jets or winds, providing feedback effects on the circumnuclear gas environment. However, the dynamics of accreting gas on sub-parsec scales near the SMBH remains poorly understood. With high-resolution X-ray spectra of Mrk 3, we detect a fast inflowing ionized absorber characterized by redshifted Fe XXV and Fe XXVI absorption lines. Photoionization modeling reveals the inflowing absorber is located at $\lesssim0.04-0.74\rm~pc$ and is decelerating from $6.1\pm0.5\times10^3\rm~km~s^{-1}$ to $3.4\pm0.3\times10^3\rm~km~s^{-1}$ over 11 years. Only $\sim0.6$\%--$3$\% of the inflowing material is estimated to reach the event horizon. This direct evidence of sub-parsec scale fueling inflow bridges the gap between the torus and the outer accretion disk. Furthermore, a $0.86$-keV gas component with sub-solar metallicity ($Z\sim0.22$), outflowing at a velocity of $\sim330\rm~km~s^{-1}$, is detected in the soft X-ray band. It may corresponds to the [O III] biconical outflow in the narrow-line region. A putative ultra-fast disk wind outside our line-of-sight, or clouds within the broad-line region, are promising candidates for decelerating the inflowing absorber.         |

|| P. Cheng, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            In this manuscript, an improved Seyfert-LINER classification line (= S-L line) is proposed in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram, based on a sample of 47,968 low redshift narrow emission line galaxies from SDSS DR16, motivated by different S-L lines reported in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram through different methods. The method proposed by Kewley et al. in 2006 is firstly applied, however, the method cannot lead to an accepted S-L line in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram. Meanwhile, the S-L lines proposed by Schawinski et al. in 2007 and Cid Fernandes et al. in 2010 in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram are different from each other. Therefore, it is meaningful to check which proposed S-L line is better or to determine an improved one in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram by a new method. In this manuscript, Seyferts and LINERs that have already been classified in the [S~{\sc ii}] and/or [O~{\sc i}] BPT diagrams can be visualized in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram, leading the intersection boundary of the two contour maps to be considered as the S-L line in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram. Rather than the previously proposed S-L lines, the new S-L line can lead to more efficient and harmonious classifications of Seyferts and LINERs, especially in the composite galaxy region, in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram. Furthermore, based on the discussed S-L lines, the number ratio of Type-2 Seyferts to Type-2 LINERs differs significantly from that of Type-1 Seyferts to Type-1 LINERs in the [N~{\sc ii}] BPT diagram, suggesting that about 90$\%$ of Type-2 LINERs are non-AGN-related objects, true Type-2 AGNs, or objects exhibiting both Seyfert and LINER characteristics.         |
