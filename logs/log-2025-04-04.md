|**Abstract**|            Tidal interactions between massive galaxies and their satellites are fundamental processes in a Universe with L-Cold Dark Matter cosmology, redistributing material into faint features that preserve records of past galactic interactions. While stellar streams in the Local Group impressively demonstrate satellite disruption, they do not constitute a statistically significant sample. Constructing a substantial catalog of stellar streams beyond the Local Group remains challenging due to the difficulties in obtaining deep, wide-field images of galaxies. Despite their potential to illuminate dark matter distribution and galaxy formation processes, stellar streams remain underutilized as cosmological probes. The Stellar Tidal Stream Survey (STSS) addresses this observational gap by leveraging amateur telescopes to obtain deep, scientific-grade images of galactic outskirts, capable of building a more statistically meaningful sample of stellar streams. Over the last decade, the STSS has acquired deep (up to surface brightness limit 28.3 mag/arcsec^2 in the r-band), wide-field images of 15 nearby Milky Way analog galaxies using a network of robotic amateur telescopes, avoiding the issues associated with "mosaicing" smaller images taken with a professional telescope. Our survey has revealed a diverse range of previously unreported faint features related to dwarf satellite accretion - including stellar streams, shells, and umbrella-like structures. We discover an ultra-diffuse galaxy (NGC150-UDG1), which shows hints of tidal tails. The STSS demonstrates the suitability of modern amateur telescopes to detect and study faint, diffuse structures in large fields around nearby spiral galaxies. Their economic and accessibility advantages enable larger samples with deep imaging, essential for testing galaxy formation models and constraining the properties of minor merger events in the local Universe.         |

|**Abstract**|            Context: Dust grains are key components of the interstellar medium and play a central role in star formation, acting as catalysts for chemical reactions and as building blocks of planets. Extinction curves are essential for characterizing dust properties, but mid-infrared (MIR) extinction remains poorly constrained in protostellar environments. Gas-phase line ratios from embedded protostellar jets provide a spatially resolved method for probing extinction through protostellar envelopes, complementing background starlight approaches. Aims: We aim to derive MIR extinction curves along sightlines toward a protostellar jet embedded in an envelope and assess whether they differ from those in dense molecular clouds. Methods: We analyze JWST NIRSpec IFU and MIRI MRS observations of four positions along the blue-shifted TMC1A jet. We extract observed [Fe II] line intensities and model intrinsic ratios using the Cloudy spectral synthesis code across a range of electron densities and temperatures. By comparing observed near-IR (NIR) and MIR line ratios to Cloudy predictions, we infer the relative extinction between NIR and MIR wavelengths. Results: Electron densities (ne) derived from NIR [Fe II] lines range from ~5 x 10^4 to ~5 x 10^3 cm^-3 at scales <~350 AU. MIR extinction values show stronger reddening than the empirical dark cloud curve from McClure (2009) at similar ne and temperatures (~10^3 to 10^4 K). If MIR emission arises from cooler, lower-density gas, extinction curves remain consistent with background starlight measurements. Conclusions: This method enables spatially resolved MIR extinction curves in embedded protostellar systems. Results suggest either a change in dust size distribution (e.g., from grain growth) or that MIR emission originates from cooler, less dense regions than NIR emission. (Abstract shortened for arXiv.

|| B. Fuhrmeister, et al. -- incl., <mark>T. Henning</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-04-04*|
|*Comments*| *15 pages, 20 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            Teegarden's star is a late-type M-dwarf planet host, typically showing only rather low levels of activity. In this paper we present an extensive characterisation of this activity at photospheric, chromospheric, and coronal levels. We specifically investigated TESS observations of Teegarden's star, which showed two very large flares with an estimated flare fluence between 10$^{29}$ and 10$^{32}$\,erg comparable to the largest solar flares. We furthermore analysed nearly 300 CARMENES spectra and 11 ESPRESSO spectra covering all the usually used chromospheric lines in the optical from the \ion{Ca}{ii} H \& K lines at 3930\,Å\, to the \ion{He}{i} infrared triplet at 10830\,Å. These lines show different behaviour: The \ion{He}{i} infrared triplet is the only one absent in all spectra, some lines show up only during flares, and others are always present and highly variable. Specifically, the H$\alpha$ line is more or less filled in during quiescence; however, the higher Balmer lines are still observed in emission. Many chromospheric lines show a correlation with H$\alpha$ variability, which, in addition to stochastic behaviour, also shows systematic behaviour on different timescales including the rotation period. Moreover, we found several flares and also report hints of an erupting prominence, which may have led to a coronal mass ejection. Finally, we present X-ray observations of Teegarden's star (i.e. a discovery pointing obtained with the \emph{Chandra} observatory) and an extensive study with the \emph{XMM-Newton} observatory; when these two large flares were observed, one of them showed clear signatures of the Neupert effect, suggesting the production of hard X-rays in the system.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the first observations of a novel dipole signature imprinted on the CMB by transverse velocities. Cosmological peculiar velocities point towards gravitational wells and away from potential hills, reflecting a large-scale dipole in the gravitational potential, coherent over hundreds of Mpc. We predict large-scale dipoles in all fields correlated with the potential, observable via effects of gravitational lensing and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW). The ISW dipole is distinct from the small-scale moving lens effect, which has a dipole of the opposite sign. We provide a unified framework for analysing these dipoles, and make the first detections in galaxy density, CMB lensing convergence and the ISW effect. We show that the observed signals are consistent with LCDM predictions, and set limits on modified gravity. The CMB dipole signal is independent of galaxy bias, and orthogonal to the monopole correlation function, so this new observable provides additional cosmological information (abridged).         |

|**Abstract**|            Deuteration of hydrocarbon material, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), has been proposed to account for the low gas-phase abundances of D in the interstellar medium. JWST spectra of four star-forming regions in M51 show an emission feature, with central wavelength $\sim$4.647$\mu$m and FWHM 0.0265$\mu$m, corresponding to the C-D stretching mode in aliphatic hydrocarbons. The emitting aliphatic material is estimated to have (D/H)$_{\rm aliph}\approx 0.17\pm0.02$ -- a factor $\sim$$10^4$ enrichment relative to the overall interstellar medium (ISM). On $\sim$$50\,$pc scales, deuteration levels toward four H$\,$II regions in M51 are 2-3 times higher than in the Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR), with implications for the processes responsible for the formation and evolution of hydrocarbon nanoparticles, including PAHs. The deuteration of the aliphatic material is found to anticorrelate with helium ionization in the associated H$\,$II, suggesting that harsh FUV radiation may act to lower the deuteration of aliphatics in PDRs near massive stars. No evidence is found for deuteration of aromatic material, with (D/H)$_{\rm arom} \lesssim 0.016$: deuteration of the aliphatic material exceeds that of the aromatic material by at least a factor 10. The observed levels of deuteration may account for the depletion of D observed in the Galactic interstellar medium. If so, the $4.65\mu$m feature may be detectable in absorption.         |

|**Abstract**|            We conducted targeted fast radio burst (FRB) and pulsar searches on eight pulsing ultraluminous X-ray sources (PULXs) using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) and the Parkes 64-meter Radio Telescope (Murriyang) to investigate whether PULXs could be progenitors of FRBs. FAST carried out 12 observations of four PULXs, totaling 8 hours, while Parkes conducted 12 observations of the remaining four PULXs, totaling 11 hours. No significant signals were detected through single-pulse and periodic searches, covering a dispersion measure (DM) range of 0-5000 pc cm$^{-3}$, placing stringent upper limits on the radio flux density from these sources. The results imply that accretion processes and dense stellar winds in PULXs likely suppress or attenuate potential coherent emission in radio band. Additionally, the beaming factor and luminosity of FRBs associated with PULXs, as well as the highly relativistic and magnetized nature of their outflows, may limit detectability. Non-detection yielded from the observations covering the full orbital phases of PULXs can also constrain the theoretical models that link FRB emission to highly magnetized neutron stars in binary systems.         |

|**Abstract**|            Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in the Balmer continuum of solar white-light flares (WLFs) are rarely reported, and accurately pinpointing the spatial source of flaring QPPs remains a significant challenge. We present spatiotemporal characteristics of QPPs of an X2.8 two-ribbon solar WLF (SOL2023-12-14T17:02), which was well observed by the White-light Solar Telescope (WST) aboard the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory, with high-cadence imaging (1--2 s) in the Balmer continuum at 3600 Å. Combined with additional multi-instrument data, we find that the enhancement of the WLF in both Balmer and Paschen continua shows strong spatiotemporal correlation with hard X-ray (HXR) emissions. Notably, the pulses in the WST Balmer continuum exhibited a near-zero time lag with most HXR pulses, whereas soft X-ray and extreme ultraviolet emissions showed a lag of 2--3 s. Interestingly, quasi-harmonic QPPs with periods of $\sim$11 s and $\sim$20 s were observed in multiple wavelengths in the rising phase of the white-light continuum. Furthermore, we employed Fourier transform to spatially locate the QPPs around 11 and 20 s, revealing that they primarily originated from the east flare ribbon, which exhibited the most substantial continuum enhancement. More interestingly, we find that the west ribbon contributed significantly to the 11-second QPP but had a weaker contribution to the 20-second QPP. Moreover, the occurrence of quasi-harmonic QPPs is temporally coincident with the rapid elongation and separation motions of flare ribbons. Possible mechanisms for the quasi-harmonic QPPs have been discussed. These observations provide valuable insights into QPP modeling for solar and stellar flares.         |

|**Abstract**|            There has been growing evidence that the rich star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds contain significant fractions of rapidly rotating stars. In this work, we aim to constrain these fractions by studying the colour-magnitude diagrams of four star clusters, selected among those with the most striking signatures of fast rotators. Using isochrones derived from PARSEC v2.0 stellar tracks, we generate distinct stellar populations, each covering a limited interval of initial rotation rates $\omega_\mathrm{i}$, referred to as 'Partial Models' (PMs). Using optimization algorithms and Monte Carlo Markov Chains, PMs are combined to create the final best-fitting model. In our analysis, we adopt two key assumptions: a uniform age and an isotropic distribution of stellar spin axes within each cluster. The solutions are allowed to explore the entire range of $\omega_\mathrm{i}$, and different values of age, metallicity, distance and foreground extinction. We find that the rotational velocity distributions in all four clusters reveal a high fraction of stars with $\omega_\mathrm{i}$ close to the break-up value, in all cases. Specifically, the fraction of stars with $\omega_\mathrm{i}>0.7$ exceeds $80\%$ in the clusters NGC 419 of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and NGC 1831 and NGC 1866 of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). For NGC 2203 of the LMC, this fraction is smaller, although it still exceeds $50\%$, confirming that also this cluster is mainly populated by fast-rotating stars.         |

|**Abstract**|            Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) regulate the evolution of their host galaxies through powerful outflows and multi-phase feedback. This process plays a crucial role in shaping SMBH-galaxy co-evolution across cosmic time, but direct evidence linking nuclear winds to large-scale cold gas outflows, particularly in high-redshift quasars, has remained elusive. Here we present statistical evidence of a connection between nuclear winds and large-scale cold gas outflows in quasars at $z \sim 5.5$. Using stacked [C II] 158 $\mu$m emission profiles from ALMA observations, which trace galactic-scale neutral gas, we compare broad absorption line (BAL) quasars -- tracing parsec- to sub-kiloparsec-scale nuclear winds -- with non-BAL quasars. The BAL stack reveals a significant (S/N=4.45) broad component in the [C II] emission, indicating high-velocity neutral gas outflows with a velocity offset of $\Delta v_{\rm b} = -2.1 \times 10^2 \, \rm km\,s^{-1}$ and a full width at half maximum of $1.18 \times 10^3 \, \rm km\,s^{-1}$, while the non-BAL stack shows no such feature. We estimate that a few percent up to one-quarter of the BAL wind energy is transferred to neutral gas on kiloparsec scales. These findings provide direct observational evidence that nuclear winds couple with galactic-scale neutral gas flows, supporting multi-phase AGN feedback models. This mechanism may contribute to explaining the diversity of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*$ ratios observed in some luminous AGN recently observed by JWST, compared to the Magorrian relation.         |

|| Q. Li, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-04-04*|

|**Abstract**|            Mass ($M$) and luminosity ($L$) are fundamental parameters of stars but can only be measured indirectly. Typically, effective temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$), surface gravity (${\rm log}\ g$) and metallicity ([M/H]) are derived from stellar spectra, then $M$, $L$ and stellar age ($t$) can be obtained by interpolating in the grid of stellar evolutionary models. In this paper, we use the Random Forest (RF) in combination with the evolutionary grid from PARSEC 1.2S to determine $M$, $L$, $t$ and initial mass ($M_{\rm i}$) for early-type main-sequence stars ($T_{\rm eff}\geq 7,000\ {\rm K}$) as identified from the LAMOST survey. The convex hull algorithm is employed to select the main-sequence stars. The results demonstrate that the prediction precision is $32\%$ and $9\%$ for $L$ and $M$, respectively, which is comparable to that achieved by fitting evolutionary tracks. Furthermore, the predicted $L$ also aligns with Gaia's observations, with a relative difference of $36\%$. The prediction for $t$ is relatively less accurate, indicating a difference of 0.44 Gyr for two components in wide binaries. This discrepancy is due to the inconsistent metallicity measurements. For the two sets of atmospheric parameters we used, the relative differences in $L$, $M$, $t$ and $M_{\rm i}$ are $29\%$, $7\%$, $36\%$ and $7\%$, respectively. The influence of metallicity on these parameters is analyzed, with the conclusion that metallicity has the greatest impact on $t$. Consequently, two catalogs are presented, which would be useful for studying stellar populations such as the luminosity function and initial mass function of early-type stars.         |
