|**Abstract**|            Using a model-independent Gaussian process (GP) method to reconstruct the dimensionless luminosity distance $D$ and its derivatives, we derive the evolution of the dimensionless Hubble parameter $E$, the deceleration parameter $q$, and the state parameter $w$ of dark energy. We utilize the PantheonPlus, SH0ES, and Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) data to derive the dimensionless luminosity distance $D$. Additionally, we employ observational $H(z)$ data (OHD) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) to obtain the first derivative of the dimensionless luminosity distance $D^{'}$. To obtain the reconstructed $D$ and $D^{'}$, we utilize the fiducial value from each dataset, with particular emphasis on the varying $H_0$. According to the reconstruction results obtained from PantheonPlus+SH0ES+GRB+OHD and PantheonPlus+SH0ES+GRB+OHD+DESI data, we find that $E$ are consistent with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model at a $2\sigma$ confidence level within the redshift range of $z<2$. However, the reconstruction results for $q$ exhibit deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model in the range of $z<0.3$. Furthermore, we observe that the mean value of $w$ exhibits evolving behavior, transiting from $w < -1$ to $w > -1$ around $z_{\rm wt}=0.464^{+0.235}_{-0.120}$. Combining data from DESI DR2 can slightly enhance the accuracy of our constraints.         |

|| S. He, et al. -- incl., <mark>M. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-11-05*|
|*Comments*| *23 pages, 15 figures. Accepted for publication in ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            We analyze the hierarchical structure in the Rosette Molecular Cloud (RMC) using $^{13}$CO J=1-0 data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey with a non-binary Dendrogram algorithm that allows multiple branches to emerge from parent structures. A total of 588 substructures are identified, including 458 leaves and 130 branches. The physical parameters of the substructures, including peak brightness temperature ($T_{\rm peak}$), brightness temperature difference ($T_{\rm diff}$), radius ($R$), mass ($M$), velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$), and surface density ($\Sigma$), are characterized. The $T_{\rm peak}$ and $T_{\rm diff}$ distributions follow exponential functions with characteristic values above $5\sigma_{\rm RMS}$. The statistical properties and scaling relations, i.e., $\sigma_v$-$R$, $M$-$R$, and $\sigma_v$-$R\Sigma$ relations are in general consistent with those from traditional segmentation methods. The mass and radius follow power-law distributions with exponents of 2.2-2.5, with slightly flatter slopes for substructures inside the HII region. The velocity dispersion scales weakly with radius ($\sigma_v \propto R^{0.45\pm 0.03}$, $r = 0.58$), but shows a tighter correlation with the product of surface density and size ($\sigma_v \propto (\Sigma R)^{0.29\pm 0.01}$, $r = 0.73$). Self-gravitating substructures are found across scales from $\sim$0.2 to 10 pc, and nearly all structures with peak brightness above 4 K are gravitationally bound ($\alpha_{\rm vir} < 2$). The fraction of bound structures increases with mass, size, and surface density, supporting the scenario of global hierarchical collapse (GHC) for the evolution of molecular clouds, in which molecular clouds and their substructures are undergoing multiscale collapse.         |

|**Abstract**|            Evidence suggests that protostellar outbursts likely play a critical role in the stellar mass assembly process, but the extent of this contribution is not well understood. Using the proposed observing program of PRIMA, a concept far-IR observatory (PRIMA GO Case #43 in Moullet et al. 2023), we examine the probe's ability to unambiguously determine whether or not variable accretion events dominate the stellar mass assembly process ($M_{\rm burst}\geq0.5M_{*}$). To do this, we construct multiple protostellar ensembles using Herschel 70$\mu$m flux data and evolve them using a toy Monte Carlo simulation through steady-state and high magnitude accretion events. Ensembles are observed at various epochs in the evolution process to conclude how many large amplitude outbursts are observationally recoverable during the proposed program. Based on our synthetic observations and our simulation specifications, we determine that observing a protostellar ensemble of at least 2000 protostars using PRIMA's proposed program is sufficient for determining the importance of protostellar outbursts in the stellar mass assembly process.         |
