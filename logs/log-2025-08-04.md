|**Abstract**|            Powered by supermassive black holes at their centers, quasars are among the most luminous objects in the Universe, serving as important probes of cosmic history and galaxy evolution. The size of the accretion disc surrounding the black hole is a critical parameter for understanding quasar physics and their potential use as standard candles in cosmology. However, direct measurements of accretion disc sizes have so far been confined to the Local Universe ($z<0.2$), limiting our understanding of quasars during the peak of cosmic activity. Here, we report the first direct measurement of the accretion disc size in the quasar QSO J0455-4216 at $z=2.66$, when the Universe was only $\sim2$ Gyrs old. Medium-band filters mounted on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at La Silla Observatory were used to isolate continuum emission regions during a six-month monitoring campaign. The light curves exhibit pronounced variability features and enabled the detection of inter-band time delays from different parts of the disc. We mapped the disc and located its ultraviolet-emitting outermost region at $3.02^{+0.33}_{-0.57}$ light-days from the black hole ($\sim 500$ AU). Given a supermassive black hole 900 million times the mass of the Sun, these measurements validate accretion disc theory at an unprecedented redshift and pave the way for efficient black hole mass estimates, reducing decades-long spectroscopic reverberation campaigns to just a few years or less.         |

|| S. L. Nickerson, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            We present the first astrophysical detection of methanol (CH3OH) in the torsional band near 25 um. Using high resolution mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy, we identified over seventy gas-phase CH3OH absorption lines between 20 and 28 um towards the massive protostar NGC 7538 IRS 1 with SOFIA/EXES. We derive a temperature of 180 K and a total column density of 2 x 10^17 cm-2, comparable to sub-mm measurements. Complementary analysis of acetylene (C2H2) absorption lines is also included. Both CH3OH and C2H2 reveal an unresolved second velocity component. These MIR absorption lines likely probe the molecular material in two edge-on disks, supporting the scenario that NGC 7538 IRS 1 consists of multiple protostars. We provide an updated line list for the torsional band of CH3OH, which was generated from lab work and model calculations. This discovery and the updated line list will enable the search for CH3OH in JWST/MIRI spectra.         |

|| X. Li, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Shi</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2025-08-04*|
|*Comments*| *Accepted by ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            A subset of low-mass giants ($<2.2\,M_{\odot}$) exhibit anomalous lithium enhancement behavior, which is still an open topic. Given that more massive giants retain more surface lithium, increasing mass by accreting circumstellar matter could be a channel to enrich lithium. We evaluate this process in the current work. Using MESA, we construct a model of matter accretion, including mass loss, that evolves a star from the main sequence turnoff to the red giant branch tip. The mean accretion rate is estimated from the upper limit of the accreted mass and the evolutionary time of the star during this period, and a grid of accretion rates is constructed. We separately consider their effects on the lithium enhancement of giants, both in terms of the mass and the composition of accretion. Accreting matter with higher lithium abundances has a promoting effect on the lithium enhancement of giants. The accreted matter with excess lithium alleviates the dilution of lithium in the convective envelope during the first dredge-up. The added mass results in lower temperatures at the bottom of the convective envelope, which likewise weakens the depletion of surface lithium. Weak accretion of circumstellar matter is a possible route to lithium enhancement for giants, and it predicts an upper limit on the lithium abundance of $\rm \sim 2.5\,dex$. However, the mass increment it requires poses a potential challenge to real astrophysical environments. Such accretion suppresses lithium dilution and depletion of the star during the first dredge-up, thus exhibiting lithium enhancement behavior.         |

|| Y.-H. Zhao, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            The progenitors of Type II-P supernovae (SNe) are generally considered to be red supergiants; however, the so-called "red supergiant problem" indicates that a deeper investigation into the progenitors of this class of SNe is necessary. SN 2009ib and SN 2012ec are two Type II-P SNe for which progenitor candidates have been identified in pre-explosion images. In this work, we use new, late-time Hubble Space Telescope observations to search for the disappearance of these two candidates and confirm their nature. In the case of SN 2009ib, the late-time high-resolution imaging reveals that the progenitor candidate is in fact a blend of multiple unresolved stars. Subsequent difference imaging shows no significant change in brightness at the SN's position even years after the explosion. These findings indicate that the flux from the previously identified source is dominated by unresolved field stars, with little to no contribution from the genuine progenitor. In the case of SN 2012ec, a comparison of pre-explosion and late-time images reveals that the progenitor candidate faded by about 0.6 mag in the F814W band seven years after the explosion, confirming the disappearance of the progenitor.         |

|**Abstract**|            Double-peaked \oiii~profiles could potentially indicate kiloparsec-scale dual AGNs. We analyze long-term optical light curves of 35 type 1 AGNs with such features from our recent catalog in Zheng et al. (2025). These light curves are obtained from the Catalina Sky Survey and modeled using a Damped Random Walk (DRW) process. A control sample of 210 normal type 1 AGNs matched in redshift, intrinsic luminosity, and black hole mass is also studied. If the double-peaked \oiii~are caused by two type 1 AGNs (dual type 1 AGN), then the combined variability from the two AGNs would be expected to differ from that of a single type 1 AGN. However, there is no statistically significant difference in the variability timescale $\tau$ and intrinsic variability amplitude $\sigma$ between these double-peaked AGNs and the control sample of 210 normal type 1 AGNs. Crucially, computer simulations reveal that dual AGN systems systematically produce lower variability amplitudes than single AGNs, which is inconsistent with the observed variability properties of our double-peaked \oiii~sample. Moreover, simulations suggest that the fraction of dual type 1 AGNs is $\sim$ 3\%, indicating that double-peaked \oiii~may not be a reliable indicator of dual type 1 AGNs in these systems. However, this does not rule out the possibility that some objects may still host dual AGNs involving other combinations, such as type 1+type 2 AGNs. Future studies with larger samples and higher-quality light curves will help clarify the true nature of these systems.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a catalog of 8545 and 19,257 unique DA white dwarfs observed in SDSS Data Release 19 and previous SDSS data releases, respectively. This is the largest catalog of both spectroscopic and photometric measurements of DA white dwarfs available to date, and we make this catalog and all code used to create it publicly available. We measure the apparent radial velocity, spectroscopic effective temperature and surface gravity, and photometric effective temperature and radius for all objects in our catalog. We validate our measurements against other published white dwarf catalogs. For apparent radial velocities, surface gravities, and effective temperatures measured from spectra with signal-to-noise ratios $>50$, our measurements agree with published SDSS white dwarf catalogs to within 7.5 km/s, 0.060 dex, and $2.4\%$, respectively. For radii and effective temperatures measured with Gaia photometry, our measurements agree with other published Gaia datasets to within $0.0005$ $R_\odot$ and $3\%$, respectively. We use this catalog to investigate systematic discrepancies between white dwarfs observed in SDSS-V and previous generations of SDSS. For objects observed in both SDSS-V and previous generations, we uncover systematic differences between measured spectroscopic parameters depending on which set of survey data is used. On average, the measured apparent radial velocity of a DA white dwarf is $11.5$ km/s larger and the surface gravity is $0.015$ dex smaller when a white dwarf's spectroscopic parameters are measured using SDSS-V data compared to using data from previous generations of SDSS. These differences may be due to changes in the wavelength solution across survey generations.         |
