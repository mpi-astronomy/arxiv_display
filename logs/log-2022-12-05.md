|**Abstract**| The majority of the Milky Way's stellar halo consists of debris from our Galaxy's last major merger, the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE). In the past few years, stars from GSE have been kinematically and chemically studied in the inner $30$ kpc of our Galaxy. However, simulations predict that accreted debris could lie at greater distances, forming substructures in the outer halo. Here we derive metallicities and distances using Gaia DR3 XP spectra for an all-sky sample of luminous red giant stars, and map the outer halo with kinematics and metallicities out to $100$ kpc. We obtain follow-up spectra of stars in two strong overdensities - including the previously identified Outer Virgo Overdensity - and find them to be relatively metal-rich and on predominantly retrograde orbits, matching predictions from simulations of the GSE merger. We argue that these are apocentric shells of GSE debris, forming $60-90$ kpc counterparts to the $15-20$ kpc shells that are known to dominate the inner stellar halo. Extending our search across the sky with literature radial velocities, we find evidence for a coherent stream of retrograde stars encircling the Milky Way from $50-100$ kpc, in the same plane as the Sagittarius stream but moving in the opposite direction. These are the first discoveries of distant and structured imprints from the GSE merger, cementing the picture of an inclined and retrograde collision that built up our Galaxy's stellar halo. |

|**Abstract**| The first JWST observations of nearby galaxies have unveiled a rich population of bubbles that trace the stellar feedback mechanisms responsible for their creation. Studying these bubbles therefore allows us to chart the interaction between stellar feedback and the interstellar medium, and the larger galactic flows needed to regulate star formation processes globally. We present the first catalog of bubbles in NGC628, visually identified using MIRI F770W PHANGS-JWST observations, and use them to statistically evaluate bubble characteristics. We classify 1694 structures as bubbles with radii between 6-552 pc. Of these, 31% contain at least one smaller bubble at their edge, indicating that previous generations of star formation have a local impact on where new stars form. On large scales, most bubbles lie near a spiral arm, and their radii increase downstream compared to upstream. Furthermore, bubbles are elongated in a similar direction to the spiral arm ridge-line. These azimuthal trends demonstrate that star formation is intimately connected to the spiral arm passage. Finally, the bubble size distribution follows a power-law of index $p=-2.2\pm0.1$, which is slightly shallower than the theoretical value by 1-3.5$\sigma$ that did not include bubble mergers. The fraction of bubbles identified within the shells of larger bubbles suggests that bubble merging is a common process. Our analysis therefore allows us to quantify the number of star-forming regions that are influenced by an earlier generation, and the role feedback processes have in setting the global star formation rate. With the full PHANGS-JWST sample, we can do this for more galaxies. |

|**Abstract**| We present a high-resolution view of bubbles within The Phantom Galaxy (NGC 628); a nearby (~10Mpc), star-forming (~2Msun/yr), face-on (i~9deg) grand-design spiral galaxy. With new data obtained as part of the PHANGS-JWST treasury program, we perform a detailed case-study of two regions of interest, one of which contains the largest and most prominent bubble in the galaxy (The Phantom Void; over 1kpc in diameter), and the other being a smaller region that may be the precursor to such a large bubble (The Precursor Phantom Void). When comparing to matched resolution Halpha observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we see that the ionized gas is brightest in the shells of both bubbles, and is coincident with the youngest (~1Myr) and most massive (~100,000Msun) stellar associations. We also find an older generation (~20Myr) of stellar associations is present within the bubble of The Phantom Void. From our kinematic analysis of the HI, H2 (CO) and HII gas across The Phantom Void, we infer a high expansion speed of around 15 to 50km/s. The large size and high expansion speed of The Phantom Void suggest that the driving mechanism is sustained stellar feedback due to multiple mechanisms, where early feedback first cleared a bubble (as we observe now in The Precursor Phantom Void), and since then SNe have been exploding within the cavity, and have accelerated the shell. Finally, comparison to simulations shows a striking resemblance to our JWST observations, and suggests that such large-scale stellar feedback-driven bubbles should be common within other galaxies. |

|| <mark>Riccardo Franceschi</mark>, Steven Neil Shore |
|*Appeared on*| *2022-12-05*|
|*Comments*| *8 pages, 13 figures*|
|**Abstract**| We investigate the ionization of the diffuse interstellar medium by cosmic rays by modeling their propagation along the wandering magnetic fields using a Monte Carlo method. We study how low-energy cosmic rays propagate in turbulent, translucent molecular clouds, and how they regulate the ionization and both lose and gain energy from the medium. As a test case, we use high spatial resolution (0.03 pc) CO maps of a well-studied high latitude translucent cloud, MBM 3, to model turbulence. The propagation problem is solved with a modified Monte Carlo procedure that includes trapping, energization, and ionization losses. In a homogeneous medium, trapping and re-energization do not produce a significant effect. In a nonuniform medium, particles can be trapped for a long time inside the cloud. This modifies the cosmic ray distribution due to stochastic acceleration at the highest energies (about 100 MeV). At lower energies, the re-energization is too weak to produce an appreciable effect. The change in the energy distribution does not significantly affect the ionization losses, so ionization changes are due to trapping effects. |

|**Abstract**| Observations of protoplanetary disks provide information on planet formation and the reasons for the diversity of planetary systems. The key to understanding planet formation is the study of dust evolution from small grains to pebbles. Smaller grains are well-coupled to the gas dynamics, and their distribution is significantly extended above the disk midplane. Larger grains settle much faster and are efficiently formed only in the midplane. By combining near-infrared polarized light and millimeter observations, it is possible to constrain the spatial distribution of both the small and large grains. We aim to construct detailed models of the size distribution and vertical/radial structure of the dust particles in protoplanetary disks based on observational data. In particular, we are interested in recovering the dust distribution in the IM Lup protoplanetary disk. We create a physical model for the dust distribution of protoplanetary disks and simulate the radiative transfer of the millimeter continuum and the near-infrared polarized radiation. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, we compare the derived images to the observations available for the IM Lup disk to constrain the best physical model for IM Lup and to recover the vertical grain size distribution. The millimeter and near-infrared emission tightly constrain the dust mass and grain size distribution of our model. We find size segregation in the dust distribution, with millimeter-sized grains in the disk midplane. These grains are efficiently formed in the disk, possibly by sedimentation-driven coagulation, in accord with the short settling timescales predicted by our model. This also suggests a high dust-to-gas ratio at smaller radii in the midplane, possibly triggering streaming instabilities and planetesimal formation in the inner disk. |

|**Abstract**| The ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Reticulum II (Ret II) exhibits a unique chemical evolution history, with 72 +10/-12% of its stars strongly enhanced in r-process elements. We present deep Hubble Space Telescope photometry of Ret II and analyze its star formation history. As in other ultra-faint dwarfs, the color-magnitude diagram is best fit by a model consisting of two bursts of star formation. If we assume that the bursts were instantaneous, then the older burst occurred around the epoch of reionization and formed ~80% of the stars in the galaxy, while the remainder of the stars formed ~3 Gyr later. When the bursts are allowed to have nonzero durations we obtain slightly better fits. The best-fitting model in this case consists of two bursts beginning before reionization, with approximately half the stars formed in a short (100 Myr) burst and the other half in a more extended period lasting 2.6 Gyr. Considering the full set of viable star formation history models, we find that 28% of the stars formed within 500 +/- 200 Myr of the onset of star formation. The combination of the star formation history and the prevalence of r-process-enhanced stars demonstrates that the r-process elements in Ret II must have been synthesized early in its initial star-forming phase. We therefore constrain the delay time between the formation of the first stars in Ret II and the r-process nucleosynthesis to be less than 500 Myr. This measurement rules out an r-process source with a delay time of several Gyr or more such as GW170817. |

|**Abstract**| We model substructure in the protoplanetary disks around DoAr 44 and HD 163296 in order to better understand the conditions under which planets may form. We match archival millimeter-wavelength thermal emission against models of the disks' structure that are in radiation balance with the starlight heating and in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium, and then compare to archival polarized scattered near-infrared images of the disks. The millimeter emission arises in the interior, while the scattered near-infrared radiation probes the disks' outer layers. Our best model of the HD 163296 disk has dust masses $81\pm 13$ $M_\oplus$ in the inner ring at 68 au and $82^{+26}_{-16}$ $M_\oplus$ in the outer ring at 102 au, both falling within the range of estimates from previous studies. Our DoAr 44 model has total dust mass $84^{+7.0}_{-3.5}$ $M_\oplus$. Unlike HD 163296, DoAr 44 as of yet has no detected planets. If the central cavity in the DoAr 44 disk is caused by a planet, the planet's mass must be at least 0.5 $M_J$ and is unlikely to be greater than 1.6 $M_J$. We demonstrate that the DoAr 44 disk's structure with a bright ring offset within a fainter skirt can be formed by dust particles drifting through a plausible distribution of gas. |

|**Abstract**| The butterfly diagram of the solar cycle is the equatorward migration of the emergence latitudes of sunspots as the solar cycle evolves. Revealing the mechanism for the butterfly diagram is essential for understanding the solar and stellar dynamo. The equatorward meridional flow at the base of the convection zone (CZ) was believed to be responsible for the butterfly diagram. However, helioseismological studies indicate controversial forms of the flow, and even present poleward flow at the base of the CZ, which poses a big challenge to the widely accepted mechanism. This motivates us to propose a new mechanism in this study. Using a data-driven Babcock-Leighton-type dynamo model, we carry out numerical simulations to explore how the latitude-dependent radial flux transport affects the latitudinal migration of the toroidal field, under different meridional flow profiles. The results indicate that when the radial transport of the poloidal field at higher latitudes is sufficiently faster, the toroidal fields of a new cycle at higher latitudes are generated earlier than that at lower latitudes, and vice versa. Thus, the butterfly diagram is suggested to correspond to the time- and latitude-dependent regeneration of the toroidal field due to the latitude-dependent radial transport of the poloidal flux. |

|**Abstract**| The identification and localization of Fast Radio Bursts to their host galaxies has revealed important details about the progenitors of these mysterious, millisecond-long bursts of coherent radio emission. In this work we study the most probable host galaxy of the apparently non-repeating CHIME/FRB event FRB 20190425A -- a particularly high luminosity, low dispersion measure event that was demonstrated by Moroianu et al. 2022 to be temporally and spatially coincident with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binary neutron star merger GW190425, suggesting an astrophysical association (p-value 0.0052). In this paper we remain agnostic to this result, and we confirm UGC10667 as the most probable host galaxy of FRB 20190425A, demonstrating that the host galaxies of low dispersion measure, one-off CHIME FRBs can be plausibly identified. We then perform multi-wavelength observations to characterize the galaxy and search for any afterglow emission associated with the FRB and its putative GW counterpart. We find no radio or optical transient emission in our observations $2.5\,\mathrm{yr}$ post-burst. UGC10667 is a spiral galaxy at $z\sim0.03$, dominated by an old stellar population. We find no evidence of a large population of young stars, with nebular emission dominated by star formation at a rate of $1-2\,\mathrm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$. While we cannot rule out a young magnetar as the origin of FRB 20190425A, our observations are consistent with an origin in a long delay-time neutron star binary merger as posited by Moroianu et al. 2022. |

|**Abstract**| Future launches are projected to significantly increase both the number of active satellites and aggregate collision risk in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). In this paper, a dynamical systems theory approach is used to analyze the effect of launch rate distribution on the stability of the LEO environment. A multi-shell, three-species source-sink model of the LEO environment, referred to as MOCAT-3 for MIT Orbital Capacity Assessment Tool 3 Species, is used to study the evolution of the species populations. The three species included in the model are active satellites, derelict satellites, and debris. The model's coefficients represent atmospheric drag, collision rate, mean satellite lifetime, post-mission disposal probability, and active debris removal rate. Solutions of the system of differential equations are computed, and an analysis of the stability of the equilibrium points is conducted for numerous launch rate distributions. The stability of the equilibrium points is used to test the sensitivity of the environment to run-away debris growth, known as Kessler syndrome, that occurs at the instability threshold. An analysis of the environment's response to perturbations in launch rate and debris population is conducted. The maximum perturbation in the debris population from the equilibrium state, for which the system remains in a stable configuration, is calculated. Plots of the phase space about the equilibrium points are generated. The results will help to better understand the orbital capacity of LEO and the stability of the space environment, as well as provide improved guidelines on future launch plans to avoid detrimental congestion of LEO. |

|**Abstract**| We report the results of broadband timing and spectral analysis of data from an AstroSat observation of the High Mass X-ray binary LMC X$-$4. The Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter (LAXPC) and Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) instruments on-board the AstroSat observed the source in August 2016. A complete X-ray eclipse was detected with the LAXPC. The 3$-$40 keV power density spectrum showed the presence of coherent pulsations along with a $\sim 26$ mHz quasi-periodic oscillation feature. The spectral properties of LMC X$-$4 were derived from a joint analysis of the SXT and LAXPC spectral data. The 0.5$-$25 keV persistent spectrum comprised of an absorbed high energy cutoff power law with photon index of $\Gamma \sim$ 0.8 and cutoff at $\sim$16 keV, a soft thermal component with kT$_{BB} \sim$ 0.14 keV and Gaussian components corresponding to Fe K$_\alpha$, Ne \textsc{ix} and Ne \textsc{x} emission lines. Assuming a source distance of 50 kpc, we determined 0.5--25 keV luminosity to be $\sim 2 \times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. |

|**Abstract**| Isotropic diffuse gamma-ray flux in the PeV energy band is an important tool for multimessenger tests of models of the origin of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos and for new-physics searches. So far, this flux has not yet been observed. Carpet-2 is an air-shower experiment capable of detecting astrophysical gamma rays with energies above 0.1 PeV. Here we report the upper limits on the isotropic gamma-ray flux from Carpet-2 data obtained in 1999-2011 and 2018-2022. These results, obtained with the new statistical method based on the shape of the muon-number distribution, summarize Carpet-2 observations as the upgraded installation, Carpet-3, starts its operation. |

|**Abstract**| On August 17, 2017, Advanced LIGO and Virgo observed GW170817, the first gravitational-wave (GW) signal from a binary neutron star merger. It was followed by a short-duration gamma-ray burst, GRB 170817A, and by a non-thermal afterglow emission. In this work, a combined simultaneous fit of the electromagnetic (EM, specifically, afterglow) and GW domains is implemented, both using the posterior distribution of a GW standalone analysis as prior distribution to separately process the EM data, and fitting the EM and GW domains simultaneously. These approaches coincide mathematically, as long as the actual posterior of the GW analysis, and not an approximation, is used as prior for the EM analysis. We treat the viewing angle, $\theta_v$, as shared parameter across the two domains. In the afterglow modelling this parameter and the jet core angle, $\theta_c$, are correlated, leading to high uncertainties on their values. The joint EM+GW analysis relaxes this degeneracy, reducing the uncertainty compared to an EM-only fit. We also apply our methodology to a hypothetical GW170817-like event occurring in the next GW observing run at $\sim$140 Mpc, so that the afterglow flux is one order of magnitude fainter, leaving only the light curve peak visible. The EM-only fit cannot constrain $\theta_v$ nor $\theta_c$, while folding the GW data into the analysis leads to tighter constraints on $\theta_v$. Although the geometry of the jet remains unconstrained because of the lack of data in the afterglow rising phase, in all fits the jet total width results to be smaller than $\theta_v$ (off-axis case). |

|**Abstract**| Star formation can produce bubbles and outflows, as a result of stellar feedback. Outflows and bubbles inject momentum and energy into the surrounding interstellar medium, and so are related to the overall energy balance of the molecular cloud. Molecular bubbles can be resolved by higher-resolution radio telescopes to quantify the effect of star formation on molecular clouds. We report here the identification of a new molecular bubble with an outflow, and an Herbig Haro object, HH319, located at the bubble center. Multi-wavelength data have been utilized to study its spatial structure, energy injection, and dynamical timescale. This bubble has a kinetic energy of $\rm 5.8 \times 10^{43}$ erg within the smallest radius of a bubble in Taurus, 0.077 pc. The bubble formed $\sim$70,000 years ago. According to the proper motion velocities of protostars from $Gaia$ EDR3, the T Tauri binary stars (FY Tau and FZ Tau) at the southwest edge of the bubble may have produced the outflow-bubble structure. This is an unusual new structure found in low- and intermediate-mass star formation regions. Only a bubble in Orion A, driven by V380 Ori, has a similar structure. The bubble-outflow structure provides additional observational evidence for the theory of stellar wind from T Tauri stars. It enhances our understanding of how stellar feedback acts on molecular clouds. |

|**Abstract**| Physics-based solar cycle predictions provide an effective way to verify our understanding of the solar cycle. Before the start of cycle 25, several physics-based solar cycle predictions were developed. These predictions use flux transport dynamo (FTD) models, surface flux transport (SFT) models, or a combination of the two kinds of models. The common physics behind these predictions is that the surface poloidal fields around cycle minimum dominate the subsequent cycle strength. In the review, we first give short introductions to SFT and FTD models. Then we compare 7 physics-based prediction models from 4 aspects, which are what the predictor is, how to get the predictor, how to use the predictor, and what to predict. Finally, we demonstrate the large effect of assimilated magnetograms on predictions by two SFT numerical tests. We suggest that uncertainties in both initial magnetograms and sunspot emergence should be included in such physics-based predictions because of their large effects on the results. In addition, in the review we put emphasis on what we can learn from different predictions, rather than an assessment of prediction results. |

|**Abstract**| Context: Outflows from low-mass star-forming galaxies are a fundamental ingredient for models of galaxy evolution and cosmology. Aims: The onset of kpc-scale ionised filaments in the halo of the metal-poor compact dwarf SBS 0335-052E was previously not linked to an outflow. We here we investigate whether these filaments provide evidence for an outflow. Methods: We obtained new VLT/MUSE WFM and deep NRAO/VLA B-configuration 21cm data of the galaxy. The MUSE data provide morphology, kinematics, and emission line ratios H$\beta$/H$\alpha$ and [\ion{O}{iii}]$\lambda5007$/H$\alpha$ of the low surface-brightness filaments, while the VLA data deliver morphology and kinematics of the neutral gas in and around the system. Both datasets are used in concert for comparisons between the ionised and the neutral phase. Results: We report the prolongation of a lacy filamentary ionised structure up to a projected distance of 16 kpc at $\mathrm{SB}_\mathrm{H\alpha} = 1.5\times10^{-18}$erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$arcsec$^{-2}$. The filaments exhibit unusual low H$\alpha$/H$\beta \approx 2.4$ and low [\ion{O}{iii}]/H$\alpha \sim 0.4 - 0.6$ typical of diffuse ionised gas. They are spectrally narrow ($\sim 20$ km s$^{-1}$) and exhibit no velocity sub-structure. The filaments extend outwards of the elongated \ion{H}{I} halo. On small scales the $N_\mathrm{HI}$ peak is offset from the main star-forming sites. Morphology and kinematics of \ion{H}{I} and \ion{H}{II} reveal how star-formation driven feedback interacts differently with the ionised and the neutral phase. Conclusions: We reason that the filaments are a large scale manifestation of star-formation driven feedback, namely limb-brightened edges of a giant outflow cone that protrudes through the halo of this gas-rich system. A simple toy model of such a conical-structure is found to be commensurable with the observations. |

|**Abstract**| Mrk 477 is the closest type-2 quasar (QSO2), at a distance of 163 Mpc. This makes it an ideal laboratory for studying the interplay between nuclear activity and star formation with a great level of detail and signal-to-noise. In this Letter we present new mid-infrared (mid-IR) imaging and spectroscopic data with an angular resolution of 0.4 arcsec (~300 pc) obtained with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) instrument CanariCam. The N-band (8-13 micron) spectrum of the central ~400 pc of the galaxy reveals [S IV]10.51 micron emission, but no 8.6 or 11.3 micron PAH features, which are commonly used as tracers of recent star formation. This is in stark contrast with the presence of a nuclear starburst with age of about 6 Myr and ~300 pc in size, as constrained from ultraviolet HST observations. Considering this, we argue that even the more resilient, neutral molecules that mainly produce the 11.3 micron PAH band are most likely being destroyed in the vicinity of the active nucleus despite the relatively large X-ray column density, of log N_H=23.5 cm^-2, and modest X-ray luminosity, of 1.5x10^43 erg/s. This highlights the importance of being cautious when using PAH features as star formation tracers in the central region of galaxies to evaluate the impact of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. |

|**Abstract**| The code FADO is the first publicly available population spectral synthesis tool that treats the contribution from ionised gas to the observed emission self-consistently. We study the impact of the nebular contribution on the determination of the star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, and consequent effect on the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) at low redshift. We applied FADO to the spectral database of the SDSS to derive the physical properties of galaxies. As a comparison, we used the data in the MPA-JHU catalogue, which contains the properties of SDSS galaxies derived without the nebular contribution. We selected a sample of SF galaxies with H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ flux measurements, and we corrected the fluxes for the nebular extinction through the Balmer decrement. We then calculated the H$\alpha$ luminosity to estimate the SFR. Then, by combining the stellar mass and SFR estimates from FADO and MPA-JHU, the SFMS was obtained. The H$\alpha$ flux estimates are similar between FADO and MPA-JHU. Because the H$\alpha$ flux was used as tracer of the SFR, FADO and MPA-JHU agree in their SFR. The stellar mass estimates are slightly higher for FADO than for MPA-JHU on average. However, considering the uncertainties, the differences are negligible. With similar SFR and stellar mass estimates, the derived SFMS is also similar between FADO and MPA-JHU. Our results show that for SDSS normal SF galaxies, the additional modelling of the nebular contribution does not affect the retrieved fluxes and consequentially also does not influence SFR estimators based on the extinction-corrected H$\alpha$ luminosity. For the stellar masses, the results point to the same conclusion. These results are a consequence of the fact that the vast majority of normal SF galaxies in the SDSS have a low nebular contribution. |

|**Abstract**| It has been pointed out in arXiv:2211.17057 that our recent (published) paper might be revised, due to an incorrect evaluation of the diffusion coefficients, $D(E)$, employed in the calculations. Unfortunately, there is no indication as to where the incorrectness might be. Here we offer the opportunity to be more specific, by providing the community with the whole description of the equations involved in the calculation of $D(E)$, which is missing in the {\tt arXiv} note. In this context, we mention that no \textit{ad hoc} parameterisation has been used in our paper. Furthermore, any assumption on the injection mechanisms is explicitly described in the paper as an input factor and is obviously part of the modelisation procedure, hence the final outcome is subject to it. Finally, we discuss in a more broad context what, in this calculation of the diffusion coefficient, we believe is the key message. |

|**Abstract**| The purpose of this work is to extend a sample of accurately modeled, benchmark-grade eclipsing binaries with accurately determined masses and radii. We select four "well-behaved" Kepler binaries, KIC2306740, KIC4076952, KIC5193386 and KIC5288543, each with at least 8 double-lined spectra from the apogee instrument that is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys III and IV, and from the Hobby-Eberly High Resolution Spectrograph. We obtain masses and radii with uncertainties of 2.5% or less for all four systems. Three of these systems have orbital periods longer than 9 days, and thus populate an under-sampled region of the parameter space for extremely well-characterized detached eclipsing binaries. We compare the derived masses and radii against MESA MIST isochrones to determine the ages of the systems. All systems were found to be coeval, showing that the results are consistent across MESA MIST and PHOEBE. |

|**Abstract**| A variety of scenarios for early-universe cosmology give rise to a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) with a broad spectrum of masses. In this paper we demonstrate that the evaporation of PBHs in such scenarios has the potential to place the universe into an extended period of "stasis" during which the abundances of matter and radiation remain absolutely constant despite cosmological expansion. This surprising phenomenon can give rise to new possibilities for early-universe dynamics and lead to distinctive signatures of the evaporation of such PBHs. |

|**Abstract**| We report the first detection of a TeV gamma-ray flux from the solar disk (6.3$\sigma$), based on 6.1 years of data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory. The 0.5--2.6 TeV spectrum is well fit by a power law, dN/dE = $A (E/1 \text{ TeV})^{-\gamma}$, with $A = (1.6 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{-12}$ TeV$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and $\gamma = -3.62 \pm 0.14$. The flux shows a strong indication of anticorrelation with solar activity. These results extend the bright, hard GeV emission from the disk observed with Fermi-LAT, seemingly due to hadronic Galactic cosmic rays showering on nuclei in the solar atmosphere. However, current theoretical models are unable to explain the details of how solar magnetic fields shape these interactions. HAWC's TeV detection thus deepens the mysteries of the solar-disk emission. |
