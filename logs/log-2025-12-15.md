|**Abstract**|            We present a novel self-consistent theoretical framework to characterize the formation, evolution, and merger sites of dynamically-formed black hole binaries, with a focus on explaining the most massive events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Our approach couples the galaxy formation model GAMESH with cluster population synthesis codes to trace the cosmic evolution of globular clusters simultaneously with mergers of massive black holes. Our reference model, which includes prescriptions for both cluster formation and disruption depending on properties of specific galaxies, accurately reproduces the observed age-mass distribution of the Milky Way globular clusters. We find that approximately 30% of the globular clusters observed in our galaxy's halo may have originated from satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. We confirm that hierarchical black hole mergers provide a significant contribution to the formation of black holes in and above the pair-instability mass gap. However, quantifying their contribution is challenging, as different population synthesis codes yield divergent results in terms of black hole mass function and merger rates. Furthermore, we characterize the host galaxies where massive black holes form in terms of their dark matter, stellar mass, and metallicity. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the merger and birth rate densities of binary black holes increase with redshift till z = 5. This cosmic evolution is a crucial signature with significant implications for future detectors like the LISA, the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, which will be capable to probe the high-redshift Universe.         |

|**Abstract**|            Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C) on Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is proposed to direct image the cool planets around nearby solar-type stars (within 40 pc). The core scientific objective of CPI-C is to conduct high-contrast directly imaging surveys of exoplanets ranging in size from Neptune-like to Jupiter-like, located at separations of 0.5 to 5 AU from their host stars, and to perform systematic spectroscopic analysis of the detected planets through high-precision multi-band photometry. CPI-C employs a step-transmission apodization technique to suppress the diffraction noises from the telescope pupil and a precise phase correction technique to eliminate the speckle noises due to imperfections of the optical surfaces. The contrast requirement is better than $10^{-8}$ at an inner working angle (IWA) of $3-4\lambda/D$, in the visible wavelength from 600 nm to 900 nm. CPI-C will be the first space-based instrument capable of directly imaging the reflection light from the cool exoplanets in the visible wavelength enabling the measurement of key physical parameters such as the effective temperature, surface gravity, radius, mass, and other key parameters. The potential observation results will significantly contribute to further understand the formation and evolution mechanisms of planets, which will also lay a solid foundation for future confirmation of the Earth-twins in the next generation space flagship missions.         |
