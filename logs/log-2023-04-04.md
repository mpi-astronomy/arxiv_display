|**Abstract**| We have analyzed the NH$_{2}$CHO, HNCO, H$_{2}$CO, and CH$_{3}$CN ($^{13}$CH$_{3}$CN) molecular lines at an angular resolution of $\sim 0.3''$ obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 toward 30 high-mass star-forming regions. The NH$_{2}$CHO emission has been detected in 23 regions, while the other species have been detected toward 29 regions. A total of 44 hot molecular cores (HMCs) have been identified using the moment 0 maps of the CH$_{3}$CN line. The fractional abundances of the four species have been derived at each HMC. In order to investigate pure chemical relationships, we have conducted a partial correlation test to exclude the effect of temperature. Strong positive correlations between NH$_{2}$CHO and HNCO ($\rho=0.89$) and between NH$_{2}$CHO and H$_{2}$CO (0.84) have been found. These strong correlations indicate their direct chemical links; dual-cyclic hydrogen addition and abstraction reactions between HNCO and NH$_{2}$CHO and gas-phase formation of NH$_{2}$CHO from H$_{2}$CO. Chemical models including these reactions can reproduce the observed abundances in our target sources. |

|**Abstract**| We present a low-dispersion period-luminosity relation (PL) based on 154 Cepheids in Messier 33 (M33) with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry from the PHATTER survey. Using high-quality ground-based light curves, we recover Cepheid phases and amplitudes for multi-epoch HST data and we perform template fitting to derive intensity-averaged mean magnitudes. HST observations in the SH0ES near-infrared Wesenheit system significantly reduce the effect of crowding relative to ground-based data, as seen in the final PL scatter of $\sigma$ = 0.11 mag. We adopt the absolute calibration of the PL based on HST observations in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and a distance derived using late-type detached eclipsing binaries to obtain a distance modulus for M33 of $\mu$ = 24.622 $\pm$ 0.030 mag (d = 840 $\pm$ 11 kpc), a best-to-date precision of 1.3%. We find very good agreement with past Cepheid-based measurements. Several TRGB estimates bracket our result while disagreeing with each other. Finally, we show that the flux contribution from star clusters hosting Cepheids in M33 does not impact the distance measurement and we find only 3.7% of the sample is located in (or nearby) young clusters. M33 offers one of the best sites for the cross-calibration of many primary distance indicators. Thus, a precise independent geometric determination of its distance would provide a valuable new anchor to measure the Hubble constant. |

|| Q. Ouyang, et al. -- incl., <mark>M. Zhai</mark> |

|**Abstract**| We report the transit observations of the ultra hot Jupiter WASP-121b using the Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph (GHTS) at the 4-meter ground-based telescope Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR), covering the wavelength range $502-900$ nm. By dividing the target and reference star into 19 spectroscopic passbands and applying differential spectrophotometry, we derive spectroscopic transit light curves and fit them using Gaussian process framework to determine transit depths for every passbands. The obtained optical transmission spectrum shows a steep increased slope toward the blue wavelength, which seems to be too steep to be accounted for by the Rayleigh scattering alone. We note that the transmission spectrum from this work and other works differ obviously from each other, which was pointed out previously by \citet{Wilson2021} as evidence for temporal atmospheric variation. We perform a free chemistry retrieval analysis on the optical transmission spectra from this work and the literature HST/WFC3 NIR spectrum. We determine TiO, VO and H$_{2}$O with abundances of $-5.95_{-0.42}^{+0.47}$ dex, $-6.72_{-1.79}^{+0.51}$ dex, and $-4.13_{-0.46}^{+0.63}$ dex, respectively. We compare the abundances of all these three molecules derived from this work and previous works, and find that they are not consistent with each other, indicating the chemical compositions of the terminator region may change over long timescales. Future multi-epoch and high-precision transit observations are required to further confirm this phenomena. We note that when combining the transmission spectra in the optical and in NIR in retrieval analysis, the abundances of V and VO, the NIR-to-optical offset and the cloud deck pressure may be coupled with each other. |
