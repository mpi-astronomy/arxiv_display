|**Abstract**|            The Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) onboard Euclid includes several optical elements in its path, which introduce artefacts into the data from non-nominal light paths. To ensure uncontaminated source photometry, these artefacts must be accurately accounted for. This paper focuses on two specific optical features in NISP's photometric data (NISP-P): ghosts caused by the telescope's dichroic beamsplitter, and the bandpass filters within the NISP fore-optics. Both ghost types exhibit a characteristic morphology and are offset from the originating stars. The offsets are well modelled using 2D polynomials, with only stars brighter than approximately 10 magnitudes in each filter producing significant ghost contributions. The masking radii for these ghosts depend on both the source-star brightness and the filter wavelength, ranging from 20 to 40 pixels. We present the final relations and models used in the near-infrared (NIR) data pipeline to mask these ghosts for Euclid's Quick Data Release (Q1).         |

|**Abstract**|            Turbulence in protoplanetary disks affects dust evolution and planetesimal formation. The vertical shear instability (VSI) is one of the candidate turbulence-driving mechanisms in the outer disk region. Since the VSI requires rapid gas cooling, dust grains in disks can influence and potentially control VSI-driven turbulence. However, VSI-driven turbulence has strong vertical motion, causing vertical dust diffusion. As a result, it remains unclear how turbulent structures and dust distributions form. We aim to clarify whether the VSI can achieve a quasi-steady dust profile under cooling rate evolution associated with turbulently diffusing dust. We also elucidate the dependence of the dust size and dust-to-gas mass ratio on the realization and persistence of the equilibrium state. We perform global two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of an axisymmetric disk to investigate how the VSI drives turbulence and maintains a balance between dust settling and diffusion. These simulations account for the dynamic interplay between dust distribution, cooling rates, and turbulence. We find that VSI mixing, dust settling, and local cooling reach an equilibrium, forming a thick dust layer with a dimensionless vertical mixing coefficient of approximately 10^{-3}. The ability of the VSI to sustain this state also depends on the dust size and dust-to-gas mass ratio. Larger grains or lower mass ratios weaken turbulence, leading to dust settling. The condition of equilibrium state existence is consistent with the prediction of the semi-analytic model presented by Fukuhara & Okuzumi (2024). Our results indicate that efficient turbulent dust mixing and efficient cooling can occur simultaneously. They also imply that turbulence in VSI-dominated disks has different intensity levels depending on the grain size. This suggests that the efficiency of dust growth can depend on the VSI in protoplanetary disks.         |

|**Abstract**|            The paper describes the objectives, design and findings of the pre-launch ground characterisation campaigns of the Euclid infrared detectors. The pixel properties, including baseline, bad pixels, quantum efficiency, inter pixel capacitance, quantum efficiency, dark current, readout noise, conversion gain, response nonlinearity, and image persistence were measured and characterised for each pixel. We describe in detail the test flow definition that allows us to derive the pixel properties and we present the data acquisition and data quality check software implemented for this purpose. We also outline the measurement protocols of all the pixel properties presented and we provide a comprehensive overview of the performance of the Euclid infrared detectors as derived after tuning the operating parameters of the detectors. The main conclusion of this work is that the performance of the infrared detectors Euclid meets the requirements. Pixels classified as non-functioning accounted for less than 0.2% of all science pixels. IPC coupling is minimal and crosstalk between adjacent pixels is less than 1% between adjacent pixels. 95% of the pixels show a QE greater than 80% across the entire spectral range of the Euclid mission. The conversion gain is approximately 0.52 ADU/e-, with a variation less than 1% between channels of the same detector. The reset noise is approximately equal to 23 ADU after reference pixels correction. The readout noise of a single frame is approximately 13 $e^-$ while the signal estimator noise is measured at 7 $e^-$ in photometric mode and 9 $e^-$ in spectroscopic acquisition mode. The deviation from linear response at signal levels up to 80 k$e^-$ is less than 5% for 95% of the pixels. Median persistence amplitudes are less than 0.3% of the signal, though persistence exhibits significant spatial variation and differences between detectors.         |

|**Abstract**|            Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous astrophysical transients, known to be associated with core collapse of massive stars or mergers of two compact objects such as two neutron stars. They are followed by multi-wavelength afterglow emission originating from the deceleration of the relativistic jets by the ambient medium. The study of after emission offers crucial insights into the physics of relativistic shocks, the properties of the circumburst environment, as well as the physical and geometrical structure of relativistic jets, as well as the viewing geometry of the observer. We present VegasAfterglow, a newly developed, high-performance C++ framework designed for modeling GRB afterglows with flexibility and computational efficiency as keynotes of design. The framework self-consistently solves forward and reverse shock dynamics and calculates synchrotron (including self-absorption or all spectral regimes) and inverse Compton radiation (including Klein-Nishina corrections); it can handle arbitrary user-defined ambient density profiles, central engine activity histories, viewing angles, and the jet structures of energy, Lorentz factor, and magnetization profiles. It supports both relativistic and non-relativistic regimes and includes lateral jet spreading effects. In this paper, we describe the numerical implementation of the framework and assess its computational performance. Our results demonstrate that VegasAfterglow is well-suited for interpreting current and future multi-wavelength observations in the era of multi-messenger astronomy.         |
