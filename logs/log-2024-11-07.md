|**Abstract**|            The Daisy World model has long served as a foundational framework for understanding the self-regulation of planetary biospheres, providing insights into the feedback mechanisms that may govern inhabited exoplanets. In this study, we extend the classic Daisy World model through the lens of Semantic Information Theory (SIT), aiming to characterize the information flow between the biosphere and planetary environment -- what we term the \emph{information architecture} of Daisy World systems. Our objective is to develop novel methodologies for analyzing the evolution of coupled planetary systems, including biospheres and geospheres, with implications for astrobiological observations and the identification of agnostic biosignatures. To operationalize SIT in this context, we introduce a version of the Daisy World model tailored to reflect potential conditions on M-dwarf exoplanets, formulating a system of stochastic differential equations that describe the co-evolution of the daisies and their planetary environment. Analysis of this Exo-Daisy World model reveals how correlations between the biosphere and environment intensify with rising stellar luminosity, and how these correlations correspond to distinct phases of information exchange between the coupled systems. This \emph{rein control} provides a quantitative description of the informational feedback between the biosphere and its host planet. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our approach for developing detailed ExoGaia models of inhabited exoplanetary systems, proposing new avenues for interpreting astrobiological data and exploring biosignature candidates.         |

|**Abstract**|            Filaments stand as pivotal structures within the cosmic web. However, direct detection of the cold gas content of the filaments remains challenging due to its inherent low brightness temperature. With the TNG hydrodynamical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of isolating faint filament HI signal from the FAST HI intensity mapping (IM) survey through pairwise stacking of galaxies, which yields an average HI filament signal amplitude of $\sim 0.28\ {\mu{\rm K}}$ at $z\simeq 0.1$. However, our simulations reveal a non-negligible contribution from HI-rich galaxies within or near the filaments. Particularly, the faint galaxies dominantly contribute to the extra filament HI signal. Our simulation also shows that the measurement uncertainty is produced by both thermal noise and background variation caused by brightness leakage from surrounding random galaxies. Given a fixed total observation time, a wide-field HI IM survey, which includes a large number of galaxy pairs, can simultaneously reduce thermal noise to below the filament signal level and minimize background variation to a negligible level. Through the end-to-end simulation, this work demonstrates the critical role of the galaxy pairwise stacking method in future filament HI detection, outlining a road map for filament HI detection in the next-generation HI IM surveys.         |

|| D. J. Setton, et al. -- incl., <mark>A. d. Graaff</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            Among the most puzzling early discoveries of JWST are "Little Red Dots" -- compact red sources that host broad Balmer emission lines and, in many cases, exhibit a "V shaped" change in slope in the rest-optical. The physical properties of Little Red Dots currently have order-of-magnitude uncertainties, because models to explain the continuum of these sources differ immensely. Here, we leverage the complete selection of red sources in the RUBIES program, supplemented with public PRISM spectra, to study the origin of this "V shape". By fitting a broken power law with a flexible inflection point, we find that a large fraction (20/44, nearly all spatially unresolved) of extremely red H$\alpha$ emitters at $2<z<6$ exhibit a strong change in slope, and that all strong inflections appear associated with the Balmer limit ($0.3645$ $\mu$m). Using a simple model of a reddened AGN with an unobscured scattered light component, we demonstrate that the observed "V shape" in Little Red Dots is unlikely to occur at any specific wavelength if the entire continuum is dominated by light from a power law AGN continuum. In contrast, models with an intrinsic feature at the Balmer limit, such as those that are dominated by evolved stellar populations in the rest-UV-to-optical, can produce the observed spectral shapes, provided that a reddened component picks up sufficiently redward of the break. While no model can comfortably explain the full Little Red Dot spectral energy distribution, the common inflection location suggests that it is most likely a single component that consistently dominates the rest-UV-to-optical in Little Red Dots, and that this component is associated with $T\sim10^4$ K hydrogen due to the clear preference for a break at H$_\infty$.         |
