|**Abstract**| Giant exoplanets seem to have on average a much larger heavy element content than the solar system giants. Past attempts to explain these heavy element contents include collisions between planets, accretion of volatile rich gas and accretion of gas enriched in micro-metre sized solids. However, these different theories individually could not explain the heavy element content of giants and the volatile to refractory ratios in atmospheres of giant planets at the same time. Here we combine the approaches of gas accretion enhanced with vapor and small micro-meter sized dust grains. As pebbles drift inwards, the volatile component evaporates and enriches the disc, while the smaller silicate core of the pebble continues to move inwards. The smaller silicate pebbles drift slower, leading to a pile-up of material interior to the water ice line, increasing the dust-to-gas ratio interior to the ice line. Under the assumption that these small dust grains follow the motion of the gas, gas accreting giants accrete large fractions of small solids in addition to the volatile vapor. The effectiveness of the solid enrichment requires a large disc radius to maintain the pebble flux for a long time and a large viscosity that reduces the size and inward drift of the small dust grains. However, this process depends crucially on the debated size difference of the pebbles interior and exterior of the water ice line. On the other hand, the volatile component released by the inward drifting pebbles can lead to a large enrichment with heavy element vapor, independently of a size difference of pebbles interior and exterior to the water ice line. Our model stresses the importance of the disc's radius and viscosity on the enrichment of dust and vapor. Consequently we show how our model could explain the heavy element content of the majority of giant planets by using combined estimates of dust and vapor enrichment. |

|**Abstract**| Carbon monoxide was recently reported in the atmosphere of the hot Jupiter WASP-39b using the NIRSpec PRISM transit observation of this planet, collected as part of the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science (JTEC ERS) Program. This detection, however, could not be confidently confirmed in the initial analysis of the higher resolution observations with NIRSpec G395H disperser. Here we confirm the detection of CO in the atmosphere of WASP-39b using the NIRSpec G395H data and cross-correlation techniques. We do this by searching for the CO signal in the unbinned transmission spectrum of the planet between 4.6 and 5.0 $\mu$m, where the contribution of CO is expected to be higher than that of other anticipated molecules in the planet's atmosphere. Our search results in a detection of CO with a cross-correlation function (CCF) significance of $6.6 \sigma$ when using a template with only ${\rm ^{12}C^{16}O}$ lines. The CCF significance of the CO signal increases to $7.5 \sigma$ when including in the template lines from additional CO isotopologues, with the largest contribution being from ${\rm ^{13}C^{16}O}$. Our results highlight how cross-correlation techniques can be a powerful tool for unveiling the chemical composition of exoplanetary atmospheres from medium-resolution transmission spectra, including the detection of isotopologues. |

|| A. Widmark, T. D. Yavetz, X. Li |

|**Abstract**| Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) has dynamical properties that differ significantly from cold dark matter (CDM). These dynamical differences are strongly manifested on the spatial scale of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs), which roughly corresponds to the de Broglie wavelength of a canonical mass FDM particle. We study simulations of a dSph satellite which is tidally perturbed by its host galaxy, in order to identify dynamical signatures that are unique to FDM, and to quantify the imprints of such perturbations on an observable stellar tracer population. We find that a perturbed FDM soliton develops a long-standing breathing mode, whereas for CDM such a breathing mode quickly phase-mixes and disappears. We also demonstrate that such signatures become imprinted on the dynamics of a stellar tracer population, making them observable with sufficiently precise astrometric measurements. |
