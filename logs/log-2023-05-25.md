|**Abstract**| Galactic bars can drive cold gas inflows towards the centres of galaxies. The gas transport happens primarily through the so-called bar ``dust lanes'', which connect the galactic disc at kpc scales to the nuclear rings at hundreds of pc scales much like two gigantic galactic rivers. Once in the ring, the gas can fuel star formation activity, galactic outflows, and central supermassive black holes. Measuring the mass inflow rates is therefore important to understanding the mass/energy budget and evolution of galactic nuclei. In this work, we use CO datacubes from the PHANGS-ALMA survey and a simple geometrical method to measure the bar-driven mass inflow rate onto the nuclear ring of the barred galaxy NGC~1097. The method assumes that the gas velocity in the bar lanes is parallel to the lanes in the frame co-rotating with the bar, and allows one to derive the inflow rates from sufficiently sensitive and resolved position-position-velocity diagrams if the bar pattern speed and galaxy orientations are known. We find an inflow rate of $\dot{M}=(3.0 \pm 2.1)\, \rm M_\odot\, yr^{-1}$ averaged over a time span of 40 Myr, which varies by a factor of a few over timescales of $\sim$10 Myr. Most of the inflow appears to be consumed by star formation in the ring which is currently occurring at a rate of ${\rm SFR}\simeq~1.8$-$2 \rm M_\odot\, yr^{-1}$, suggesting that the inflow is causally controlling the star formation rate in the ring as a function of time. |

|**Abstract**| The Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA), a pathfinder of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope of the Einstein Probe (EP) mission, was successfully launched onboard the SATech-01 satellite of the Chinese Academy of Sciences on 27 July 2022. In this paper, we introduce the design and on-ground test results of the LEIA instrument. Using state-of-the-art Micro-Pore Optics (MPO), a wide field-of-view (FoV) of 346 square degrees (18.6 degrees * 18.6 degrees) of the X-ray imager is realized. An optical assembly composed of 36 MPO chips is used to focus incident X-ray photons, and four large-format complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors, each of 6 cm * 6 cm, are used as the focal plane detectors. The instrument has an angular resolution of 4 - 8 arcmin (in FWHM) for the central focal spot of the point spread function, and an effective area of 2 - 3 cm2 at 1 keV in essentially all the directions within the field of view. The detection passband is 0.5 - 4 keV in the soft X-rays and the sensitivity is 2 - 3 * 10-11 erg s-1 cm-2 (about 1 mini-Crab) at 1,000 second observation. The total weight of LEIA is 56 kg and the power is 85 W. The satellite, with a design lifetime of 2 years, operates in a Sun-synchronous orbit of 500 km with an orbital period of 95 minutes. LEIA is paving the way for future missions by verifying in flight the technologies of both novel focusing imaging optics and CMOS sensors for X-ray observation, and by optimizing the working setups of the instrumental parameters. In addition, LEIA is able to carry out scientific observations to find new transients and to monitor known sources in the soft X-ray band, albeit limited useful observing time available. |

|**Abstract**| We have embarked in a systematic study of the X-ray emission in a volume-limited sample of M dwarf stars, in order to explore the full range of activity levels present in their coronae and, thus, to understand the conditions in their outer atmospheres and their possible impact on the circumstellar environment. We identify in a recent catalog of the Gaia objects within 10 pc from the Sun all the stars with spectral type between M0 and M4, and search systematically for X-ray measurements of this sample. To this end, we use both archival data (from ROSAT, XMM-Newton, and from the ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) onboard the Russian Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma mission) and our own dedicated XMM-Newton observations. To make inferences on the properties of the M dwarf corona we compare the range of their observed X-ray emission levels to the flux radiated by the Sun from different types of magnetic structures: coronal holes, background corona, active regions and cores of active regions. At the current state of our project, with more than 90\% of the 10pc M dwarf sample observed in X-rays, only GJ 745 A has no detection. With an upper limit luminosity of log Lx [erg/s] < 25.4 and an X-ray surface flux of log FX,SURF [erg/cm^2/s] < 3.6 GJ 745 A defines the lower boundary of the X-ray emission level of M dwarfs. Together with its companion GJ 745 B, GJ 745 A it is the only star in this volume-complete sample located in the range of FX,SURF that corresponds to the faintest solar coronal structures, the coronal holes. The ultra-low X-ray emission level of GJ 745 B (log Lx [erg/s] = 25.6 and log FX,SURF [erg/cm^2/s] = 3.8) is entirely attributed to flaring activity, indicating that, while its corona is dominated by coronal holes, at least one magnetically active structure is present and determines the total X-ray brightness and the coronal temperature of the star. |

|**Abstract**| Most observations of the solar corona beyond 2 Rs consist of broadband visible light imagery from coronagraphs. The associated diagnostics mainly consist of kinematics and derivations of the electron number density. While the measurement of the properties of emission lines can provide crucial additional diagnostics of the coronal plasma (temperatures, velocities, abundances, etc.), these observations are comparatively rare. In visible wavelengths, observations at these heights are limited to total eclipses. In the VUV range, very few additional observations have been achieved since the pioneering results of UVCS. One of the objectives of the Full Sun Imager (FSI) channel of the EUI telescope on board the Solar Orbiter mission has been to provide very wide field-of-view EUV diagnostics of the morphology and dynamics of the solar atmosphere in temperature regimes that are typical of the lower transition region and of the corona. FSI carries out observations in two narrowbands of the EUV spectrum centered on 17.4 nm and 30.4 nm that are dominated, respectively, by lines of Fe IX/X (formed in the corona around 1 MK) and by the resonance line of He II (formed around 80 kK in the lower transition region). Unlike previous EUV imagers, FSI includes a moveable occulting disk that can be inserted in the optical path to reduce the amount of instrumental stray light to a minimum. FSI detects signals at 17.4 nm up to the edge of its FOV (7~Rs), which is about twice further than was previously possible. Comparisons with observations by the LASCO and Metis coronagraphs confirm the presence of morphological similarities and differences between the broadband visible light and EUV emissions, as documented on the basis of prior eclipse and space-based observations. The very-wide-field observations of FSI are paving the way for future dedicated instruments. |
