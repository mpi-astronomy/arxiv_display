|**Abstract**| Dusty star-forming galaxies emit most of their light at far-IR to mm wavelengths as their star formation is highly obscured. Far-IR and mm observations have revealed their dust, neutral and molecular gas properties. The sensitivity of JWST at rest-frame optical and near-infrared wavelengths now allows the study of the stellar and ionized gas content. We investigate the spatially resolved distribution and kinematics of the ionized gas in GN20, a dusty star forming galaxy at $z$=4.0548. We present deep MIRI/MRS integral field spectroscopy of the near-infrared rest-frame emission of GN20. We detect spatially resolved \paa, out to a radius of 6 kpc, distributed in a clumpy morphology. The star formation rate derived from \paa\ (144 $\pm$ 9 \msunperyear) is only 7.7 $\pm 0.5 $\% of the infrared star formation rate (1860 $\pm$ 90 \msunperyear). We attribute this to very high extinction (A$_V$ = 17.2 $\pm$ 0.4 mag, or A$_{V,mixed}$ = 44 $\pm$ 3 mag), especially in the nucleus of GN20, where only faint \paa\ is detected, suggesting a deeply buried starburst. We identify four, spatially unresolved, clumps in the \paa\ emission. Based on the double peaked \paa\ profile we find that each clump consist of at least two sub-clumps. We find mass upper limits consistent with them being formed in a gravitationally unstable gaseous disk. The UV bright region of GN20 does not have any detected \paa\ emission, suggesting an age of more than 10 Myrs for this region of the galaxy. From the rotation profile of \paa\ we conclude that the gas kinematics are rotationally dominated and the $v_{rot}/\sigma_{m} = 3.8 \pm 1.4$ is similar to low-redshift LIRGs. We speculate that the clumps seen in GN20 could contribute to building up the inner disk and bulge of GN20. |

|**Abstract**| We perform a systematic, multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of X-ray detected Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at $z=0.2-0.8$ with SDSS counterparts in the Stripe 82 region, consisting of 60 type-1 and 137 type-2 AGNs covering a 2--10 keV luminosity range of $41.6 < {\rm log}\ L_{\rm x} < 44.7$. The latest CIGALE code, where dusty polar components are included, is employed. To obtain reliable host and AGN parameters in type-1 AGNs, we utilize the image decomposed optical SED of host galaxies by Li et al. (2021) based on the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) images. The mean ratio of black hole masses ($M_{\rm BH}$) and stellar masses ($M_{\rm stellar}$) of our X-ray detected type-1 AGN sample, $\log (M_{\rm BH}/M_{\rm stellar}) = -2.7\pm0.5$, is close to the local relation between black hole and stellar masses, as reported by Li et al. (2021) for SDSS quasars. This ratio is slightly lower than that found for more luminous ($\log L_{\rm bol} > 45$) type-1 AGNs at $z\sim1.5$. This can be explained by the AGN-luminosity dependence of $\log (M_{\rm BH}/M_{\rm stellar})$, which little evolves with redshift. We confirm the trend that the UV-to-X-ray slope ($\alpha_{\rm OX}$) or X-ray-to-bolometric correction factor ($\kappa_{2-10}$) increases with AGN luminosity or Eddington ratio. We find that type-1 and type-2 AGNs with the same luminosity ranges share similar host stellar-mass distributions, whereas type-2s tend to show smaller AGN luminosities than type-1s. This supports the luminosity (or Eddington ratio) dependent unified scheme. |
