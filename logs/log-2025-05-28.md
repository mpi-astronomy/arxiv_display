|**Abstract**|            The largest reservoir of carbon in protoplanetary discs is stored in refractory organics, which thermally decompose into the gas-phase at the organics line, well interior to the water iceline. Because this region is so close to the host star, it is often assumed that the released gaseous material is rapidly accreted and plays little role in the evolution of the disc composition. However, laboratory experiments show that the thermal decomposition process is irreversible, breaking macromolecular refractory organics into simpler, volatile carbon-bearing compounds. As a result, unlike the iceline of other volatiles, which traps vapor inwards due to recondensation, the organics line remains permeable, allowing gaseous carbon to diffuse outward without returning to the solid phase. In this paper, we investigate how this process affects the disc composition, particularly the gas-phase C/H and C/O ratios, by incorporating it into a 1D evolution model for gas and solids, and assuming refractory organics dominantly decompose into C$_2$H$_2$. Our results show that this process allows this carbon-rich gas to survive well beyond the organics line (out to $7 \mathrm{~au}$ around a solar-mass star) and for much longer timescales, such that its abundance is increased by an order of magnitude. This has several implications in planet formation, notably by altering how the composition of solids and gas relate, and the fraction of heavy elements available to giant planets. In the framework of our model, refractory organics significantly influence the evolution of the gas-phase C/O ratio, which may help interpreting measurements made with Spitzer and JWST.         |

|**Abstract**|            The 12C/13C isotope ratio has been derived towards numerous cold clouds (20-50 K) and a couple protoplanetary disks and exoplanet atmospheres. However, direct measurements of this ratio in the warm gas (>100 K) around young low-mass protostars remain scarce, but are required to study its evolution during star and planet formation. We derived 12C/13C ratios from the isotopologues of the complex organic molecules (COMs) CH3OH and CH3CN in the warm gas towards seven Class 0/I protostellar systems to improve our understanding of the evolution of the 12C/13C ratios during star and planet formation. We used the data that were taken as part of the PRODIGE large program with the NOEMA at 1mm. The emission of CH3OH and CH3CN is spatially unresolved in the PRODIGE data (300au scale). Derived rotational temperatures exceed 100K, telling us that they trace the gas of the hot corino, where CH3CN probes hotter regions than CH3OH on average (290 K versus 180 K). The column density ratios between the 12C and 13C isotopologues, derived from LTE analysis, range from 4 to 30, thus, are significantly lower than the expected local ISM isotope ratio of about 68. Assuming that CH3CN and CH3OH may inherit the 12C/13C ratio from their precursor species, astrochemical models were conducted for the latter and compared with our observational results. We conclude that an enrichment in 13C in COMs at the earliest protostellar stages is likely inherited from the COMs' precursor species, whose 12C/13C ratios are set during the prestellar stage via isotopic exchange reactions. This also implies that low 12C/13C ratios observed at later evolutionary stages could at least partially be inherited. A final conclusion on 12C/13C ratios in protostellar environments requires improved observations to tackle current observational limitations and additional modelling efforts.         |

|**Abstract**|            The chemical evolution of the inner regions of protoplanetary discs is a complex process. Several factors influence it, one being the inward drift and evaporation of volatile-rich pebbles. During the disc's evolution, its inner part is first enriched with evaporating water-ice, resulting in a low C/O ratio. Afterwards, C-rich gas from the outer disc is transported inwards. Consequently, the C/O ratio of the inner disc increases again after 2 Myr. Previously, we studied how internal photoevaporation influences these processes in discs around Sun-like stars. We now extend our study to lower-mass stars, where the time evolution of the disc's C/O ratio is different due to the closer-in position of the evaporation fronts and differences in disc mass, size and structure. Our simulations are carried out with the semi-analytical 1D disc model chemcomp, which includes viscous evolution and heating, pebble growth and drift, pebble evaporation and condensation, as well as a simple chemical partitioning model. We show that internal photoevaporation plays a major role in the evolution of protoplanetary discs: As for Sun-like stars, photoevaporation opens a gap, which stops inward drifting pebbles. In addition, volatile-rich gas from the outer disc is carried away by the photoevaporative winds. Consequently, the C/O ratio in the inner disc remains low, contradicting observations of discs around low-mass stars. Our model implies that young inner discs (< 2 Myr) should be O-rich and C-poor, while older discs (> 2 Myr) should be C-rich. The survival of discs to this age can be attributed to lower photoevaporation rates, which either originate from a large spread of observed X-ray luminosities or from the photoevaporation model used here, which likely overestimates the photoevaporation efficiency. A reduction of the latter brings the calculated elemental abundances into better agreement with observations.         |

|**Abstract**|            Young star clusters can inherit bulk rotation from the molecular clouds from which they have formed. This rotation can affect the long-term evolution of a star cluster and its constituent stellar populations. In this study, we aim to characterize the effects of different degrees of initial rotation on star clusters with primordial binaries. The simulations are performed using NBODY6++GPU. We find that initial rotation strongly affects the early evolution of star clusters. Rapidly rotating clusters show angular momentum transport from the inner parts to the outskirts, resulting in a core collapse. Angular momentum transport is accompanied by a highly elongated bar-like structure morphology. The effects of bulk rotation are reduced on the timescale of two-body relaxation. Rotating and non-rotating clusters experience changes in the direction of angular momentum near the dissolution and early evolution due to the tidal field, respectively. We present synthetic observations of simulated clusters for comparison with future observations in filters of Gaia, CSST, and HST. This work shows the effects of bulk rotation on systems with primordial binaries and could be used for the identification of rotation signatures in observed open clusters.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a spectroscopic sample of 23 broad-line AGNs (BLAGNs) at $3\lesssim z\lesssim 6$ selected using F322W2+F444W NIRCam/WFSS grism spectroscopy of the central 100 ${\rm arcmin^2}$ area of the NEXUS survey. Among these BLAGNs, 15 are classified as Little Red Dots (LRDs) based on their rest-frame UV-optical spectral slopes and compact morphology. The number density of LRDs is $\sim 10^{-5}\,{\rm cMpc^{-3}}$, with a hint of declining towards the lower end of the probed redshift range. These BLAGNs and LRDs span broad H$\alpha$ luminosities of $\sim 10^{42.2}-10^{43.7}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, black hole masses of $\sim 10^{6.3}-10^{8.4}\,M_\odot$, and Eddington ratios of $\sim 0.1-1$ (median value 0.4), though the black hole mass and Eddington ratio estimates carry large systematic uncertainties. Half of the LRDs show strong Balmer absorption, suggesting high-density gas surrounding the line-emitting region. We detect extended (hundreds of parsec) rest-frame UV-optical emission from the host galaxy in the majority of these LRDs, which contributes significantly or even dominantly to their total UV emission. This host emission largely accounts for the peculiar UV upturn of the LRD spectral energy distribution. We also measure the small-scale ($\lesssim 1\,{\rm cMpc}$) clustering of these BLAGNs and LRDs by cross-correlating with a photometric galaxy sample. Extrapolating the power-law two-point correlation function model to large linear scales, we infer a linear bias of $3.30_{-2.04}^{+2.88}$ and typical halo masses of a few $\times 10^{11}\,h^{-1}M_\odot$ for BLAGNs at the sample median redshift of $z\sim 4.5$. However, the inferred linear bias and halo masses of LRDs, while formally consistent with those for BLAGNs at $\sim 1.5\sigma$, appear too large to be compatible with their space density, suggesting LRDs may have strong excess clustering on small scales.         |
