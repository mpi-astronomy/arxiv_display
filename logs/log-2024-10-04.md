|**Abstract**|            Dwarf galaxies hold the key to crucial frontiers of astrophysics, however, their faintness renders spectroscopy challenging. Here we present the JWST Cycle 2 survey, All the Little Things (ALT, PID 3516), which is designed to seek late-forming Pop III stars and the drivers of reionization at $z\sim6-7$. ALT has acquired the deepest NIRCam grism spectroscopy yet (7-27 hr), at JWST's most sensitive wavelengths (3-4 $\mu$m), covering the powerful lensing cluster Abell 2744. Over the same 30 arcmin$^2$, ALT's ultra-deep F070W+F090W imaging ($\sim$30 mag) enables selection of very faint sources at $z>6$. We demonstrate the success of ALT's novel ``butterfly" mosaic to solve spectral confusion and contamination, and introduce the ``Allegro" method for emission line identification. By collecting spectra for every source in the field of view, ALT has measured precise ($R\sim1600$) redshifts for 1630 sources at $z=0.2-8.5$. This includes one of the largest samples of distant dwarf galaxies: [1015, 475, 50] sources less massive than the SMC, Fornax, and Sculptor with $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})<$[8.5, 7.5, 6.5]. We showcase ALT's discovery space with: (i) spatially resolved spectra of lensed clumps in galaxies as faint as $M_{\rm{UV}}\sim-15$; (ii) large-scale clustering -- overdensities at $z$=[2.50, 2.58, 3.97, 4.30, 5.66, 5.77, 6.33] hosting massive galaxies with striking Balmer breaks; (iii) small-scale clustering -- a system of satellites around a Milky Way analog at $z\sim6$; (iv) spectroscopically confirmed multiple images that help constrain the lensing model underlying all science in this legacy field; (v) sensitive star-formation maps based on dust-insensitive tracers such as Pa$\alpha$; (vi) direct spectroscopic discovery of rare sources such as AGN with ionized outflows. These results provide a powerful proof of concept for how grism surveys maximize the potential of strong lensing fields.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present the Merian Survey, an optical imaging survey optimized for studying the physical properties of bright star-forming dwarf galaxies. Merian is carried out with two medium-band filters ($N708$ and $N540$, centered at $708$ and $540$ nm), custom-built for the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the Blanco telescope. Merian covers $\sim 750\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ of equatorial fields, overlapping with the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) wide, deep, and ultra-deep fields. When combined with the HSC-SSP imaging data ($grizy$), the new Merian DECam medium-band imaging allows for photometric redshift measurements via the detection of H$\rm\alpha$ and [OIII] line emission flux excess in the $N708$ and $N540$ filters, respectively, at $0.06<z<0.10$. We present an overview of the survey design, observations taken to date, data reduction using the LSST Science Pipelines, including aperture-matched photometry for accurate galaxy colors, and a description of the data included in the first data release (DR1). The key science goals of Merian include: probing the dark matter halos of dwarf galaxies out to their virial radii using high signal-to-noise weak lensing profile measurements, decoupling the effects of baryonic processes from dark matter, and understanding the role of black holes in dwarf galaxy evolution. This rich dataset will also offer unique opportunities for studying extremely metal-poor galaxies via their strong [OIII] emission and H$\rm\alpha$ lines, as well as [OIII] emitters at $z\sim 0.4$, and Ly$\rm\alpha$ emitters at $z\sim 3.3$ and $z\sim 4.8$. Merian showcases the power of utilizing narrow and medium-band filters alongside broad-band filters for sky imaging, demonstrating their synergistic capacity to unveil astrophysical insights across diverse astrophysical phenomena.         |

|| A. Mintz, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            Using medium-band imaging from the newly released Merian Survey, we conduct a nonparametric morphological analysis of H$\alpha$ emission maps and stellar continua for a sample of galaxies with $8\lesssim\log (M_\star/M_\odot) < 10.3$ at $0.064<z<0.1$. We present a novel method for estimating the stellar continuum emission through the Merian Survey's N708 medium-band filter, which we use to measure H$\alpha$ emission and produce H$\alpha$ maps for our sample of galaxies with seven-band Merian photometry and available spectroscopy. We measure nonparametric morphological statistics for the H$\alpha$ and stellar continuum images, explore how the morphology of the H$\alpha$ differs from the continuum, and investigate how the parameters evolve with the galaxies' physical properties. In agreement with previous results for more massive galaxies, we find that the asymmetry of the stellar continuum increases with specific star formation rate (SSFR) and we extend the trend to lower masses, also showing that it holds for the asymmetry of the H$\alpha$ emission. We find that the lowest-mass galaxies with the highest SSFR have H$\alpha$ emission that is consistently heterogeneous and compact, while the less active galaxies in this mass range have H$\alpha$ emission that appears diffuse. At higher masses, our data do not span a sufficient range in SSFR to evaluate whether similar trends apply. We conclude that high SSFRs in low-mass galaxies likely result from dynamical instabilities that compress a galaxy's molecular gas to a dense region near the center.         |

|| Z. Cao, B. Jiang, S. Wang, <mark>J. Li</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-10-04*|
|*Comments*| *9 pages, 10 figures, Accepted by The Astronomical Journal*|
|**Abstract**|            The extinction law from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR) (0.2-24 $\mu$m) is determined by relying on the blue-edge method and color excess ratios for some nearby molecular clouds, from low mass star forming region to massive star forming region. The observational data are collected from nine photometric surveys, along with stellar parameters from the APOGEE and LAMOST spectroscopic surveys. Within the uncertainties, the optical ratio of selective to total extinction ($R_{G_{BP}}$) does not vary substantially across the clouds, irrespective of the density, specifically $R_{G_{BP}} =2.302\pm0.027$, where $R_{G_{BP}} \equiv A_{G_{BP}}/E_{G_{BP},G_{RP}}$. The IR extinction law is consistent with \citet{Wang19_law}. The extinction law in the UV band is compromised by the shallow depth with $A_{V} \leq 2$ mag and is hard to describe by one parameter $R$. In addition, the extinction in the WISE/W1 band is significantly larger than in the Spitzer/IRAC1 band in the dense regions, which is attributed to the ice water absorption.         |
