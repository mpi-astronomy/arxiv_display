|**Abstract**|            The fraction of "dark pixels" in the Ly$\alpha$ and other Lyman-series forests at $z\sim 5-6$ provides a powerful constraint on the end of the reionization process. Any spectral region showing transmission must be highly ionized, while dark regions could be ionized or neutral, thus the dark pixel fraction provides a (nearly) model independent upper limit to the volume-filling fraction of the neutral intergalactic medium, modulo choices in binning scale and dark pixel definition. Here we provide updated measurements of the 3.3 comoving Mpc dark pixel fraction at $z=4.85-6.25$ in the Ly$\alpha$, Ly$\beta$, and Ly$\gamma$ forests of 34 deep $5.8\lesssim z\lesssim 6.6$ quasar spectra from the (enlarged) XQR-30 sample. Using the negative pixel method to measure the dark pixel fraction, we derive fiducial $1\sigma$ upper limits on the volume-average neutral hydrogen fraction of $\langle x_{\rm{HI}}\rangle \leq \{0.030 + 0.048, 0.095 + 0.037, 0.191 + 0.056, 0.199 + 0.087\}$ at $\bar{z} = \{5.481, 5.654, 5.831, 6.043\}$ from the optimally sensitive combination of the Ly$\beta$ and Ly$\gamma$ forests. We further demonstrate an alternative method that treats the forest flux as a mixture of dark and transparent regions, where the latter are modeled using a physically-motivated parametric form for the intrinsic opacity distribution. The resulting model-dependent upper limits on $\langle x_{\rm{HI}}\rangle$ are similar to those derived from our fiducial model-independent analysis. We confirm that the bulk of reionization must be finished at $z>6$, while leaving room for an extended "soft landing" to the reionization history down to $z\sim 5.4$ suggested by Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity fluctuations.         |

|**Abstract**|            An understanding of the assembly history of the complex star cluster Omega Centauri has long been sought after, with many studies separating the stars on the color-magnitude diagram into multiple groupings across small magnitude ranges. Utilizing the oMEGACat combined astro-photometric and spectroscopic dataset we parse 14 subpopulations from the upper red-giant branch to below the main-sequence turnoff. We combine our results with previous works to estimate the age and age spread of each population. We find that the chemically enhanced (P2) populations are all ~1 Gyr younger (~11.6 Gyr old) and have significantly higher intrinsic age spreads (0.6 Gyr) than the primordial (P1) populations (~12.6 Gyr old, 0.3 Gyr spread), with the intermediate (Im) populations falling in between the two. Additionally, we connect for the first time the Chromosome Diagram to the two-stream age-metallicity relation, allowing us to link the P1 and P2 stars to the distinct star formation tracks, proposed to be in-situ and ex-situ contributions to the cluster's assembly. Our results are consistent with some suggested formation models and rule out others but no current model can explain all observed features of the subpopulations.         |

|**Abstract**|            The dipper subclass of YSOs are characterised by frequent dips in their light curves. Irregular dippers do not show periodic signatures and have dips accounting for significant proportions of their photospheric flux. Given the short timescales on which these dips occur, their driving mechanisms are linked to the inner circumstellar disc dynamics. We present the first multi-epoch analysis of 16 irregular dippers observed with X-Shooter. Investigating the properties of their dips, and in particular the analysis of the dust characteristics, we aim to understand the root of their variability, and get a glimpse of the inner disc behaviour. We employed a novel approach to measure the properties of the dips, by combining class III templates with Gaia photometry to construct the intrinsic photospheres. We measured several dip properties including the depth of the dips, near-infrared (NIR) excesses, and their optical depths as a function of wavelength. We record 20 significant dips that range in their dip properties and show no relation to one another. In almost all cases, the low optical depths and small NIR excesses are observed. Comparison of their optical depths with grain opacity models show that the dips can be explained by the presence of dust substructures containing processed grains obscuring their photospheres and/or their discs. These grain distributions can have maximum sizes as large as 20$\mu m$ and in many cases have almost grey-like extinction, while some require a strong scattering component. The findings highlight the extent of the irregularity of dippers, but also link it to the dust dynamics in the inner regions of circumstellar discs. The dust substructures causing the variability require processed dust grains to be lifted above the disc into the line of sight. Possible lifting mechanisms including disc winds, unstable accretion columns, and disc warps are discussed.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-31*|

|**Abstract**|            We present direct numerical simulations demonstrating deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) driven by oxygen flames in Type Ia supernova progenitors. Using the Castro hydrodynamics code coupled with the ``aprox13'' 13-isotope nuclear network, we simulate combustion in isolated fuel regions where oxygen flames trail carbon flames. In a fiducial one-dimensional run at $\rho_{0}=3.5\times10^{7}\ \mathrm{g\ cm^{-3}}$ we observe spontaneous DDT of the oxygen flame via the Zel'dovich gradient mechanism when the carbon-oxygen separation reaches $\sim 10\ \mathrm{km}$. The oxygen detonation then captures the carbon flame and triggers a stable carbon detonation. Systematic one-dimensional parameter scans show that successful carbon DDT requires upstream densities in the range $(3.1$--$3.6)\times10^{7}\ \mathrm{g\ cm^{-3}}$ and a minimum carbon-flame thickness of $\gtrsim 20\ \mathrm{m}$. Two-dimensional simulations confirm DDT and demonstrate that the multidimensional cellular structure of the oxygen detonation can promote carbon detonation at somewhat lower densities than in one dimension. These results provide direct numerical evidence that oxygen-flame-driven DDT is physically plausible in turbulent white-dwarf environments and underscore the importance of multidimensional effects for Type Ia supernova explosion modeling.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a detailed single-pulse study of the long-period pulsar PSR J2129+4119 using high-sensitivity FAST observations. Despite locating well below the traditional death line, the pulsar exhibits sustained and multi-modal emission behavior, including nulls, weak pulses, regular emission, and occasional bright pulses. The nulling fraction is measured to be $8.13\% \pm 0.51\%$, with null durations typically under four pulse periods. Fluctuation spectral analysis reveals both phase-modulated subpulse drifting and intermittent beat-like modulation. At the same time, polarization profiles show high linear polarization and stable polarization position angle (PPA) swings consistent with a near-tangential sightline geometry. Quasi-periodic microstructures are detected in 11.54\% of regular pulses, with a mean periodicity and width of 4.57 ms and 4.30 ms, respectively. A well-defined scintillation arc in the secondary spectrum confirms the presence of a localized scattering screen. These results indicate that PSR J2129+4119 remains magnetospherically active and coherently emitting despite its low energy loss rate, offering key insights into pulsar emission physics near the death line.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2025-10-31*|
|*Comments*| **|
|**Abstract**|            We present theoretical predictions of the born-again scenario for post-asymptotic giant-branch stars. An extensive model grid for born-again objects has been constructed, particularly including models for the Very Late Thermal Pulse with and without convective overshooting, and also including models for the Late Thermal Pulse. We constructed a large parameter space to analyze the dependencies of the born-again model on core mass, hydrogen-envelope mass, and overshoot parameters, and we analyzed how changes in these parameters affect the models' evolution. We applied our grid of models to interpret observations of DY\,Cen, a star exhibiting characteristics similar to confirmed born-again stars. We compared DY\,Cen with models from multiple aspects, including heating rate, evolutionary tracks, and surface abundances. Ultimately, we concluded that none of our born-again models could match all of the observed properties of DY\,Cen, especially its surface chemistry; DY\,Cen is therefore an unlikely born-again star.         |

|**Abstract**|            The standard $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model has encountered serious challenges and the $H_0$ tension has become more significant with increasingly precise cosmological observation. Meanwhile, inconsistencies in measurements of the curvature parameter $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$ between different datasets also have emerged. In this work, we employ two global and cosmic age-based parameterizations, PAge and MAPAge, to perform model-independent measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$ by utilizing the inverse distance ladder (IDL). To construct the PAge-improved IDL, we utilize the strong gravitational lensing (SGL), cosmic chronometers (CC), and gamma ray bursts (GRB) data to calibrate the latest DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation data and DESY5 type Ia supernova data. Our analysis indicate that DESI+DESY5+SGL+CC+GRB gives $H_0=71.59\pm 0.94\,{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ in the MAPAge model, reducing the $H_0$ tension to the $1.0\sigma$ level. Extending to MAPAge$+\Omega_{\rm K}$ model, we obtain $\Omega_\mathrm{K}=0.001\pm 0.038$, which suggests that current late-time data are consistent with a flat universe. Finally, the Bayesian analysis indicates that the present late-universe data provide weak to moderate evidence in favor of PAge and MAPAge relative to $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$.         |

|**Abstract**|            Stars on bound orbits around a supermassive black hole may undergo repeated partial tidal disruption events (rpTDEs), producing periodic flares. While several candidates have been suggested, definitive confirmation of these events remains elusive. We report the discovery of AT2023uqm, a nuclear transient that has exhibited at least five periodic optical flares, making it only the second confirmed case of periodicity after ASASSN-14ko. Uniquely, the flares from AT2023uqm show a nearly exponential increase in energy--a "runaway" phenomenon signaling the star's progressive destruction. This behavior is consistent with rpTDEs of low-mass, main-sequence stars or evolved giant stars. Multiwavelength observations and spectroscopic analysis of the two most recent flares reinforce its interpretation as an rpTDE. Intriguingly, each flare displays a similar double-peaked structure, potentially originating from a double-peaked mass fallback rate or two discrete collisions per orbit. The extreme ratio of peak separation to orbital period draws attention to the possibility of a giant star being disrupted, which could be distinguished from a low-mass main-sequence star by its future mass-loss evolution. Our analysis demonstrates the power of rpTDEs to probe the properties of disrupted stars and the physical processes of tidal disruption, though it is currently limited by our knowledge of these events. AT2023uqm emerges as the most compelling rpTDE thus far, serving as a crucial framework for modeling and understanding these phenomena.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present Flinch, a fully differentiable and high-performance framework for field-level inference on angular maps, developed to improve the flexibility and scalability of current methodologies. Flinch is integrated with differentiable cosmology tools, allowing gradients to propagate from individual map pixels directly to the underlying cosmological parameters. This architecture allows cosmological inference to be carried out directly from the map itself, bypassing the need to specify a likelihood for intermediate summary statistics. Using simulated, masked CMB temperature maps, we validate our pipeline by reconstructing both maps and angular power spectra, and we perform cosmological parameter inference with competitive precision. In comparison with the standard pseudo-$C_\ell$ approach, Flinch delivers substantially tighter constraints, with error bars reduced by up to 40%. Among the gradient-based samplers routinely employed in field-level analyses, we further show that MicroCanonical Langevin Monte Carlo provides orders-of-magnitude improvements in sampling efficiency over currently employed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers, greatly reducing computational expense.         |
