|**Abstract**|            We present a direct measurement of extinction curves using corrected $Gaia$ XP spectra of the common sources in $Gaia$ DR3 and LAMOST DR7. Our analysis of approximately 370 thousand high-quality samples yielded a high-precision average extinction curve for the Milky Way. After incorporating infrared photometric data from 2MASS and WISE, the extinction curve spans wavelengths from 0.336 to 4.6 $\mu$m. We determine an average $R_{55}$ of $2.730 \pm 0.007$, corresponding to $R_V= 3.073 \pm 0.009$, and a near-infrared power-law index $\alpha$ of $1.935 \pm 0.037$. Our study confirmed some intermediate-scale structures within the optical range. Two new features were identified at 540 and 769 nm, and their intensities exhibited a correlation with extinction and $R_V$. This extinction curve can be used to investigate the characteristics of dust and enhance the extinction correction of Milky Way stars. A Python package for this extinction curve is available.         |

|**Abstract**|            The GLOSTAR survey studies star formation with the VLA and the Effelsberg 100m telescope in the Galactic plane (-2d<l<60d; |b|<1d) and the Cygnus X region with unprecedented sensitivity in both flux density (~50uJy/beam) and the capability of detecting emission with angular scales in the range from 1" to the largest radio structures in the Galaxy. We provide a complete GLOSTAR-VLA D-configuration radio source catalog for the covered part of the Galactic disk. A catalog for the pilot region (28d<l<36d) has been published in a previous paper and here we present the complementary catalog for the area within 2d<l<28d, 36d<l<60d and |b|<1d. Observations were taken with the VLA in a 4-8GHz band to image 100 degrees$^2$ of the inner Galactic disk at a reference frequency of 5.8GHz, using 260h of telescope time. We determined spectral indices inside the observed band and in the frequency range 1.4-5.8GHz by complementing our results with those from the THOR survey (1-2GHz). The final images have an angular resolution of 18" and an average sensitivity of 123uJy/beam. The sensitivity is better (~60uJy/beam) in areas free of extended emission. The Galactic disk catalog presented in this work, consists of 11211 radio sources. Of these, 1965 are known large-scale structure sources such as star-forming region complexes, well-known SNRs, SNR candidates or parts thereof. The remaining 9227 are discrete individual sources. Source parameters, namely flux densities, sizes, spectral indices, and classifications are reported. We identify 769 HII region candidates, 359 are newly classified as such. The mean value of spectral indices of 225 HII regions is 0.14$\pm$0.02, consistent with most of them emitting optically thin thermal radio emission. Combining our results with the previously published catalog of the pilot region, the final GLOSTAR-VLA D-configuration catalog contains 12981 radio sources.         |
