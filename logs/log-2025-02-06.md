|**Abstract**|            The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revolutionizing our understanding of the Universe by unveiling faint, near-infrared dropouts previously beyond our reach, ranging from exceptionally dusty sources to galaxies up to redshift $z \sim 14$. In this paper, we identify F200W-dropout objects in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey which are absent from existing catalogs. Our selection method can effectively identify obscured low-mass ($\log \text{M}_* \leq 9$) objects at $z \leq 6$, massive dust-rich sources up to $z \sim 12$, and ultra-high-redshift ($z > 15$) candidates. Primarily relying on NIRCam photometry from the latest CEERS data release and supplementing with Mid-Infrared/(sub-)mm data when available, our analysis pipeline combines multiple SED-fitting codes, star formation histories, and CosMix - a novel tool for astronomical stacking. Our work highlights three $2<z<3$ dusty dwarf galaxies which have larger masses compared to the typical dusty dwarfs previously identified in CEERS. Additionally, we reveal five faint sources with significant probability of lying above $z>15$, with best-fit masses compatible with $\Lambda$CDM and a standard baryons-to-star conversion efficiency. Their bi-modal redshift probability distributions suggest they could also be $z<1.5$ dwarf galaxies with extreme dust extinction. We also identify a strong line emitter galaxy at $z \sim 5$ mimicking the near-infrared emission of a $z \sim 13$ galaxy. Our sample holds promising candidates for future follow-ups. Confirming ultra high-redshift galaxies or lower-z dusty dwarfs will offer valuable insights into early galaxy formation, evolution with their central black holes and the nature of dark matter, and/or cosmic dust production mechanisms in low-mass galaxies, and will help us to understand degeneracies and contamination in high-z object searches.         |

|**Abstract**|            The field of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) searches for ``technosignatures'' that could provide the first detection of life beyond Earth through the technology that an extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) may have created. Any given SETI survey, if no technosignatures are detected, should set upper limits based on the kinds of technosignatures it should have been able to detect; the sensitivity of many SETI searches requires that their target sources (e.g., Dyson spheres or Kardashev II/III level radio transmitters) emit with power far exceeding the kinds of technology humans have developed. In this paper, we instead turn our gaze Earthward, minimizing the axis of extrapolation by only considering transmission and detection methods commensurate with an Earth-2024 level. We evaluate the maximum distance of detectability for various present-day Earth technosignatures -- radio transmissions, atmospheric technosignatures, optical and infrared signatures, and objects in space or on planetary surfaces -- using only present-day Earth instruments, providing one of the first fully cross-wavelength comparisons of the growing toolbox of SETI techniques. In this framework, we find that Earth's space-detectable signatures span 13 orders of magnitude in detectability, with intermittent, celestially-targeted radio transmission (i.e., planetary radar) beating out its nearest non-radio competitor by a factor of $10^3$ in detection distance. This work highlights the growing range of ways that exoplanet technosignatures may be expressed, the growing complexity and visibility of the human impact upon our planet, and the continued importance of the radio frequencies in SETI.         |

|| W.-Y. Wang, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Liu</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            Frequency-dependent polarization properties provide crucial insights into the radiation mechanisms and magnetic environments of fast radio bursts (FRBs). We explore an analytical solution of radiative transfer of the polarization properties of FRBs as a strong incoming wave propagates in a homogeneous magnetized plasma. The case of a thermal plasma is studied in more detail. The rotational axis of the polarization spectrum undergoes precession with frequency on the Poincaré sphere when the medium has both strong Faraday rotation and conversion. Such precession on the Poincaré sphere could occur in hot or cold plasma with a strong magnetic field component perpendicular to the line of sight. The analytical solution with the mixing Faraday case offers a more physical description of the physical properties of the magnetic environment of FRBs than the empirical ``generalized Faraday rotation'' method commonly adopted in the literature. Significant absorption can exist in a dense plasma medium, which may give rise to a highly circularly polarized outgoing wave. The frequency-dependent Stokes parameters may be associated with reversing rotation measures or the presence of a persistent radio source around an FRB.         |

|| T.-H. Hsieh, et al. -- incl., <mark>C. Gieser</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            Context. Multiple systems are common in field stars, and the frequency is found to be higher in early evolutionary stages. Thus, the study of young multiple systems during the embedded stages is key to have a comprehensive understanding of star formation. In particular, how material accretes from the large-scale envelope into the inner region and how this flow interacts with the system physically and chemically has not yet been well characterized observationally. Aims. We aim to provide a snapshot of the forming protobinary system SVS13A, consisting of VLA4A and VLA4B. This includes clear pictures of its kinematic structures, physical conditions, and chemical properties. Methods. We conducted ALMA observations toward SVS13A targeting CH3CN and CH3-13CN J=12-11 K-ladder line emission with a high spatial resolution of ~30 au at a spectral resolution of ~0.08 km s-1 Results. We perform LTE radiative transfer models to fit the spectral features of the line emission. We find the two-layer LTE radiative model including dust absorption is essential to interpret the CH3CN and CH3-13-CN line emission. We identify two major and four small kinematic components, and derive their physical and chemical properties. Conclusions. We find a possible infalling signature toward the bursting secondary source VLA4A, which may be fed by an infalling streamer from the large-scale envelope. The mechanical heating in the binary system, as well as the infalling shocked gas, likely play a role in the thermal structure of the protobinary system. By accumulating mass from the streamer, the system might have experienced a gravitationally unstable phase before the accretion outburst. Finally, the derived CH3CN/CH3-13-CN ratio is lower than the canonical ratio in the ISM and is different between VLA4A and VLA4B.         |

|**Abstract**|            Ultra-light axions are hypothetical scalar particles that influence the evolution of large-scale structures of the Universe. Depending on their mass, they can potentially be part of the dark matter component of the Universe, as candidates commonly referred to as fuzzy dark matter. While strong constraints have been established for pure fuzzy dark matter models, the more general scenario where ultra-light axions constitute only a fraction of the dark matter has been limited to a few observational probes. In this work, we use the galaxy cluster number counts obtained from the first All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) of the SRG/eROSITA mission together with gravitational weak lensing data from the Dark Energy Survey, the Kilo-Degree Survey, and the Hyper Suprime-Cam, to constrain the fraction of ultra-light axions in the mass range $10^{-32}$ eV to $10^{-24}$ eV. We put upper bounds on the ultra-light axion relic density in independent logarithmic axion mass bins by performing a full cosmological parameter inference. We find an exclusion region in the intermediate ultra-light axion mass regime with the tightest bounds reported so far in the mass bins around $m_\mathrm{a}=10^{-27}$ eV with $\Omega_\mathrm{a} < 0.0036$ and $m_\mathrm{a}=10^{-26}$ eV with $\Omega_\mathrm{a} < 0.0084$, both at 95% confidence level. When combining with CMB probes, these bounds are tightened to $\Omega_\mathrm{a} < 0.0030$ in the $m_\mathrm{a}=10^{27}$ eV mass bin and $\Omega_\mathrm{a} < 0.0058$ in the $m_\mathrm{a}=10^{-26}$ eV mass bin, both at 95% confidence level. This is the first time that constraints on ultra-light axions have been obtained using the growth of structure measured by galaxy cluster number counts. These results pave the way for large surveys, which can be utilized to obtain tight constraints on the mass and relic density of ultra-light axions with better theoretical modeling of the abundance of halos.         |
