|**Abstract**|            The observed star formation rates of galaxies in the Local Universe suggests that they are replenishing their gas reservoir across cosmic time. Cosmological simulations predict that this accretion of fresh gas can occur in a hot or a cold mode, yet the existence of low column density ($\sim10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$) neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) tracing the cold mode has not been unambiguously confirmed by observations. We present the application of unconstrained spectral stacking to attempt to detect the emission from this HI in the Circum-Galactic Medium (CGM) and Inter-Galactic Medium (IGM) of 6 nearby star forming galaxies from the MHONGOOSE sample for which full-depth observations are available. Our stacking procedure consists of a standard spectral stacking algorithm coupled with a one-dimensional spectral line finder designed to extract reliable signal close to the noise level. In agreement with previous studies, we found that the amount of signal detected outside the HI disk is much smaller than implied by simulations. Furthermore, the column density limit that we achieve via stacking ($\sim10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$) suggests that direct detection of the neutral CGM/IGM component might be challenging in the future, even with the next generation of radio telescopes.         |

|**Abstract**|            Blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars are crucial for studying the structure of the Galactic halo. Accurate atmospheric parameters of BHB stars are essential for investigating the formation and evolution of the Galaxy. In this work, a data-driven technique named stellar label machine (SLAM) is used to estimate the atmospheric parameters of Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope low-resolution spectra (LAMOST-LRS) for BHB stars with a set of A-type theoretical spectra as the training dataset. We add color indexes ($(BP-G), (G-RP), (BP-RP), (J-H)$) during the training process to constrain the stellar temperature further. Finally, we derive the atmospheric parameters ($T_\mathrm{eff}$, log\, $g$, [Fe/H]) for 5,355 BHB stars. Compared to existing literature results, our results are more robust, after taking the color index into account, the resulted precisoin of $T_\mathrm{eff}$, log\, $g$ is significantly improved, especially for the spectrum with low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Based on the duplicate observations with a S/N difference $< 20\%$, the random errors are around 30\,K, 0.1~dex, and 0.12~dex for $T_\mathrm{eff}$, log\,$g$, [Fe/H], respectively. The stellar labels provided by SLAM are also compared to those from the high-resolution spectra in literature. The standard deviation between the predicted star labels and the published values from the high-resolution spectra is adopted as \sout{to} the statistical uncertainty of our results. They are $\sigma$($T_\mathrm{eff}$) = 76\,K, $\sigma$(log\,$g$) = 0.04~dex, and $\sigma$([Fe/H]) = 0.09~dex, respectively.         |
