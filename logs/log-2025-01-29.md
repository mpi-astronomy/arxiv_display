|**Abstract**|            The 2-point correlation function of the galaxy spatial distribution is a major cosmological observable that enables constraints on the dynamics and geometry of the Universe. The Euclid mission aims at performing an extensive spectroscopic survey of approximately 20--30 million H$\alpha$-emitting galaxies up to about redshift two. This ambitious project seeks to elucidate the nature of dark energy by mapping the 3-dimensional clustering of galaxies over a significant portion of the sky. This paper presents the methodology and software developed for estimating the 3-dimensional 2-point correlation function within the Euclid Science Ground Segment. The software is designed to overcome the significant challenges posed by the large and complex Euclid data set, which involves millions of galaxies. Key challenges include efficient pair counting, managing computational resources, and ensuring the accuracy of the correlation function estimation. The software leverages advanced algorithms, including kd-tree, octree, and linked-list data partitioning strategies, to optimise the pair-counting process. The implementation also includes parallel processing capabilities using shared-memory open multi-processing to further enhance performance and reduce computation times. Extensive validation and performance testing of the software are presented. The results indicate that the software is robust and can reliably estimate the 2-point correlation function, which is essential for deriving cosmological parameters with high precision. Furthermore, the paper discusses the expected performance of the software during different stages of the Euclid Wide Survey observations and forecasts how the precision of the correlation function measurements will improve over the mission's timeline, highlighting the software's capability to handle large data sets efficiently.         |

|**Abstract**|            Star formation has often been studied by separating the low- and high-mass regimes with an approximate boundary at 8M_sun. While some of the outcomes of the star-formation process are different between the two regimes, it is less clear whether the physical processes leading to these outcomes are that different at all. Here, we systematically compare low- and high-mass star formation by reviewing the most important processes and quantities from an observational and theoretical point of view. We identify three regimes where processes are either similar, quantitatively or qualitatively different between low- and high-mass star formation. Similar characteristics can be identified for the turbulent gas properties and density structures of the star-forming regions. Many of the observational characteristics also do not depend that strongly on the environment. Quantitative differences can be found for outflow, infall and accretion rates as well as mean column and volume densities. Also the multiplicity significantly rises from low- to high-mass stars. The importance of the magnetic field for the formation processes appears still less well constrained. Qualitative differences between low- and high-mass star formation relate mainly to the radiative and ionizing feedback that occurs almost exclusively in regions forming high-mass stars. Nevertheless, accretion apparently can continue via disk structures in ionized accretion flows. Finally, we discuss to what extent a unified picture of star formation over all masses is possible and which issues need to be addressed in the future.         |

|*Comments*| *To appear in the proceedings of IAU Symposium 395 (3 pages)*|
|**Abstract**|            We report the discovery of a peculiar set of old super-metal-rich dwarf stars with orbits of low eccentricity that reach a maximum height from the Galactic plane between $\sim$ 0.5-1.5 kpc observed by the \emph{Gaia}-ESO Survey. These stars show lithium (Li) depletion, which is anti-correlated with their [Fe/H]. To investigate these stars' chemo-dynamical properties, we used data from the \emph{Gaia}-ESO Survey. We applied hierarchical clustering to group the stars based on their abundances (excluding Li). Orbits were integrated using \emph{Gaia} astrometry and radial velocities from \emph{Gaia}-ESO. Our analysis suggests that the high metallicity of these stars is incompatible with their formation in the solar neighbourhood. We also found that their Li envelope abundance is below the benchmark meteoritic value, in agreement with previous works. This result supports the idea that the Li abundance in old, super-metal-rich dwarf stars should not be considered a proxy for the local interstellar medium Li.         |

|*Comments*| *12 pages, 7 figures, Accepted to be published in ApJ*|
|**Abstract**|            In this manuscript, properties of spectroscopic continuum emissions are considered to detect potential tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates among SDSS quasars. After considering the simple blackbody photosphere model applied to describe quasar continuum emissions with parameters of blackbody temperature $T_{BB}$ and blackbody radius $R_{BB}$, SDSS quasars and reported optical TDEs occupy distinct regions in the space of $T_{BB}$ and $R_{BB}$. Then, through the dependence of $R_{BB}$ on $T_{BB}$ for SDSS quasars, 402 outliers in SDSS Stripe82 region can be collected. Among the 402 outliers, the SDSS J2308 at $z=1.16$ is mainly considered, due to its SDSS spectrum observed around the peak brightness of the light curves. With the 7.2-year-long light curves described by theoretical TDE model, the determined $T_{BB}$ and $R_{BB}$ through its spectroscopic continuum emissions are consistent with the TDE model determined values, to support the central TDE. Moreover, considering simulated results on continuum emissions of SDSS quasars around $z\sim1.16$, confidence level higher than 4$\sigma$ can be confirmed that the continuum emissions of SDSS J2308 are not related to normal quasars. Furthermore, accepted CAR process to simulate intrinsic AGN variability, the confidence level higher than $3\sigma$ can be confirmed that the long-term light curves of SDSS J2308 are related to a central TDE. Jointed the probabilities through both spectroscopic and photometric simulations, the confidence level higher than $5\sigma$ can be confirmed to support the central TDE in SDSS J2308.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report the spectroscopic identification of three brown dwarf candidates -- o005_s41280, o006_s00089, and o006_s35616 -- discovered in the RUBIES using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) PRISM/CLEAR spectroscopy. We fit these sources with multiple substellar atmosphere models and present the atmospheric parameters, including effective temperature ($T_\mathrm{eff}$), surface gravity, and other derived properties. The results suggest that o005_s41280 and o006_s35616, with $T_\mathrm{eff}$ in the ranges of 2100--2300 K and 1800--2000 K, are likely L dwarfs, while o006_s00089, with $T_\mathrm{eff} < 1000$ K, is consistent with a late T dwarf classification. The best-fit model spectra provide a reasonable match to the observed spectra. However, distinct residuals exist in the $Y$, $J$, and $H$ bands for the two L dwarf candidates, particularly for o006_s35616. Incorporating the extinction parameter into the fitting process can significantly reduce these residuals. The distance estimates indicate that these candidates are about 2 kpc away. The analysis of the color-color diagram using multiple JWST NIRcam photometry suggests that cooler T dwarfs, such as o006_s00089, overlap with little red dots (LRDs), while hotter L dwarfs, like o005_s41280 and o006_s35616, tend to contaminate the high-redshift galaxy cluster. These findings suggest a brown dwarf contamination rate of approximately 0.1% in extragalactic deep field surveys, with L dwarfs being more frequently detected than cooler T and Y dwarfs.         |

|**Abstract**|            The dynamo theory has always been one of the biggest mysteries in stellar physics. One key reason for its uncertainty is poor knowledge of the dynamo process on stars except the Sun. The most important observation feature of solar dynamo is that active regions only appear at low latitudes, which provides a crucial constraint to the dynamo theory, while Doppler imaging, the current technique to spatially resolve stellar hemisphere, is difficult to distinguish the equatorial region . Hence, the latitudinal distribution of active regions (LDAR) of stars is ambiguous and controversial, mainly due to the limit of the current technique for spatially resolving the stellar surface. Fast rotating stars, which are young and active, are thought to operate with a different dynamo process than the Sun. We study their LDAR and compare them with the Sun to reveal the underlying dynamo process. Flares are drastic and observational activity events, which occur in active regions. Here, we propose a new method to study how the apparent flaring activity varies with respect to the inclination to determine the LDAR of fast rotating this http URL find that the LDAR of fast rotating stars is consistent with that of the Sun, contrary to expectations. Our results provide a crucial constraint to stellar dynamo, indicating that the solar-like dynamo also applies to fast rotating stars, even spanning different stages of their evolution.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report the observations of J=1-0 of HCN, HCO+, H13CO+, and H13CN, HC3N (J=11-10) emission towards 135 massive star-forming clumps, as part of the ATOMS (ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions) Survey. We present the integrated intensity probability distribution function for these molecular tracers, modeled as a combination of a log-normal distribution and a power-law tail. The molecular line luminosities for the power-law tail segment, Lmol(p), have been calculated. We have investigated the correlation between the bolometric luminosity, Lbol, and the power-law part of the molecular line luminosity, Lmol(p). Our findings suggest that the scaling relationships between Lbol and Lmol(p) for HCN and HCO+ are sublinear, indicating that these molecules might not be the most effective tracers for the dense gas. In contrast, H13CN and HC3N exhibit a nearly linear relationship between Lbol and Lmol(p), indicating that they can well trace gravitationally bound dense gas. The ratios of Lbol-to-Lmol(p), serving as indicators of star formation efficiency within massive star-forming clumps, exhibit a weak anti-correlation with the power-law index in the I-PDF. In addition, the star formation efficiency is also weakly anti-correlated with the exponent U of the corresponding equivalent density distribution. Our results implie that clumps with substantial gas accumulation may still display low star formation efficiencies.         |
