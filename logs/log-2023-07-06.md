|**Abstract**| We present the first results from the Revealing Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (ReveaLLAGN) survey, a JWST survey of seven nearby LLAGN. We focus on two observations with the Mid-Infrared Instrument's (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) of the nuclei of NGC 1052 and Sombrero (NGC 4594 / M104). We also compare these data to public JWST data of a higher-luminosity AGN, NGC 7319. JWST clearly resolves the AGN component even in Sombrero, the faintest target in our survey; the AGN components have very red spectra. We find that the emission-line widths in both NGC 1052 and Sombrero increase with increasing ionization potential, with FWHM > 1000 km/s for lines with ionization potential > 50 eV. These lines are also significantly blue-shifted in both LLAGN. The high ionization potential lines in NGC 7319 show neither broad widths or significant blue shifts. Many of the lower ionization potential emission lines in Sombrero show significant blue wings extending > 1000 km/s. These features and the emission-line maps in both galaxies are consistent with outflows along the jet direction. Sombrero has the lowest luminosity high-ionization potential lines ([Ne V] and [O IV]) ever measured in the mid-IR, but the relative strengths of these lines are consistent with higher luminosity AGN. On the other hand, the [Ne V] emission is much weaker relative to the [Ne III}] and [Ne II] lines of higher-luminosity AGN. These initial results show the great promise that JWST holds for identifying and studying the physical nature of LLAGN. |

|**Abstract**| The Astro2020 Decadal Survey has identified the mapping of the circumgalactic medium (CGM, gaseous plasma around galaxies) as a key objective. We explore the prospects for characterizing the CGM in and around nearby galaxy halos with future large grasp X-ray microcalorimeters. We create realistic mock observations from hydrodynamical simulations (EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Simba) that demonstrate a wide range of potential measurements, which will address the open questions in galaxy formation and evolution. By including all background and foreground components in our mock observations, we show why it is impossible to perform these measurements with current instruments, such as X-ray CCDs, and only microcalorimeters will allow us to distinguish the faint CGM emission from the bright Milky Way (MW) foreground emission lines. We find that individual halos of MW mass can, on average, be traced out to large radii, around R500, and for larger galaxies even out to R200, using the OVII, OVIII, or FeXVII emission lines. Furthermore, we show that emission line ratios for individual halos can reveal the radial temperature structure. Substructure measurements show that it will be possible to relate azimuthal variations to the feedback mode of the galaxy. We demonstrate the ability to construct temperature, velocity, and abundance ratio maps from spectral fitting for individual galaxy halos, which reveal rotation features, AGN outbursts, and enrichment. |

|**Abstract**| The hot, X-ray-emitting phase of the circumgalactic medium in galaxies is believed to be the reservoir of baryons from which gas flows onto the central galaxy and into which feedback from AGN and stars inject mass, momentum, energy, and metals. These effects shape the velocity fields of the hot gas, which can be observed by X-ray IFUs via the Doppler shifting and broadening of emission lines. In this work, we analyze the gas kinematics of the hot circumgalactic medium of Milky Way-mass disk galaxies from the TNG50 simulation with synthetic observations to determine how future instruments can probe this velocity structure. We find that the hot phase is often characterized by outflows outward from the disk driven by feedback processes, radial inflows near the galactic plane, and rotation, though in other cases the velocity field is more disorganized and turbulent. With a spectral resolution of $\sim$1 eV, fast and hot outflows ($\sim$200-500 km s$^{-1}$) can be measured, depending on the orientation of the galaxy on the sky. The rotation velocity of the hot phase ($\sim$100-200 km s$^{-1}$) can be measured using line shifts in edge-on galaxies, and is slower than that of colder gas phases but similar to stellar rotation velocities. By contrast, the slow inflows ($\sim$50-100 km s$^{-1}$) are difficult to measure in projection with these other components. We find that the velocity measured is sensitive to which emission lines are used. Measuring these flows will help constrain theories of how the gas in these galaxies forms and evolves. |

|**Abstract**| We derive predictions from state-of-the-art cosmological galaxy simulations for the spatial distribution of the hot circumgalactic medium (CGM, ${\rm [0.1-1]R_{200c}}$) through its emission lines in the X-ray soft band ($[0.3-1.3]$ keV). In particular, we compare IllustrisTNG, EAGLE, and SIMBA and focus on galaxies with stellar mass $10^{10-11.6}\, \MSUN$ at $z=0$. The three simulation models return significantly different surface brightness radial profiles of prominent emission lines from ionized metals such as OVII(f), OVIII, and FeXVII as a function of galaxy mass. Likewise, the three simulations predict varying azimuthal distributions of line emission with respect to the galactic stellar planes, with IllustrisTNG predicting the strongest angular modulation of CGM physical properties at radial range ${\gtrsim0.3-0.5\,R_{200c}}$. This anisotropic signal is more prominent for higher-energy lines, where it can manifest as X-ray eROSITA-like bubbles. Despite different models of stellar and supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback, the three simulations consistently predict a dichotomy between star-forming and quiescent galaxies at the Milky-Way and Andromeda mass range, where the former are X-ray brighter than the latter. This is a signature of SMBH-driven outflows, which are responsible for quenching star formation. Finally, we explore the prospect of testing these predictions with a microcalorimeter-based X-ray mission concept with a large field-of-view. Such a mission would probe the extended hot CGM via soft X-ray line emission, determine the physical properties of the CGM, including temperature, from the measurement of line ratios, and provide critical constraints on the efficiency and impact of SMBH feedback on the CGM. |

|**Abstract**| We present a forecast of the cosmological parameter estimation using fast radio bursts (FRBs) from the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA), focusing on the issues of dark energy, the Hubble constant, and baryon density. We simulate $10^5$ and $10^6$ localized FRBs from a 10-year SKA observation, and find that: (i) using $10^6$ FRB data alone can tightly constrain dark-energy equation of state parameters better than CMB+BAO+SN, providing a single cosmological probe to explore dark energy; (ii) combining the FRB data with gravitational wave standard siren data from 10-year observation with the Einstein Telescope, the Hubble constant can be constrained to a sub-percent level, serving as a powerful low-redshift probe; (iii) using $10^6$ FRB data can constrain the baryon density $\Omega_{\rm b}h$ to a precision of $\sim 0.1\%$. Our results indicate that SKA-era FRBs will provide precise cosmological measurements to shed light on both dark energy and the missing baryon problem, and help resolve the Hubble tension. |

|**Abstract**| Taiji program is a space mission aiming to detect gravitational waves in the low frequency band. Taiji-1 is the first technology demonstration satellite of the Taiji Program in Space, with the gravitational reference sensor (GRS) serving as one of its key scientific payloads. For accurate accelerometer measurements, the test-mass center of the GRS must be positioned precisely at the center of gravity of the satellite to avoid measurement disturbances caused by angular acceleration and gradient. Due to installation and measurement errors, fuel consumption during in-flight phase, and other factors, the offset between the test-mass center and the center-of-mass (COM) of the satellite can be significant, degrading the measurement accuracy of the accelerometer. Therefore, the offset needs to be estimated and controlled within the required range by the center-of-mass adjustment mechanism during the satellite's lifetime. In this paper, we present a novel method, the Extended Kalman Filter combined with Rauch-Tung-Striebel Smoother, to estimate the offset, while utilizing the chi-square test to eliminate outliers. Additionally, the nonlinear Least Squares estimation algorithm is employed as a crosscheck to estimate the offset of COM. The two methods are shown to give consistent results, with the offset estimated to be $dx \approx $$-$$0.19$ mm, $dy \approx 0.64$ mm, and $dz \approx $$-$$0.82$ mm. The results indicate a significant improvement on the noise level of GRS after the COM calibration, which will be of great help for the future Taiji program. |
