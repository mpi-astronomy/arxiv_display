|**Abstract**|            We introduce a new photometric catalog of RR Lyrae variables (RRLs, $\sim$300,000) mainly based on data available in public datasets. We also present the largest and most homogeneous spectroscopic dataset of RRLs and Blue Horizontal Branch [BHB] stars ever collected. This includes radial velocity measurements ($\sim$16,000) and iron abundances ($\Delta$S method for 8,140 RRLs, plus 547 from literature). Elemental abundances based on high-resolution spectra are provided for 487 RRLs and 64 BHB stars. We identified candidate RRLs associated to the main Galactic components and their iron distribution function (IDF) becomes more metal-rich when moving from the Halo ([Fe/H]=-1.56) to the Thick (TCD; [Fe/H]=-1.47) and Thin (TND; [Fe/H]=-0.73) disk. Furthermore, Halo RRLs and RRLs in retrograde orbits are $\alpha$-enhanced ([$\alpha$/Fe]=0.27, $\sigma$=0.18), while TCD RRLs are either $\alpha$-enhanced ([Fe/H]$\le$-1.0) or $\alpha$-poor ([Fe/H]$>$-1.0), and TND RRLs are mainly $\alpha$-poor ([$\alpha$/Fe]=-0.01, $\sigma$=0.20). We also identified RRLs associated to the main stellar streams (Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus [GSE]; Sequoia, Helmi, Sagittarius) and we found that their IDFs are quite similar to Halo RRLs. However, GSE RRLs lack the metal-poor/metal-rich tails and their $\alpha$-element distribution is quite compact. The iron radial gradient in Galactocentric distance for TND, TCD and Halo RRLs is negative and it decreases from -0.026, to -0.010, and to -0.002 dex/kpc. The iron radial gradient based on dry Halo (Halo without substructures) RRLs is, within the errors, equal to the global Halo. We also found a strong similarity between iron and [$\alpha$/Fe] radial gradients of Milky Way RRLs and M31 globular clusters throughout the full range of galactocentric distances covered by the two samples.         |

|| K. Goold, et al. -- incl., <mark>A. Dumont</mark>, <mark>N. Neumayer</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-01-26*|
|*Comments*| *Submitted to The Astrophysical Journal; under review after addressing referee comments. 25 pages, 10 figures*|
|**Abstract**|            We present near- and mid-infrared spectra of eight Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGN), spanning nearly four orders of magnitude in black hole mass and Eddington ratio, obtained with JWST/NIRSpec and MIRI as part of the ReveaLLAGN program along with identical archival data of Cen A. The high spatial resolution of JWST cleanly separates AGN emission from host-galaxy contamination, enabling detections of high-ionization potential lines more than an order of magnitude fainter than previously measured. Emission-line diagnostics reveal a transition at log($L_{bol}/L_{Edd}$) ~ -3.5, where the spectral energy distribution becomes increasingly deficient in ultraviolet photons. We find that rotational H$_2$ excitation temperatures are elevated (~500 K higher) compared to both higher-luminosity AGN and star-forming galaxies, while the H$_2$(0-0)S(3)/PAH$_{11.3 \mu m}$ ratios are consistent with those observed in the AGN population. We discuss the possible roles of outflows, jets, and X-ray dominated regions in shaping the interstellar medium surrounding LLAGN. Silicate emission at ~10 $\mu$m, localized to the nuclear region, is detected in most ReveaLLAGN targets. This dataset offers the first comprehensive JWST-based characterization of infrared emission lines in the nuclear regions of LLAGN.         |

|| R. J. v. Weeren, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-01-26*|
|*Comments*| *22 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**|            Giant radio haloes are diffuse synchrotron sources typically found in merging galaxy clusters, while smaller mini-haloes occur in cool-core clusters. Both trace cosmic-ray electrons in the intracluster medium, though recent observations suggest their distinction is not always clear. We present new 903-1655 MHz MeerKAT observations of Abell 1775 and Abell 1795, both hosting cool cores and cold fronts. Combined with reprocessed 120-168 MHz LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey data, we perform imaging and spectral analyses of their radio emission. In both clusters, we detect radio haloes with distinct inner and outer components. In Abell 1775, the halo appears diffuse at 1.3 GHz, while LOFAR images reveal steep-spectrum filaments. In Abell 1795, the inner component corresponds to a previously reported mini-halo candidate, but the full structure extends to $\sim$1 Mpc with a spectral index of $\alpha=-1.08\pm0.06$. The presence of such a large, flat-spectrum halo in a dynamically relaxed cluster makes Abell 1795 an outlier relative to typical merging systems. This suggests that some relaxed clusters may still retain sufficient turbulence to sustain particle re-acceleration, or that hadronic interactions producing secondary electrons play a significant role. Together with other recent discoveries in cool-core systems, our results indicate that some large radio haloes may have been overlooked in past studies due to limited dynamic range near bright central AGN. Finally, we detect steep-spectrum emission south of Abell 1795's central AGN, tracing a 45 kpc X-ray and optical filament that terminates in an X-ray cavity, likely linked to a past AGN outburst.         |

|| F. Beutler, et al. -- incl., <mark>Y. Wang</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-01-26*|

|**Abstract**|            Understanding the Universe's origins and evolution remains one of the most fundamental challenges in modern cosmology. This white paper explores three key science priorities in this field: unravelling the physics of cosmic inflation, investigating the accelerating expansion of the Universe, and precisely measuring the sum of the neutrino masses. Achieving these goals requires a dedicated survey to map the large-scale structure at high redshift in unprecedented detail. We describe how this can be achieved through a mission concept called SIRMOS, providing a high-throughput, highly multiplexed spectroscopic capability to obtain accurate redshifts for over 100 million galaxies over a wide sky area. Such a survey would leverage the deepest existing wide-area photometric catalogues for targeting, with spectra offering continuous 1.25-2.5~$\mu$m wavelength coverage at moderate resolution, allowing precise redshift measurements in the $1<z<4$ range with minimal bias. We outline the scientific opportunities this presents. Recent years have seen significant advances in instrumentation, including digital micromirror devices, complex telescope mirrors, large detector arrays, and data processing pipelines. While these technologies have been demonstrated in terrestrial applications, such a survey is a unique opportunity to apply these proven capabilities in space to address fundamental questions in cosmology. Participation in such a mission will simultaneously deliver a compelling science case, help align UK Space Agency and STFC strategies, demonstrate the UK's growing capability in end-to-end space missions, and strengthen the national space economy through high-value industrial participation.         |

|| A. Bieryla, et al. -- incl., <mark>T. Henning</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2026-01-26*|
|*Comments*| *13 pages, 9 figures, accepted 22 Jan 2026*|
|**Abstract**|            We report the discovery and characterization of TOI-6692 b, an eccentric (e~0.54) Jupiter on a 130-day orbit. TOI-6692 b was first detected as a community TESS Object of Interest (cTOI) by the Visual Survey Group and the Planet Hunters group as a single transit candidate via TESS observation. The period was subsequently confirmed via radial velocity monitoring from the Planet Finder Spectrograph on the 6.5m Magellan telescope. Additional radial velocities were acquired with the CHIRON, FEROS, and CORALIE spectrographs. LCOGT ground-based photometric follow-up was conducted over 2 weeks to detect another transit and refine the period. Although we did not detect an ingress or egress of the 11.04 hr transit, we did detect a possible in-transit signal in the multi-night data and provide an updated ephemeris for future monitoring. TOI-6692 b is one of few planets with orbital periods longer than 100 days that have a secure mass, radius, and eccentricity detection. As with most giant planets at these orbital periods, the eccentricity of TOI-6692 b is lower than that expected of planets undergoing high-eccentricity tidal migration, but is more consistent with the expectations of planet-planet scattering outcomes. A long-term radial velocity trend was detected and further monitoring is warranted to determine the outer companion period. TOI-6692 b is also one of few TESS single transit targets that have its period eventually confirmed via follow-up photometric campaigns timed to capture transits despite the relatively large ephemeris uncertainties. Such efforts highlight the capabilities of night-to-night stability on ground-based photometric facilities today.         |
