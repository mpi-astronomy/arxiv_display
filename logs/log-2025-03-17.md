|**Abstract**|            With about 1.5 billion galaxies expected to be observed, the very large number of objects in the \textit{Euclid}\xspace photometric survey will allow for precise studies of galaxy clustering from a single survey, over a large range of redshifts $0.2 < z < 2.5$. In this work, we use photometric redshifts to extract the baryon acoustic oscillation signal (BAO) from the Flagship galaxy mock catalogue with a tomographic approach to constrain the evolution of the Universe and infer its cosmological parameters. We measure the two-point angular correlation function in 13 redshift bins. A template-fitting approach is applied to the measurement to extract the shift of the BAO peak through the transverse Alcock--Paczynski parameter $\alpha$. A joint analysis of all redshift bins is performed to constrain $\alpha$ at the effective redshift $z_\mathrm{eff}=0.77$ with MCMC and profile likelihood techniques. We also extract one $\alpha_i$ parameter per redshift bin to quantify its evolution as a function of time. From these 13 $\alpha_i$, which are directly proportional to the ratio $D_\mathrm{A}/\,r_\mathrm{s,\,drag}$, we constrain $h$, $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$, and $\Omega_\mathrm{cdm}$. From the joint analysis, we constrain $\alpha(z_\mathrm{eff}=0.77)=1.0011^{+0.0078}_{-0.0079}$, which represents a three-fold improvement over current constraints from the Dark Energy Survey. As expected, the constraining power in the analysis of each redshift bin is lower, with an uncertainty ranging from $\pm\,0.13$ to $\pm\,0.024$. From these results, we constrain $h$ at 0.45 %, $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$ at 0.91 %, and $\Omega_\mathrm{cdm}$ at 7.7 %. We quantify the influence of analysis choices like the template, scale cuts, redshift bins, and systematic effects like redshift-space distortions over our constraints both at the level of the extracted $\alpha_i$ parameters and at the level of cosmological inference.         |

|**Abstract**|            Aims. Asteroseismic radius and Gaia distance (ARD) method has been proposed to establish the SBCRs for late-type stars. Methods. We select Kepler RGB stars with high-precision asteroseismic radii (uncertainties < 1%) and cross-match them with 2MASS, APASS, and Gaia to obtain Johnson-B, Johnson-V, G, J, H, and Ks-band photometric data. After applying selection criteria, we obtain 626 RGB stars to build the SBCR. Among these, 100 RGBs are used as independent validation for the distance, and the remaining samples are used to fit the SBCR. Results. First, using 526 targets with asteroseismic radii and Gaia distances, nine SBCRs are proposed based on 2MASS (J, H, Ks), APASS (Johnson-B, Johnson-V), and Gaia (G) photometry. The average rms scatter in these relations is 0.075 mag, which corresponds to an uncertainty of approximately 3.5% in distance. These relations are further validated using 100 independent samples with Gaia distances, showing no bias, with a dispersion of approximately 3%. Compared to interferometric measurements, a systematic underestimation of 2.3% was observed, and the discrepancy decreases as the angular diameter increases. Additionally, the distances of eclipsing binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud and Small Magellanic Cloud obtained using our SBCRs are generally consistent with those measured in the literature, with a dispersion of 1% and a slight overestimation of 1% to 2.5%. Conclusions. The ARD method capitalizes on two key advantages for precise stellar distance determination: a statistically robust sample of homogeneous RGB stars with low observational costs, and independent distance verification through Gaia data. Such SBCRs can be further calibrated and expanded more efficiently and effectively.         |

|**Abstract**|            Strong magnetic fields in the core of red-giant branch stars are expected to suppress the amplitudes of the multipole modes. This occurs when the strength of the internal magnetic field approaches the critical field strength, at which the magnetic forces become comparable to the buoyancy. We performed Hamiltonian ray tracing simulations of magneto-gravity waves to investigate the suppression of the multipole modes in the presence of an internal dipole-like magnetic field. We took into account different stellar masses, metallicities, and ages, as well as various oscillation frequencies and spherical degrees. In particular, we estimated the trapped fraction, a measure of multipole mode suppression, which quantifies the fraction of mode energy in the core that is dissipated by the interaction with the magnetic field. Our results indicate that the trapped fraction can be described by a simple expression, which smoothly connects the regime without multipole mode suppression with the regime with complete suppression of the multipole modes. Crucially, the trapped fraction depends only on the ratio between the strength of the internal magnetic field and the critical field strength. Therefore, our expression for the trapped fraction provides a flexible tool that can be used, for example, to estimate the amount of multipole mode suppression as a star ascends the red-giant branch or to investigate the onset of the suppression in observed power spectral densities.         |
