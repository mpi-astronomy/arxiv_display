|**Abstract**| The magnetic processes associated with the non-thermal broadening of optically thin emission lines appear to carry enough energy to heat the corona and accelerate the solar wind. We investigate whether non-thermal motions in cool stars exhibit the same behaviour as on the Sun by analysing archival stellar spectra taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, and full-disc Solar spectra taken by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph. We determined the non-thermal velocities by measuring the excess broadening in optically thin emission lines formed in the stellar atmosphere; the chromosphere, the transition region and the corona. Assuming the non-thermal broadening is caused by the presence of Alfv\'en waves, we also determined the associated wave energy densities. Our results show that, with a non-thermal velocity of $\sim$23 kms$^{-1}$ the Sun-as-a-star results are in very good agreement with values obtained from spatially-resolved solar observations. The non-thermal broadening in our sample show correlation to stellar rotation, with the strength of the non-thermal velocity decreasing with decreasing rotation rate. Finally, the non-thermal velocity in cool Sun-like stars varies with atmospheric height or temperature of the emission lines, and peaks at transition region temperatures. This points towards a solar-like Alfv\'en wave driven heating in stellar atmospheres. However, the peak is at a lower temperature in some cool stars suggesting that, other magnetic process such as flaring events could also dominate. |

|**Abstract**| We report the methods of and initial scientific inferences from the extraction of precision photometric information for the $>800$ trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) discovered in the images of the Dark Energy Survey (DES). Scene-modelling photometry is used to obtain shot-noise-limited flux measures for each exposure of each TNO, with background sources subtracted. Comparison of double-source fits to the pixel data with single-source fits are used to identify and characterize two binary TNO systems. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo method samples the joint likelihood of the intrinsic colors of each source as well as the amplitude of its flux variation, given the time series of multiband flux measurements and their uncertainties. A catalog of these colors and light curve amplitudes $A$ is included with this publication. We show how to assign a likelihood to the distribution $q(A)$ of light curve amplitudes in any subpopulation. Using this method, we find decisive evidence (i.e. evidence ratio $<0.01$) that cold classical (CC) TNOs with absolute magnitude $6<H_r<8.2$ are more variable than the hot classical (HC) population of the same $H_r$, reinforcing theories that the former form in situ and the latter arise from a different physical population. Resonant and scattering TNOs in this $H_r$ range have variability consistent with either the HC's or CC's. DES TNOs with $H_r<6$ are seen to be decisively less variable than higher-$H_r$ members of any dynamical group, as expected. More surprising is that detached TNOs are decisively less variable than scattering TNOs, which requires them to have distinct source regions or some subsequent differential processing. |

|| C. Han, et al. -- incl., <mark>A. Gould</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2023-04-07*|

|**Abstract**| We investigate the data collected by the high-cadence microlensing surveys during the 2022 season in search for planetary signals appearing in the light curves of microlensing events. From this search, we find that the lensing event MOA-2022-BLG-249 exhibits a brief positive anomaly that lasted for about 1 day with a maximum deviation of $\sim 0.2$~mag from a single-source single-lens model. We analyze the light curve under the two interpretations of the anomaly: one originated by a low-mass companion to the lens (planetary model) and the other originated by a faint companion to the source (binary-source model). It is found that the anomaly is better explained by the planetary model than the binary-source model. We identify two solutions rooted in the inner--outer degeneracy, for both of which the estimated planet-to-host mass ratio, $q\sim 8\times 10^{-5}$, is very small. With the constraints provided by the microlens parallax and the lower limit on the Einstein radius, as well as the blend-flux constraint, we find that the lens is a planetary system, in which a super-Earth planet, with a mass $(4.83\pm 1.44)~M_\oplus$, orbits a low-mass host star, with a mass $(0.18\pm 0.05)~M_\odot$, lying in the Galactic disk at a distance $(2.00\pm 0.42)$~kpc. The planet detection demonstrates the elevated microlensing sensitivity of the current high-cadence lensing surveys to low-mass planets. |
