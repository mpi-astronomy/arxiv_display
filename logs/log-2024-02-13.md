|**Abstract**| High-redshift quasars are thought to live in the densest regions of space which should be made evident by an overdensity of galaxies around them. However, campaigns to identify these overdensities through the search of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) and Lyman $\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) have had mixed results. These may be explained by either the small field of view of some of the experiments, the broad redshift ranges targeted by LBG searches, and by the inherent large uncertainty of quasar redshifts estimated from UV emission lines, which makes it difficult to place the Ly-$\alpha$ emission line within a narrowband filter. Here we present a three square degree search ($\sim 1000$ pMpc) for LAEs around the $z=6.9$ quasar VIKJ2348-3054 using the Dark Energy CAMera (DECam), housed on the 4m Blanco telescope, finding 38 LAEs. The systemic redshift of VIK J2348--3054 is known from ALMA [CII] observations and place the Ly-$\alpha$ emission line of companions within the NB964 narrowband of DECam. This is the largest field of view LAE search around a $z>6$ quasar conducted to date. We find that this field is $\sim$ 10 times more overdense when compared to the Chandra Deep-Field South, observed previously with the same instrumental setup as well as several combined blank fields. This is strong evidence that VIKJ2348-3054 resides in an overdensity of LAEs over several Mpc. Surprisingly, we find a lack of LAEs within 5 physical Mpc of the quasar and take this to most likely be evidence of the quasar suppressing star formation in its immediate vicinity. This result highlights the importance of performing overdensity searches over large areas to properly assess the density of those regions of the Universe. |

|**Abstract**| We report discovery and characterization of a main-sequence G star orbiting a dark object with mass $1.90\pm 0.04\,M_{\odot}$. The system was discovered via Gaia astrometry and has an orbital period of 731 days. We obtained multi-epoch RV follow-up over a period of 600 days, allowing us to refine the Gaia orbital solution and precisely constrain the masses of both components. The luminous star is a $\gtrsim 12$ Gyr-old, low-metallicity halo star near the main-sequence turnoff ($T_{\rm eff} \approx 6000$ K; $\log\left(g/\left[{\rm cm\,s^{-2}}\right]\right)\approx 4.0; \rm [Fe/H]\approx-1.25$; $M\approx0.79\,M_{\odot}$) with a highly enhanced lithium abundance. The RV mass function sets a minimum companion mass for an edge-on orbit of $M_2 > 1.67\,M_{\odot}$, well above the Chandrasekhar limit. The Gaia inclination constraint, $i=68.8\pm 1.4$ deg, then implies a companion mass of $M_2= 1.90\pm 0.04\,M_{\odot}$. The companion is most likely a massive neutron star: the only viable alternative is two massive white dwarfs in a close binary, but this scenario is disfavored on evolutionary grounds. The system's low eccentricity ($e=0.122\pm 0.003$) disfavors dynamical formation channels and implies that the neutron star formed with very little mass loss ($\lesssim 1\,M_{\odot}$) and with a weak natal kick ($v_{\rm kick}\lesssim 10\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$). The current orbit is too small to have accommodated the neutron star progenitor as a red supergiant or super-AGB star. The simplest formation scenario -- isolated binary evolution -- requires the system to have survived stable mass transfer or common envelope evolution with a donor-to-accretor mass ratio $>10$. The system, which we call Gaia NS1, is likely a progenitor of symbiotic X-ray binaries and long-period millisecond pulsars. Its discovery challenges binary evolution models and bodes well for Gaia's census of compact objects in wide binarie |
