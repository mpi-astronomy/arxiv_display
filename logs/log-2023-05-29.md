|**Abstract**| The combined fit of the measured energy spectrum and shower maximum depth distributions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays is known to constrain the parameters of astrophysical models with homogeneous source distributions. Studies of the distribution of the cosmic-ray arrival directions show a better agreement with models in which a fraction of the flux is non-isotropic and associated with the nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A or with catalogs such as that of starburst galaxies. Here, we present a novel combination of both analyses by a simultaneous fit of arrival directions, energy spectrum, and composition data measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory. We find that a model containing a flux contribution from the starburst galaxy catalog of around 20% at 40 EeV with a magnetic field blurring of around $20^\circ$ for a rigidity of 10 EV provides a fair simultaneous description of all three observables. The starburst galaxy model is favored with a significance of $4.5\sigma$ (considering experimental systematic effects) compared to a reference model with only homogeneously distributed background sources. By investigating a scenario with Centaurus A as a single source in combination with the homogeneous background, we confirm that this region of the sky provides the dominant contribution to the observed anisotropy signal. Models containing a catalog of jetted active galactic nuclei whose flux scales with the $\gamma$-ray emission are, however, disfavored as they cannot adequately describe the measured arrival directions. |

|**Abstract**| Timing observations are crucial for determining the physical properties of newly discovered pulsars. Using the L-band 19-beam receiver of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), the FAST Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot (GPPS) survey has discovered many faint and weak pulsars, which are hardly detected using other radio telescopes in limited observation time. To obtain accurate position, spin parameters, dispersion measure, and to calculate derived parameters such as characteristic age and surface magnetic fields, we collect available FAST pulsar data obtained either through targeted following-up observations or coincidental survey observations with one of the 19 beams of the L-band 19-beam receiver. From these data we get the time of arrival (TOA) measurements for 30 newly discovered pulsars as well as 13 known pulsars. We demonstrate that TOA measurements from any beams of the L-band 19-beam receiver acquired through any FAST observation mode (e.g., the tracking mode or the snapshot mode) can be combined together for getting timing solutions. We update the ephemeris of 13 previously known pulsars and obtained the first phase-coherent timing results for 30 isolated pulsars discovered in the FAST GPPS survey. Notably, PSR J1904+0853 is an isolated millisecond pulsar, PSR J1906+0757 is a disrupted recycled pulsar, and PSR J1856+0211 is a long-period pulsar that can constrain pulsar death lines. Based on these timing solutions, all available FAST data can be added together to get the best pulse profiles. |
