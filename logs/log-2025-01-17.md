|**Abstract**|            We confirm the planetary nature of a pair of transiting sub-Neptune exoplanets orbiting the bright F-type sub-giant star TOI-6054 ($V=8.02$, $K=6.673$) as a part of the OrCAS radial velocity survey using WIYN/NEID observations. We find that TOI-6054b and TOI-6054c have radii of $2.65 \pm 0.15$ $R_{\oplus}$ and $2.81 \pm 0.18$ $R_{\oplus}$, respectively, and masses of $12.4 \pm 1.7$ $M_{\oplus}$ and $9.2 \pm 2.0$ $M_{\oplus}$. The planets have zero-albedo equilibrium temperatures of $1360 \pm 33$ K and $1144 \pm 28$ K. The host star has expanded and will evolve off of the Main Sequence within the next $\sim$500 Myr, and the resulting increase in stellar luminosity has more than doubled the stellar flux the two planets receive compared to the start of the host star's main sequence phase. Consequently, TOI-6054b may be losing some of its primordial H/He atmosphere -- if it has one. Based on dynamical simulations performed using the orbital parameters of the two planets, TOI-6054b, and TOI-6054c are very likely in a 5:3 mean motion resonance. The TOI-6054 system thus has the potential to be an excellent candidate for future atmospheric follow-up observations, with two similarly sized sub-Neptunes around a bright star. We also estimate that if TOI-6054b is currently losing its H/He atmosphere this should be observable from space and from the ground.         |

|**Abstract**|            In recent years, numerical simulations have become indispensable for addressing complex astrophysical problems. The MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) framework represents a key tool for investigating the dynamical evolution of astrophysical plasmas, which are described as a set of partial differential equations that enforce the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, along with Maxwell's equation for the evolution of the electromagnetic fields. Due to the high nonlinearity of the MHD equations (regardless of their specifications, e.g., classical/relativistic or ideal/resistive), a general analytical solution is precluded, making the numerical approach crucial. Numerical simulations usually end up producing large sets of data files and their scientific analysis leans on dedicated software designed for data visualization. However, in order to encompass all of the code output features, specialized tools focusing on the numerical code may represent a more versatile and built-in tool. Here, we present PyPLUTO, a Python package tailored for efficient loading, manipulation, and visualization of outputs produced with the PLUTO code (Mignone et al., 2007; Mignone et al., 2012). PyPLUTO uses memory mapping to optimize data loading and provides general routines for data manipulation and visualization. PyPLUTO also supports the particle modules of the PLUTO code, enabling users to load and visualize particles, such as cosmic rays (Mignone et al., 2018), Lagrangian (Vaidya et al., 2018), or dust (Mignone et al., 2019) particles, from hybrid simulations. A dedicated Graphical User Interface (GUI) simplifies the generation of single-subplot figures, making PyPLUTO a powerful yet user-friendly toolkit for astrophysical data analysis.         |
