|**Abstract**|            Motivated by the vast gap between photometric and spectroscopic data volumes, there is great potential in using 5D kinematic information to identify and study substructures of the Milky Way. We identify substructures in the Galactic halo using 46,575 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) from Gaia DR3 with the photometric metallicities and distances newly estimated by Li et al. (2023). Assuming a Gaussian prior distribution of radial velocity, we calculate the orbital distribution characterized by the integrals of motion for each RRL based on its 3D positions, proper motions and corresponding errors, and then apply the friends-of-friends algorithm to identify groups moving along similar orbits. We have identified several known substructures, including Sagittarius (Sgr) Stream, Hercules-Aquila Cloud (HAC), Virgo Overdensity (VOD), Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES), Orphan-Chenab stream, Cetus-Palca, Helmi Streams, Sequoia, Wukong and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) leading arm, along with 18 unknown groups. Our findings indicate that HAC and VOD have kinematic and chemical properties remarkably similar to GES, with most HAC and VOD members exhibiting eccentricity as high as GES, suggesting that they may share a common origin with GES. The ability to identify the low mass and spatially dispersed substructures further demonstrates the potential of our method, which breaks the limit of spectroscopic survey and is competent to probe the substructures in the whole Galaxy. Finally, we have also identified 18 unknown groups with good spatial clustering and proper motion consistency, suggesting more excavation of Milky Way substructures in the future with only 5D data.         |

|**Abstract**|            The magnetic dynamo mechanism of giant stars remains an open question, which can be explored by investigating their activity-rotation relations with multiple proxies. By using the data from the LAMOST and \emph{GALEX} surveys, we carried out a comprehensive study of activity-rotation relations of evolved stars based on \cahk lines, $\rm{H\alpha}$ lines and near ultraviolet (NUV) emissions. Our results show that evolved stars and dwarfs obey a similar power-law in the unsaturated region of the activity-rotation relation, indicating a common dynamo mechanism in both giant and dwarfs. There is no clear difference in the activity levels between red giant branch stars and red clump stars, nor between single giants and those in binaries. Additionally, our results show that the NUV activity levels of giants are comparable to those of G- and K-type dwarfs and are higher than those of M dwarfs.         |

|| T. Sun, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Shi</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            This study investigates the temporal and spatial variations in lithium abundance within the Milky Way using a sample of 22,034 main-sequence turn-off (MSTO) stars and subgiants, characterised by precise stellar ages, 3D NLTE (non-local thermodynamic equilibrium) lithium abundances, and birth radii. Our results reveal a complex variation in lithium abundance with stellar age: a gradual increase from 14 Gyr to 6 Gyr, followed by a decline between 6 Gyr and 4.5 Gyr, and a rapid increase thereafter. We find that young Li-rich stars (ages $<$ 4 Gyr, A(Li) $>$ 2.7 dex) predominantly originate from the outer disc. By binning the sample according to guiding center radius and z$_{\rm max}$, we observe that these young Li-rich stars migrate radially to the local and inner discs. In addition, the stars originating from the inner disc experienced a rapid Li enrichment process between 8 Gyr and 6 Gyr. Our analysis suggests that the age range of Li-dip stars is 4-5 Gyr, encompassing evolution stages from MSTO stars to subgiants. The Galactic radial profile of A(Li) (with respect to birth radius), as a function of age, reveals three distinct periods: 14-6 Gyr ago, 6-4 Gyr ago, and 4-1 Gyr ago. Initially, the lithium abundance gradient is positive, indicating increasing Li abundance with birth radius. During the second period, it transitions to a negative and broken gradient, mainly affected by Li-dip stars. In the final period, the gradient reverts to a positive trend.         |

|**Abstract**|            The typically large distances, extinction, and crowding of Galactic supermassive star clusters have so far hampered the identification of their very low mass members, required to extend our understanding of star and planet formation, and early stellar evolution, to starburst. This situation has now evolved thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and its unmatched resolution and sensitivity in the infrared. In this paper, the third of the series of the Extended Westerlund 1 and 2 Open Clusters Survey (EWOCS), we present JWST/NIRCam and JWST/MIRI observations of the supermassive star cluster Westerlund 1. These observations are specifically designed to unveil the cluster members down to the BD mass regime, and to allow us to select and study the protoplanetary disks and to study the mutual feedback between the cluster members and the surrounding environment. Westerlund 1 was observed as part of JWST GO-1905 for 23.6 hours. The data have been reduced using the JWST calibration pipeline, together with specific tools necessary to remove artifacts. Source identification and photometry were performed with DOLPHOT. The MIRI images show a plethora of different features. Diffuse nebular emission is observed around the cluster, which is typically composed of myriads of droplet-like features pointing toward the cluster center or the group of massive stars surrounding the WR star W72/A. A long pillar is also observed in the NW. The MIRI images also show resolved shells and outflows surrounding the M-type RSG W20, W26, W75, and W237, the sgB[e] star W9 and the YHG W4. The color-magnitude diagrams built using the NIRCam photometry show a clear cluster sequence, which is marked in its upper part by the 1828 NIRCam stars with X-ray counterparts. NIRCam observations using the F115W filter have reached the 23.8 mag limit with 50\% completeness (roughly corresponding to a 0.06 Msol brown dwarf).         |
