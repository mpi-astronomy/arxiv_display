|**Abstract**| We present eclipse maps of the two-dimensional thermal emission from the dayside of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b, derived from an observation of a phase curve with the JWST MIRI/LRS instrument. The observed eclipse shapes deviate significantly from those expected for a planet emitting uniformly over its surface. We fit a map to this deviation, constructed from spherical harmonics up to order $\ell_{\rm max}=2$, alongside the planetary, orbital, stellar, and systematic parameters. This yields a map with a meridionally-averaged eastward hot-spot shift of $(7.75 \pm 0.36)^{\circ}$, with no significant degeneracy between the map and the additional parameters. We show the latitudinal and longitudinal contributions of the day-side emission structure to the eclipse shape, finding a latitudinal signal of $\sim$200 ppm and a longitudinal signal of $\sim$250 ppm. To investigate the sensitivity of the map to the method, we fix the non-mapping parameters and derive an "eigenmap" fitted with an optimised number of orthogonal phase curves, which yields a similar map to the $\ell_{\rm max}=2$ map. We also fit a map up to $\ell_{\rm max}=3$, which shows a smaller hot-spot shift, with a larger uncertainty. These maps are similar to those produced by atmospheric simulations. We conclude that there is a significant mapping signal which constrains the spherical harmonic components of our model up to $\ell_{\rm max}=2$. Alternative mapping models may derive different structures with smaller-scale features; we suggest that further observations of WASP-43b and other planets will drive the development of more robust methods and more accurate maps. |

|**Abstract**| As weak lensing surveys go deeper, there is an increasing need for reliable characterization of non-Gaussian structures at small angular scales. Here we present the first cosmological constraints with weak lensing scattering transform, a statistical estimator that combines efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. With the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey (HSC) year 1 data, we obtain $\Omega_\text{m}=0.29_{-0.03}^{+0.04}$, $S_8\equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_\text{m}/0.3)^{0.5}=0.83\pm0.02$, and intrinsic alignment strength $A_\text{IA}=1.0\pm0.4$ through simulation-based forward modeling. Our constraints are consistent with those derived from Planck. The error bar of $\Omega_\text{m}$ is 2 times tighter than that obtained from the power spectrum when the same scale range is used. This constraining power is on par with that of convolutional neural networks, suggesting that further investment in spatial information extraction may not yield substantial benefits. We also point out an internal tension of $S_8$ estimates linked to a redshift bin around z ~ 1 in the HSC data. We found that discarding that bin leads to a consistent decrease of $S_8$ from 0.83 to 0.79, for all statistical estimators. We argue that photometric redshift estimation is now the main limitation in the estimation of $S_8$ using HSC. This limitation is likely to affect other ground-based weak lensing surveys reaching redshifts greater than one. Alternative redshift estimation techniques, like clustering redshifts, may help alleviate this limitation. |

|**Abstract**| Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are known for their long-term stability. Using six years of observations from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), we have conducted an in-depth analysis of the X-ray timing results for six MSPs: PSRs B1937+21, B1821$-$24, J0437$-$4715, J0030+0451, J0218+4232, and J2124$-$3358. The timing stability parameter $\sigma_z$ has been calculated, revealing remarkable timing precision on the order of $10^{-14}$ for PSRs B1937+21 and J0437$-$4715, and $10^{-13}$ for PSRs B1821$-$24, J0218+4232, and J0030+0451 over a timescale of 1000 days. These findings underscore the feasibility of autonomous in-orbit timekeeping using X-ray observations of MSPs. In addition, the consistency of long-term spin-down noise in the X-ray and radio bands has been investigated by comparison with IPTA radio data. |

|**Abstract**| Radio bursts of magnetically active stars reveal the intensity and activity of the stellar magnetic field. They may also be related to the planets around the stars. We monitored a radio-active star, AD Leonis, 3000 seconds per day for 17 days in November 2020, and 5000 seconds per day for 5 days in July 2023 with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Based on the simultaneous flux increases in Stokes I and Stokes V, one left-hand circular polarized radio burst is identified. The $\sim50\%$ degree of circular polarization indicates the burst being originated from non-thermal radiation related to the stellar magnetic field. Combining the newly discovered burst with previous observations of radio and X-ray bursts from AD Leonis, we did a periodicity analysis for the 49 bursts in total. No periodicity with confidence level $>3\sigma$ is found, while a candidate period of 3.04 days at $\approx 2\sigma$ confidence level is presented and discussed. Results of recent FAST observations and the periodicity analysis suggest a more compact campaign of observation toward this source, from which a more optimistic result of period search could be achieved. |

|**Abstract**| A firm establishment of the presence or the lack of periodicity in repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is crucial for determining their origins. Here we compile 1145 radio bursts of FRB 20121102A with fluence larger than 0.15 Jy ms from observations using the Five-hundredmeter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, Arecibo Observatory, Green Bank Telescope, Effelsberg Telescope, MeerKAT Telescope, Lovell Telescope, Deep Space Network 70 m radio telescopes, Very Large Array, and the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope spanning the time interval of MJD 57175-58776. A quasi-period of $157.1_{-4.8}^{+5.2}$ day and a candidate quasi-period of $4.605_{-0.010}^{+0.003}$ day are found through the phase-folding probability binomial analysis. The former is consistent with previous findings and the latter is new. The 4.605 day periodicity is more obvious in high-energy bursts with fluence larger than $10^{38}$ erg. The presence of these (candidate) quasi-periods, together with the corresponding width of burst accumulation in the phase space, are consistent with the bursts' originating from a binary degenerate star system with a close-by planet around the primary neutron star. |
