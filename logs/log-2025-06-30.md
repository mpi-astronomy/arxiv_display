|**Abstract**|            We investigate the accuracy and range of validity of the perturbative model for the 2-point (2PCF) and 3-point (3PCF) correlation functions in real space in view of the forthcoming analysis of the Euclid mission spectroscopic sample. We take advantage of clustering measurements from four snapshots of the Flagship I N-body simulations at z = {0.9, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8}, which mimic the expected galaxy population in the ideal case of absence of observational effects such as purity and completeness. For the 3PCF we consider all available triangle configurations given a minimal separation. First, we assess the model performance by fixing the cosmological parameters and evaluating the goodness-of-fit provided by the perturbative bias expansion in the joint analysis of the two statistics, finding overall agreement with the data down to separations of 20 Mpc/h. Subsequently, we build on the state-of-the-art and extend the analysis to include the dependence on three cosmological parameters: the amplitude of scalar perturbations As, the matter density {\omega}cdm and the Hubble parameter h. To achieve this goal, we develop an emulator capable of generating fast and robust modelling predictions for the two summary statistics, allowing efficient sampling of the joint likelihood function. We therefore present the first joint full-shape analysis of the real-space 2PCF and 3PCF, testing the consistency and constraining power of the perturbative model across both probes, and assessing its performance in a combined likelihood framework. We explore possible systematic uncertainties induced by the perturbative model at small scales finding an optimal scale cut of rmin = 30 Mpc/h for the 3PCF, when imposing an additional limitation on nearly isosceles triangular configurations included in the data vector. This work is part of a Euclid Preparation series validating theoretical models for galaxy clustering.         |

|**Abstract**|            Large SEPs can cause adverse space weather hazard to humans technology and such events are especially associated with halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs). But in turn, a significant portion of halo-CMEs are not associated with large SEPs. The objective of this study is to gain an understanding of the source region distinctions between halo-CMEs in SEP and No-SEP events. Among the 176 halo-CMEs observed from 2010-2024, we screen out 45 large SEP events and 131 No-SEP events from this dataset. It is revealed that CME speed is a good discriminator between SEP and No-SEP events. Through classifying the source regions of all the halo-CMEs, we find that 53\% of SEP events originate from ``Single AR'', and 47\% from ``Multiple ARs'' or ``Outside of ARs''. The corresponding proportion for No-SEP events is 70\% and 30\%. This suggests that SEP source regions are more likely to originate from large-scale sources. We have also calculated the relevant magnetic parameters of the source regions and found that SEP source regions have higher magnetic free energy and reconnection flux compared to No-SEP source regions. However, SEP source regions are smaller in terms of the intensive magnetic parameters such as mean characteristic magnetic twist $\alpha$ and mean shear angles. Our statistical results can provide new potential variables for forecasting SEPs.         |
