|**Abstract**| Probing the molecular gas reservoirs of z>~6 quasar (QSO) host galaxies is fundamental to understanding the coevolution of star formation and black hole growth in these extreme systems. Yet, there is still an inhomogeneous coverage of molecular gas tracers. To measure the average excitation and mass of the molecular gas reservoirs in the brightest z>6.5 QSO hosts, we combined new observations of CO(2-1) emission with existing observations of CO(6-5), CO(7-6), [C I], [C II], and dust-continuum emission. We reduced and analysed the VLA observations of CO(2-1) in three z=6.5-6.9 QSO hosts--the highest redshift observations of CO(2-1) to date. By combining these with the nine z=5.7-6.4 QSO hosts for which CO(2-1) has already been observed, we studied the spread in molecular gas masses and CO excitation. Two of our three QSOs, were undetected in CO(2-1), implying more highly excited CO than in the z=6.4 QSO J1148+5251. We detected CO(2-1) at $5.1\sigma$ for our highest-redshift target, J2348-3054, yielding a molecular gas mass of $(1.2\pm0.2)\times 10^{10}\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$. This molecular gas mass is equivalent to the lower limit on the dynamical mass measured from resolved [C II] observations, implying little mass in stars or neutral gas within the [C II]-emitting region. On average, these QSO hosts have far higher CO(6-5)-, CO(7-6)-, and [C II] vs CO(2-1) line ratios than local AGN hosts; with a mean CO(6-5)-to-CO(1-0) line luminosity ratio of $r_{6,1}=0.9\pm0.2$. Our new CO(2-1) observations show that even at 780 Myr after the Big Bang, QSO host galaxies can already have molecular gas masses of $10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, consistent with a picture in which these z>6 QSOs reside in massive starbursts that are coevolving with the supermassive black holes. Our results imply the presence of extremely dense and warm molecular gas reservoirs illuminated by strong interstellar radiation fields. |

|**Abstract**| In this manuscript, clues are provided to support globally negative AGN feedback on star formation in the host galaxies of the local low-redshift SDSS Type-2 AGN, based on the different dependence of narrow H$\alpha$ line luminosity $L_{H\alpha}$ on optical continuum luminosity $\lambda L_{cont}$ between the starforming galaxies and the Type-2 AGN. Through the measured $L_{H\alpha}$ and $\lambda L_{cont}$ in SDSS starforming galaxies, there is a strong linear correlation between $\lambda L_{cont}$ and $L_{H\alpha}$, accepted as a standard correlation without effects of AGN activity. Meanwhile, considering apparent contributions of AGN activity to narrow H$\alpha$ line emissions in the Type-2 AGN, the correlation between $\lambda L_{cont}$ and $L_{H\alpha}$ in the SDSS Type-2 AGN leads to statistically lower $L_{H\alpha}$ in the Type-2 AGN than in the starforming galaxies, with significance level higher than 5$\sigma$, even after considering necessary effects (including effects of host galaxy properties), leading to accepted conclusion on the globally negative AGN feedback in the local Type-2 AGN. Meanwhile, properties of Dn(4000) and H$\delta_A$ can provide indirect clues to support the globally negative AGN feedback in the local Type-2 AGN, due to older stellar ages in the Type-2 AGN. Moreover, it is interesting to expect more than 50\% narrow H$\alpha$ emissions globally suppressed in the host galaxies of the Type-2 AGN relative to the starforming galaxies. The results not only support globally negative AGN feedback in the local Type-2 AGN, but also show further clues on the quantification of suppressions of star formation by the globally negative AGN feedback. |
