|**Abstract**| The goal of this work is to characterize the polarization effects of the VLTI and GRAVITY. This is needed to calibrate polarimetric observations with GRAVITY for instrumental effects and to understand the systematic error introduced to the astrometry due to birefringence when observing targets with a significant intrinsic polarization. By combining a model of the VLTI light path and its mirrors and dedicated experimental data, we construct a full polarization model of the VLTI UTs and the GRAVITY instrument. We first characterize all telescopes together to construct a UT calibration model for polarized targets. We then expand the model to include the differential birefringence. With this, we can constrain the systematic errors for highly polarized targets. Together with this paper, we publish a standalone Python package to calibrate the instrumental effects on polarimetric observations. This enables the community to use GRAVITY to observe targets in a polarimetric observing mode. We demonstrate the calibration model with the galactic center star IRS 16C. For this source, we can constrain the polarization degree to within 0.4 % and the polarization angle within 5 deg while being consistent with the literature. Furthermore, we show that there is no significant contrast loss, even if the science and fringe-tracker targets have significantly different polarization, and we determine that the phase error in such an observation is smaller than 1 deg, corresponding to an astrometric error of 10 {\mu}as. With this work, we enable the use of the polarimetric mode with GRAVITY/UTs and outline the steps necessary to observe and calibrate polarized targets. We demonstrate that it is possible to measure the intrinsic polarization of astrophysical sources with high precision and that polarization effects do not limit astrometric observations of polarized targets. |

|**Abstract**| Large sky spectroscopic surveys have reached the scale of photometric surveys in terms of sample sizes and data complexity. These huge datasets require efficient, accurate, and flexible automated tools for data analysis and science exploitation. We present the Galaxy Spectra Network/GaSNet-II, a supervised multi-network deep learning tool for spectra classification and redshift prediction. GaSNet-II can be trained to identify a customized number of classes and optimize the redshift predictions for classified objects in each of them. It also provides redshift errors, using a network-of-networks that reproduces a Monte Carlo test on each spectrum, by randomizing their weight initialization. As a demonstration of the capability of the deep learning pipeline, we use 260k Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra from Data Release 16, separated into 13 classes including 140k galactic, and 120k extragalactic objects. GaSNet-II achieves 92.4% average classification accuracy over the 13 classes (larger than 90% for the majority of them), and an average redshift error of approximately 0.23% for galaxies and 2.1% for quasars. We further train/test the same pipeline to classify spectra and predict redshifts for a sample of 200k 4MOST mock spectra and 21k publicly released DESI spectra. On 4MOST mock data, we reach 93.4% accuracy in 10-class classification and an average redshift error of 0.55% for galaxies and 0.3% for active galactic nuclei. On DESI data, we reach 96% accuracy in (star/galaxy/quasar only) classification and an average redshift error of 2.8% for galaxies and 4.8% for quasars, despite the small sample size available. GaSNet-II can process ~40k spectra in less than one minute, on a normal Desktop GPU. This makes the pipeline particularly suitable for real-time analyses of Stage-IV survey observations and an ideal tool for feedback loops aimed at night-by-night survey strategy optimization. |

|**Abstract**| The visibilities measured by radio astronomical interferometers include non-astronomical correlated signals that arise from the local environment of the array. These correlated signals are especially important in compact arrays such as those under development for 21\,cm intensity mapping. The amplitudes of the contaminated visibilities can exceed the expected 21\,cm signal and represent a significant systematic effect. We study the receiver noise radiated by antennas in compact arrays and develop a model for how it couples to other antennas. We apply the model to the Tianlai Dish Pathfinder Array (TDPA), a compact array of 16, 6-m dish antennas. The coupling model includes electromagnetic simulations, measurements with a network analyzer, and measurements of the noise of the receivers. We compare the model to drift-scan observations with the array and set requirements on the level of antenna cross-coupling for 21\,cm intensity mapping instruments. We find that for the TDPA, cross-coupling would have to be reduced by TBD orders of magnitude in order to contribute negligibly to the visibilities. |

|**Abstract**| Although low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations (LFQPOs) are commonly detected in the X-ray light curves of accreting black hole X-ray binaries, their origin still remains elusive. In this study, we conduct phase-resolved spectroscopy in a broad energy band for LFQPOs in MAXI J1820+070 during its 2018 outburst, utilizing Insight-HXMT observations. By employing the Hilbert-Huang transform method, we extract the intrinsic quasiperiodic oscillation (QPO) variability, and obtain the corresponding instantaneous amplitude, phase, and frequency functions for each data point. With well-defined phases, we construct QPO waveforms and phase-resolved spectra. By comparing the phase-folded waveform with that obtained from the Fourier method, we find that phase folding on the phase of the QPO fundamental frequency leads to a slight reduction in the contribution of the harmonic component. This suggests that the phase difference between QPO harmonics exhibits time variability. Phase-resolved spectral analysis reveals strong concurrent modulations of the spectral index and flux across the bright hard state. The modulation of the spectral index could potentially be explained by both the corona and jet precession models, with the latter requiring efficient acceleration within the jet. Furthermore, significant modulations in the reflection fraction are detected exclusively during the later stages of the bright hard state. These findings provide support for the geometric origin of LFQPOs and offer valuable insights into the evolution of the accretion geometry during the outburst in MAXI J1820+070. |

|**Abstract**| Using a fully Bayesian approach, Gaussian Process regression is extended to include marginalisation over the kernel choice and kernel hyperparameters. In addition, Bayesian model comparison via the evidence enables direct kernel comparison. The calculation of the joint posterior was implemented with a transdimensional sampler which simultaneously samples over the discrete kernel choice and their hyperparameters by embedding these in a higher-dimensional space, from which samples are taken using nested sampling. This method was explored on synthetic data from exoplanet transit light curve simulations. The true kernel was recovered in the low noise region while no kernel was preferred for larger noise. Furthermore, inference of the physical exoplanet hyperparameters was conducted. In the high noise region, either the bias in the posteriors was removed, the posteriors were broadened or the accuracy of the inference was increased. In addition, the uncertainty in mean function predictive distribution increased due to the uncertainty in the kernel choice. Subsequently, the method was extended to marginalisation over mean functions and noise models and applied to the inference of the present-day Hubble parameter, $H_0$, from real measurements of the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift, derived from the cosmologically model-independent cosmic chronometer and {\Lambda}CDM-dependent baryon acoustic oscillation observations. The inferred $H_0$ values from the cosmic chronometers, baryon acoustic oscillations and combined datasets are $H_0$ = 66$\pm$6 km/s/Mpc, $H_0$ = 67$\pm$10 km/s/Mpc and $H_0$ = 69$\pm$6 km/s/Mpc, respectively. The kernel posterior of the cosmic chronometers dataset prefers a non-stationary linear kernel. Finally, the datasets are shown to be not in tension with ln(R)=12.17$\pm$0.02. |
