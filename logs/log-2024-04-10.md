|**Abstract**| We review some recent results of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GR-MHD) simulations considering the evolution of geometrically thin disks around a central black hole. Thin disk GR-MHD simulations complement the widely used MAD (Magnetically Arrested Disk) or SANE (Standard And Normal Evolution) approaches of evolving from an initial disk torus. In particular, we discuss the dynamical evolution of the disk, its role in the formation of disk winds or jets, the impact of disk resistivity, and its potential role in generating magnetic flux by an internal disk dynamo. The main characteristics of a thin disk in our approach are the Keplerian rotation of the disk material, which allows to launch disk outflows by the Blandford-Payne magneto-centrifugal effect, in addition to the Blandford-Znajek-driven spine jet from the black hole ergosphere. Thus, for this approach, we neglect disk thermodynamics and radiative effects, concentrating predominantly on the dynamical evolution of the system. Resistive MHD further allows the investigation of physical reconnection and also dynamo action. Magnetic reconnection may generate magnetic islands of plasmoids that are ejected from the disk along with the outflow. We also discussed potential applications of thin disk in explaining the decaying phase of an outburst in black hole X-ray binaries (BH-XRBs). Post-processing of radiation using the simulated dynamical data allows to derive spectra or fluxes, e.g., in the X-ray band, and to derive potential variability characteristics. |

|**Abstract**| Context. Periodic QSOs are considered as candidates of supermassive binary black hole (BBH) systems in galactic centers. Further confirmation of these candidates may require different lines of observational evidences. Aims. Assuming the Doopler boosting scenario, in this paper we investigate the (coherent) variations of both broad emission lines (BELs) and continuum light curves for active BBH systems surrounding by a circumbinary broad line region (cBLR) and focus on their dependence on the eccentric orbital configuration. Methods. We calculate the variation of continuum light and the Doppler enhanced/weakened photoionization of each BLR cloud according to the motion of BBHs in elliptical orbits, and finally obtain the coherent variation of the continuum and BELs. Results. We find that both the amplitude and variation pattern of the continuum light curves and the evolution of the BEL profiles sensitively depend on the eccentric orbital configuration of BBH systems. If only the secondary BH is active, both the variation amplitudes of continuum light curves and BELs increase with increasing BBH inclination angles and orbital eccentricities, but decrease with increasing BBH mass ratio. If both BHs are active, the asymmetry in the ionization of BLR clouds at different areas caused by the Doppler boosting effect of the secondary BH is weakened due to that of the primary BH at the opposite direction, which leads to systematically smaller variation amplitudes of both continuum light curves and BELs than the cases with only secondary BH activated. Conclusions. The coherent variations of the BEL profiles with the continuum light for those periodic QSOs provide an important way to confirm the existence of BBHs in their center. Future joint analysis of the light curves and multi-epoch observed BEL profiles for periodic QSOs may lead to the identification of a number of BBH systems. |

|**Abstract**| We undertake a project to reexamine microlensing data gathered from high-cadence surveys. The aim of the project is to reinvestigate lensing events with light curves exhibiting intricate anomaly features associated with caustics, yet lacking prior proposed models to explain these features. Through detailed reanalyses considering higher-order effects, we identify that accounting for orbital motions of lenses is vital in accurately explaining the anomaly features observed in the light curves of the lensing events OGLE-2018-BLG-0971, MOA-2023-BLG-065, and OGLE-2023-BLG-0136. We estimate the masses and distances to the lenses by conducting Bayesian analyses using the lensing parameters of the newly found lensing solutions. From these analyses, we identify that the lenses of the events OGLE-2018-BLG-0971 and MOA-2023-BLG-065 are binaries composed of M dwarfs, while the lens of OGLE-2023-BLG-0136 is likely to be a binary composed of an early K-dwarf primary and a late M-dwarf companion. For all lensing events, the probability of the lens residing in the bulge is considerably higher than that of it being located in the disk. |

|| <mark>F. Nasir</mark>, et al. -- incl., <mark>P. Gaikwad</mark> |
|*Appeared on*| *2024-04-10*|
|*Comments*| *17 pages, Submitted to MNRAS*|
|**Abstract**| Unveiling the thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at $4 \leq z \leq 5$ holds the potential to reveal early onset HeII reionization or lingering thermal fluctuations from HI reionization. We set out to reconstruct the IGM gas properties along simulated Lyman-alpha forest data on pixel-by-pixel basis, employing deep Bayesian neural networks. Our approach leverages the Sherwood-Relics simulation suite, consisting of diverse thermal histories, to generate mock spectra. Our convolutional and residual networks with likelihood metric predicts the Ly$\alpha$ optical depth-weighted density or temperature for each pixel in the Ly$\alpha$ forest skewer. We find that our network can successfully reproduce IGM conditions with high fidelity across range of instrumental signal-to-noise. These predictions are subsequently translated into the temperature-density plane, facilitating the derivation of reliable constraints on thermal parameters. This allows us to estimate temperature at mean cosmic density, $T_{\rm 0}$ with one sigma confidence $\delta T_{\rm 0} \sim 1000{\rm K}$ using only one $20$Mpc/h sightline ($\Delta z\simeq 0.04$) with a typical reionization history. Existing studies utilize redshift pathlength comparable to $\Delta z\simeq 4$ for similar constraints. We can also provide more stringent constraints on the slope ($1\sigma$ confidence interval $\delta {\rm \gamma} \lesssim 0.1$) of the IGM temperature-density relation as compared to other traditional approaches. We test the reconstruction on a single high signal-to-noise observed spectrum ($20$ Mpc/h segment), and recover thermal parameters consistent with current measurements. This machine learning approach has the potential to provide accurate yet robust measurements of IGM thermal history at the redshifts in question. |
