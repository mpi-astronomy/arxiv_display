|**Abstract**|            Fragmentation and evolution for the molecular shells of the compact HII regions are less explored compared to their evolved counterparts. We map nine compact HII regions with a typical diameter of 0.4 pc that are surrounded by molecular shells traced by CCH. Several to a dozen dense gas fragments probed by H13CO+ are embedded in these molecular shells. These gas fragments, strongly affected by the HII region, have a higher surface density, mass, and turbulence than those outside the shells but within the same pc-scale natal clump. These features suggest that the shells swept up by the early HII regions can enhance the formation of massive dense structures that may host the birth of higher-mass stars. We examine the formation of fragments and find that fragmentation of the swept-up shell is unlikely to occur in these early HII regions, by comparing the expected time scale of shell fragmentation with the age of HII region. We propose that the appearance of gas fragments in these shells is probably the result of sweeping up pre-existing fragments into the molecular shell that has not yet fragmented. Taken together, this work provides a basis for understanding the interplay of star-forming sites with an intricate environment containing ionization feedback such as those observed in starburst regions.         |

|**Abstract**|            In this communication, we report on the results of the second phase of the Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge started in 2019. This second phase focuses on the characterization of point sources (exoplanet signals) within multispectral high-contrast images from ground-based telescopes. We collected eight data sets from two high-contrast integral field spectrographs (namely Gemini-S/GPI and VLT/SPHERE-IFS) that we calibrated homogeneously, and in which we injected a handful of synthetic planetary signals (ground truth) to be characterized by the data challenge participants. The tasks of the participants consist of (1) extracting the precise astrometry of each injected planetary signals, and (2) extracting the precise spectro-photometry of each injected planetary signal. Additionally, the participants may provide the 1-sigma uncertainties on their estimation for further analyses. When available, the participants can also provide the posterior distribution used to estimate the position/spectrum and uncertainties. The data are permanently available on a Zenodo repository and the participants can submit their results through the EvalAI platform. The EvalAI submission platform opened on April 2022 and closed on the 31st of May 2024. In total, we received 4 valid submissions for the astrometry estimation and 4 valid submissions for the spectrophotometry (each submission, corresponding to one pipeline, has been submitted by a unique participant). In this communication, we present an analysis and interpretation of the results.         |

|**Abstract**|            Radially extended disk winds could be the key to unlocking how protoplanetary disks accrete and how planets form and migrate. A distinctive characteristic is their nested morphology of velocity and chemistry. Here we report JWST/NIRSpec spectro-imaging of four young stars with edge-on disks in the Taurus star-forming region that demonstrate the ubiquity of this structure. In each source, a fast collimated jet traced by [Fe II] is nested inside a hollow cavity within wider lower-velocity H2 and, in one case, also CO ro-vibrational (v=1-0) emission. Furthermore, in one of our sources, ALMA CO(2-1) emission, paired with our NIRSpec images, reveals the nested wind structure extends further outward. This nested wind morphology strongly supports theoretical predictions for wind-driven accretion and underscores the need for theoretical work to assess the role of winds in the formation and evolution of planetary systems         |

|**Abstract**|            Cosmic voids, distinguished by their low-density environment, provide a unique opportunity to explore the interplay between the cosmic environment and the processes of galaxy formation and evolution. Data on the molecular gas has been scarce so far. In this paper, we continue previous research done in the CO-CAVITY pilot project to study the molecular gas content and properties in void galaxies to search for possible differences compared to galaxies that inhabit denser structures. We observed at the IRAM 30 m telescope the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) emission of 106 void galaxies selected from the CAVITY survey. Together with data from the literature, we obtained a sample of 200 void galaxies with CO data. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of the specific star formation rate (sSFR = SFR/M$_*$), the molecular gas fraction (MH$_2$/M$_*$), and the star formation efficiency (SFE = SFR/MH$_2$) between the void galaxies and a comparison sample of galaxies in filaments and walls, selected from the xCOLD GASS survey. We found no statistically significant difference between void galaxies and the comparison sample in the molecular gas fraction as a function of stellar mass for galaxies on the star-forming main sequence (SFMS). However, for void galaxies, the SFE was found to be constant across all stellar mass bins, while there is a decreasing trend with M$_*$ for the comparison sample. Finally, we found some indications for a smaller dynamical range in the molecular gas fraction as a function of distance to the SFMS in void galaxies. Overall, our analysis finds that the molecular gas properties of void galaxies are not very different from denser environments. The physical origin of the most significant difference that we found - a constant SFE as a function of stellar mass in void galaxies - is unclear and requires further investigation and higher-resolution data.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2024-10-24*|

|**Abstract**|            We present HIP 8522, a young solar twin with the lowest detected lithium, potentially a field blue straggler or the result of episodic early accretion. Its stellar parameters ($T_{\rm eff} = 5729 \pm 7$ K, $\log g = 4.532 \pm 0.016$ dex, $\rm{[Fe/H]} = 0.005 \pm 0.010$ dex, $v_{t} = 1.08 \pm 0.02$ km s$^{-1}$) and chemical composition were determined via spectroscopic equilibrium using high resolution spectra ($R = 60~000-165~000$). The age of HIP 8522 was estimated to be an upper limit of $<$1 Gyr through isochrone fitting and was further confirmed using chemical clocks. Spectral synthesis of the lithium line at $\sim$6707.8 Å yielded an upper lithium abundance limit of $A(\rm{Li}) <$ 0.8 dex. This value is unusually low for solar twins of similar age, which typically have $A(\rm{Li})$ values ranging from 2.0 to 3.3 dex, suggesting that $\sim$2 dex of lithium is missing. We investigate various scenarios, such as planet engulfment, sub-stellar mergers, and extra mixing. However, two distinct hypotheses provide plausible explanations for the significant depletion of lithium: one suggests that HIP 8522 is a field blue straggler formed by the merger of a close binary, while the other proposes that HIP 8522 experienced early episodic accretion. The young solar twin HIP 8522 presents an exceptional opportunity to rigorously test stellar evolution models and gain crucial insights into the internal mixing mechanisms responsible for the significant destruction of lithium.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Chasing All Transients Constellation Hunters (CATCH) space mission is focused on exploring the dynamic universe via X-ray follow-up observations of various transients. The first pathfinder of the CATCH mission, CATCH-1, was launched on June 22, 2024, alongside the Space-based multiband astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) mission. CATCH-1 is equipped with narrow-field optimized Micro Pore Optics (MPOs) featuring a large effective area and incorporates four Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs) in its focal plane. This paper presents the system calibration results conducted before the satellite integration. Utilizing the data on the performance of the mirror and detectors obtained through the system calibration, combined with simulated data, the ground calibration database can be established. Measuring the relative positions of the mirror and detector system, which were adjusted during system calibration, allows for accurate installation of the entire satellite. Furthermore, the paper outlines the operational workflow of the ground network post-satellite launch.         |

|**Abstract**|            LEIA (Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy) detected a new X-ray transient on November 7, 2022, identified as a superflare event occurring on a nearby RS CVn-type binary HD 251108. The flux increase was also detected in follow-up observations at X-ray, UV and optical wavelengths. The flare lasted for about 40 days in soft X-ray observations, reaching a peak luminosity of ~1.1 * 10^34 erg/s in 0.5-4.0 keV, which is roughly 60 times the quiescent luminosity. Optical brightening was observed for only one night. The X-ray light curve is well described by a double "FRED" (fast rise and exponential decay) model, attributed to the cooling process of a loop arcade structure formed subsequent to the initial large loop with a half-length of ~1.9 times the radius of the host star. Time-resolved X-ray spectra were fitted with a two-temperature apec model, showing significant evolution of plasma temperature, emission measure, and metal abundance over time. The estimated energy released in the LEIA band is ~3 * 10^39 erg, suggesting this is likely the most energetic X-ray stellar flare with the longest duration detected to date.         |

|**Abstract**|            The physics of recombination lines (RLs) in the HeI singlet system is expected to be relatively simple, supported by accurate atomic models. We examine the intensities of HeI singlets $\lambda \lambda$3614, 3965, 5016, 6678, 7281 and the triplet HeI $\lambda$5876 in various types of ionized nebulae and compare them with theoretical predictions to test the validity of the ``Case B'' recombination scenario and the assumption of thermal homogeneity. Our analysis includes 85 spectra from Galactic and extragalactic HII regions, 90 from star-forming galaxies, and 218 planetary nebulae, all compiled by the DEep Spectra of Ionized REgions Database Extended (DESIRED-E) project. By evaluating the ratios HeI $\lambda$7281/$\lambda$6678 and HeI $\lambda$7281/$\lambda$5876, we determine $T_e$(HeI) and compare it with direct measurements of $T_e$([OIII] $\lambda$4363/$\lambda$5007). We find that $T_e$(HeI) is systematically lower than $T_e$([OIII]) across most objects and nebula types. Additionally, we identify a correlation between the abundance discrepancy factor (ADF(O$^{2+}$)) and the difference $T_e$([OIII]) - $T_e$(HeI) for planetary nebulae. We explore two potential explanations: photon loss from $n^1P \rightarrow 1^1S$ transitions and temperature inhomogeneities. Deviations from ``Case B'' may indicate photon absorption by HI rather than HeI and/or generalized ionizing photon escape, highlighting the need for detailed consideration of radiative transfer effects. If temperature inhomogeneities are widespread, identifying a common physical phenomenon affecting all ionized nebulae is crucial. Our results suggest that both scenarios can contribute to the observed discrepancies.         |
