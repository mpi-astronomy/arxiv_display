|**Abstract**|            Interferometric observations of gravitational microlensing events offer an opportunity for precise, efficient, and direct mass and distance measurements of lensing objects, especially those of isolated neutron stars and black holes. However, such observations were previously possible for only a handful of extremely bright events. The recent development of a dual-field interferometer, GRAVITY Wide, has made it possible to reach out to significantly fainter objects, and increase the pool of microlensing events amenable to interferometric observations by two orders of magnitude. Here, we present the first successful observation of a microlensing event with GRAVITY Wide and the resolution of microlensed images in the event OGLE-2023-BLG-0061/KMT-2023-BLG-0496. We measure the angular Einstein radius of the lens with a sub-percent precision, $\theta_{\rm E} = 1.280 \pm 0.009$ mas. Combined with the microlensing parallax detected from the event light curve, the mass and distance to the lens are found to be $0.472 \pm 0.012 M_{\odot}$ and $1.81 \pm 0.05$ kpc, respectively. We present the procedure for the selection of targets for interferometric observations, and discuss possible systematic effects affecting GRAVITY Wide data. This detection demonstrates the capabilities of the new instrument and it opens up completely new possibilities for the follow-up of microlensing events, and future routine discoveries of isolated neutron stars and black holes.         |

|**Abstract**|            Studying the orbital motion of stars around Sagittarius A* in the Galactic Center provides a unique opportunity to probe the gravitational potential near the supermassive black hole at the heart of our Galaxy. Interferometric data obtained with the GRAVITY instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) since 2016 has allowed us to achieve unprecedented precision in tracking the orbits of these stars. GRAVITY data have been key to detecting the in-plane, prograde Schwarzschild precession of the orbit of the star S2, as predicted by General Relativity. By combining astrometric and spectroscopic data from multiple stars, including S2, S29, S38, and S55 - for which we have data around their time of pericenter passage with GRAVITY - we can now strengthen the significance of this detection to an approximately $10 \sigma$ confidence level. The prograde precession of S2's orbit provides valuable insights into the potential presence of an extended mass distribution surrounding Sagittarius A*, which could consist of a dynamically relaxed stellar cusp comprised of old stars and stellar remnants, along with a possible dark matter spike. Our analysis, based on two plausible density profiles - a power-law and a Plummer profile - constrains the enclosed mass within the orbit of S2 to be consistent with zero, establishing an upper limit of approximately $1200 \, M_\odot$ with a $1 \sigma$ confidence level. This significantly improves our constraints on the mass distribution in the Galactic Center. Our upper limit is very close to the expected value from numerical simulations for a stellar cusp in the Galactic Center, leaving little room for a significant enhancement of dark matter density near Sagittarius A*.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Kepler space mission provided high-quality light curves for more than 16 000 red giants. The global stellar oscillations extracted from these light curves carry information about the interior of the stars. Several hundred red giants were found to have low amplitudes in their dipole modes (i.e. they are suppressed dipole-mode stars). A number of hypotheses (involving e.g. a magnetic field, binarity, or resonant mode coupling) have been proposed to explain the suppression of the modes, yet none has been confirmed. We aim to gain insight into the mechanism at play in suppressed dipole-mode stars by investigating the mode properties (linewidths, heights, and amplitudes) of the radial oscillation modes of red giants with suppressed dipole modes. We selected from the literature suppressed dipole-mode stars and compared the radial-mode properties of these stars to the radial-mode properties of stars in two control samples of stars with typical (i.e. non-suppressed) dipole modes. We find that the radial-mode properties of the suppressed dipole-mode stars are consistent with the ones in our control samples, and hence not affected by the suppression mechanism. From this we conclude that (1) the balance between the excitation and damping in radial modes is unaffected by the suppression, and by extrapolation the excitation of the non-radial modes is not affected either; and (2) the damping of the radial modes induced by the suppression mechanism is significantly less than the damping from turbulent convective motion, suggesting that the additional damping originates from the more central non-convective regions of the star, to which the radial modes are least sensitive.         |

|**Abstract**|            JWST has revealed diverse new populations of high-redshift ($z\sim4-11$) AGN and extreme star-forming galaxies that challenge current models. In this paper, we use rest-frame UV emission-line diagnostics to identify AGN candidates and other exceptional ionizing sources, complementing previous studies predominantly focused on broad-line AGN. In this paper, we use rest-frame UV emission-line diagnostics to identify AGN candidates and other exceptional ionizing sources, complementing previous studies predominantly focused on broad-line AGN. From a parent sample of 205 $\mathrm{z_{spec}}>3$ UNCOVER galaxies with NIRSpec/PRISM follow-up, we identify 12 C IV, He II, and C III] emitters. Leveraging the combined rest-optical and UV coverage of PRISM, we limit the emission-line model space using the sample's [O III]/H$\beta$ distribution, significantly decreasing the overlap between AGN and star-formation models in the UV diagnostics. We then find that the five He II emitters are the strongest AGN candidates, with further support from two [Ne V] detections and one X-ray detection from Chandra. We cannot robustly quantify the AGN fraction in this sample, but we note that close to 20% of $\mathrm{M_{*}>2\times10^{9}\,M_{\odot}}$ parent sample galaxies are AGN candidates. The lower-mass line emitters, which are consistent with both AGN and star-forming photoionization models, have more compact sizes and higher specific star formation rates than the parent sample. Higher-resolution and deeper data on these UV line emitters should provide much stronger constraints on the obscured AGN fraction at $z > 3$.         |
