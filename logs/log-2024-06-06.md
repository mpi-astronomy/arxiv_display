|**Abstract**|            Debris disks give us the unique opportunity to probe the properties of small $\mu$m-sized particles, allowing us to peer into the constituents of their parent bodies, young analogs of comets and asteroids of our solar system. In the past, studies of the total intensity phase function have proven powerful to constrain the main characteristics of the dust particles in debris disks. Nonetheless, there can remain some degeneracies in the modeling that can be alleviated when considering polarized intensity observations. We obtained new near-IR scattered light observations of four young debris disks which allow us to constrain the degree of linear polarization as a function of the scattering angle. All four debris disks are detected in polarized intensity, and three are also recovered in total intensity. We measured peak degree of polarization of $\lesssim 40$\% for all three disks. We find that the particles must consist of highly refractive and absorbing material. For HD129590, by measuring the polarization fraction beyond the birth ring, we constrain the width of the size distribution to be smaller and smaller, compatible with the effect of radiation pressure. We put these findings to the test and present a self-consistent approach to produce synthetic images, assuming different profiles for the radiation pressure strength, and accounting for the presence of unbound grains. We find the contribution of these grains to be especially critical to reproduce the increasing degree of polarization with stellocentric distances. Some of our results might seem difficult to reconcile with our understanding of cosmic dust but since similar results have been obtained for other disks, we discuss the current limitation of available light scattering models as well as possible avenues to alleviate these unfortunate limitations.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present a study of $1347$ galaxies at $z<0.35$ with detected nuclear X-ray emission and optical emission line diagnostics in the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram. This sample was obtained by cross-matching the X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission Observatory - Newton (XMM-Newton) DR10 catalogue with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR17 galaxies with well-measured line ratios. The distribution of these sources in the BPT diagram covers all three excitation regimes: Ionized Hydrogen (HII) regions (23\%), `composites' (30\%), and Seyfert galaxies with the low ionization nuclear emission line regions (LINERs) (47\%). In contrast, the fraction of objects classified as active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the SDSS subsample selected for cross-match with XMM-Newton is only 13\%. This fact illustrates that X-ray emission from galaxies commonly points towards the presence of AGN. Our data show, for the first time, a clear dependence of the BPT position on the ratio of the X-ray to $H\alpha$ fluxes. Sources dominated by X-ray emission lie in the Seyfert and LINER regimes of the BPT diagram. Most sources with a low X-ray-to-$H\alpha$-luminosity ratio, $log_{10}(L_X/L_{H\alpha}) < 1.0$, lie in the HII regime. In our sample, there are even 45 galaxies that have $L^{Star}_{XR}/L^{Total}_{Xray}>0.5$. In contrast, the positions of the sample members in the BPT diagram exhibit {no} dependence on the X-ray hardness ratio. Our finding suggests that the X-ray-to-$H\alpha$ ratio can help us to differentiate galaxies whose X-ray flux is dominated by an AGN {from galaxies with} central X-ray binaries and other stellar X-ray sources.         |

|**Abstract**|            Spectroscopic phase curves of hot Jupiters measure their emission spectra at multiple orbital phases, thus enabling detailed characterisation of their atmospheres. Precise constraints on the atmospheric composition of these exoplanets offer insights into their formation and evolution. We analyse four phase-resolved emission spectra of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b, generated from a phase curve observed with the MIRI/LRS onboard the JWST, to retrieve its atmospheric properties. Using a parametric 2D temperature model and assuming a chemically homogeneous atmosphere within the observed pressure region, we simultaneously fit the four spectra to constrain the abundances of atmospheric constituents, thereby yielding more precise constraints than previous work that analysed each spectrum independently. Our analysis reveals statistically significant evidence of NH3 (4$\sigma$) in a hot Jupiter's emission spectra for the first time, along with evidence of H2O (6.5$\sigma$), CO (3.1$\sigma$), and a non-detection of CH4. With our abundance constraints, we tentatively estimate the metallicity of WASP-43b at 0.6-6.5$\times$solar and its C/O ratio at 0.6-0.9. Our findings offer vital insights into the atmospheric conditions and formation history of WASP-43b by simultaneously constraining the abundances of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen-bearing species.         |

|**Abstract**|            Star clusters are among the first celestial objects catalogued by early astronomers. As simple and coeval populations, their study has been instrumental in charting the properties of the Milky Way and providing insight into stellar evolution through the 20th century. Clusters were traditionally spotted as local stellar overdensities in the plane of the sky. In recent decades, for a limited number of nearby clusters, it became possible to identify cluster members through their clustering in proper motion space. With its astrometric data of unprecedented precision, the Gaia mission has completely revolutionised our ability to discover and characterise Milky Way star clusters, to map their large-scale distribution, and to investigate their internal structure. In this review we focus on the population of open clusters, residing in the Galactic disc. We summarise the current state of the Gaia-updated cluster census and studies of young clusters and associations. We discuss recent developments in techniques for cluster detection and age estimation. We also review results enabled by Gaia data concerning the dynamical evolution of gravitationally bound clusters and their stellar inventory.         |

|**Abstract**|            Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are major drivers of geomagnetic storms, which may cause severe space weather effects. Automating the detection, tracking, and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of CMEs is important for operational predictions of CME arrivals. The COR1 coronagraphs on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft have facilitated extensive polarization observations, which are very suitable for the establishment of a 3D CME system. We have developed such a 3D system comprising four modules: classification, segmentation, tracking, and 3D reconstructions. We generalize our previously pretrained classification model to classify COR1 coronagraph images. Subsequently, as there are no publicly available CME segmentation data sets, we manually annotate the structural regions of CMEs using Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph C2 observations. Leveraging transformer-based models, we achieve state-of-the-art results in CME segmentation. Furthermore, we improve the tracking algorithm to solve the difficult separation task of multiple CMEs. In the final module, tracking results, combined with the polarization ratio technique are used to develop the first single-view 3D CME catalog without requiring manual mask annotation. Our method provides higher precision in automatic 2D CME catalog and more reliable physical parameters of CMEs, including 3D propagation direction and speed. The aforementioned 3D CME system can be applied to any coronagraph data with the capability of polarization measurements.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report the detection of high-energy gamma-ray emission towards the G305 star-forming region. Using almost 15 years of observation data from {\sl Fermi} Large Area Telescope, we detected an extended gamma-ray source in this region with a significance of $\sim 13 \sigma$. The gamma-ray radiation reveals a clear pion-bump feature and can be fitted with the power law parent proton spectrum with an index of $-2.5$. The total cosmic ray (CR) proton energy in the gamma-ray production region is estimated to be the order of $10^{49}\ \rm erg$. We further derived the CR radial distribution from both the gamma-ray emission and gas distribution and found it roughly obeys the $1/r$ type profile, which is consistent with other similar systems and expected from the continuous injection of CRs by the central powerful young massive star cluster Danks 1 or Danks 2 in this region. Together with former detections of similar gamma-ray structures, such as Cygnus cocoon, Westerlund 1, Westerlund 2, NGC 3603, and W40, the detection supports the hypothesis that young massive star clusters are CR accelerators.         |

|| <mark>J. Li</mark>, et al. |

|**Abstract**|            Investigating the extinction law in regions of high dust extinction, such as the Pillars of Creation within the M16 region, is crucial for understanding the densest parts of the interstellar medium (ISM). In this study, we utilize observations from the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to analyze the color-excess ratios $E(F090W-\lambda)/E(F090W-F200W)$ across a wavelength range of $0.9-7.7\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. Our method involves performing linear regression on color-color diagrams to derive these ratios. The enhanced detection capabilities of JWST data allow us to probe the distinct extinction law to the densest regions in M16 corresponding to an extinction depth up to $A_V \sim 60$\,mag. Remarkably, the resultant color-excess ratio curve exhibits a flatter profile than predicted by typical dust extinction models with $R_V = 5.5$ for dense ISM environments. Moreover, we observe that the mid-infrared (MIR) extinction law diverges from the near-infrared (NIR) power-law, showing a tendency for the slope to flatten as the wavelength increases. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the dust properties in dense interstellar environments.         |
