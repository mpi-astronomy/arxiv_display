|**Abstract**|            Ice-coated dust grains provide the main reservoir of volatiles that play an important role in planet formation processes and may become incorporated into planetary atmospheres. However, due to observational challenges, the ice abundance distribution in protoplanetary disks is not well constrained. We present JWST/MIRI observations of the edge-on disk HH 48 NE carried out as part of the IRS program Ice Age. We detect CO$_2$, NH$_3$, H$_2$O and tentatively CH$_4$ and NH$_4^+$. Radiative transfer models suggest that ice absorption features are produced predominantly in the 50-100 au region of the disk. The CO$_2$ feature at 15 micron probes a region closer to the midplane (z/r = 0.1-0.15) than the corresponding feature at 4.3 micron (z/r = 0.2-0.6), but all observations trace regions significantly above the midplane reservoirs where we expect the bulk of the ice mass to be located. Ices must reach a high scale height (z/r ~ 0.6; corresponding to modeled dust extinction Av ~ 0.1), in order to be consistent with the observed vertical distribution of the peak ice optical depths. The weakness of the CO$_2$ feature at 15 micron relative to the 4.3 micron feature and the red emission wing of the 4.3 micron CO$_2$ feature are both consistent with ices being located at high elevation in the disk. The retrieved NH$_3$ abundance and the upper limit on the CH$_3$OH abundance relative to H$_2$O are significantly lower than those in the interstellar medium (ISM), but consistent with cometary observations. Full wavelength coverage is required to properly study the abundance distribution of ices in disks. To explain the presence of ices at high disk altitudes, we propose two possible scenarios: a disk wind that entrains sufficient amounts of dust, thus blocking part of the stellar UV radiation, or vertical mixing that cycles enough ices into the upper disk layers to balance ice photodesorption.         |

|**Abstract**|            Previous studies of the chemo-kinematic properties of stars in the Galactic bulge have revealed a puzzling trend. Along the bulge minor axis, and close to the Galactic plane, metal-rich stars display a higher line-of-sight velocity dispersion compared to metal-poor stars, while at higher latitudes metal-rich stars have lower velocity dispersions than metal-poor stars, similar to what is found in the Galactic disc. In this work, we re-examine this issue, by studying the dependence of line-of-sight velocity dispersions on metallicity and latitude in the latest APOGEE Data Release 17, confirming the results of previous works. We then analyse an N-body simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy, also taking into account observational biases introduced by the APOGEE selection function. We show that the inversion in the line-of-sight velocity dispersion-latitude relation observed in the Galactic bulge can be reproduced by our model. We show that this inversion is a natural consequence of a scenario in which the bulge is a boxy/peanut-shaped structure, whose metal-rich and metal-poor stars mainly originate from the thin and thick disc of the Milky Way, respectively. Due to their cold kinematics, metal-rich, thin disc stars, are efficiently trapped in the boxy/peanut bulge, and, at low latitudes, show a strong barred morphology, which results in high velocity dispersions which are larger than those attained by the metal-poor populations. Extremely metal-rich stars in the Galactic bulge, which have received renewed attention in the literature, do follow the same trends as those of the metal-rich populations. The line-of-sight velocity-latitude relation observed in the Galactic bulge for metal-poor and metal-rich stars are thus both an effect of the intrinsic nature of the Galactic bulge and of the angle at which we observe it from the Sun.         |

|**Abstract**|            Transmission spectroscopy has been a workhorse technique over the past two decades to constrain the physical and chemical properties of exoplanet atmospheres. One of its classical key assumptions is that the portion of the atmosphere it probes -- the terminator region -- is homogeneous. Several works in the past decade, however, have put this into question for highly irradiated, hot ($T_{eq}\gtrsim 1000$ K) gas giant exoplanets both empirically and via 3-dimensional modelling. While models predict clear differences between the evening (day-to-night) and morning (night-to-day) terminators, direct morning/evening transmission spectra in a wide wavelength range has not been reported for an exoplanet to date. Under the assumption of precise and accurate orbital parameters on WASP-39 b, here we report the detection of inhomogeneous terminators on the exoplanet WASP-39 b, which allows us to retrieve its morning and evening transmission spectra in the near-infrared ($2-5\ \mu$m) using JWST. We observe larger transit depths in the evening which are, on average, $405 \pm 88$ ppm larger than the morning ones, also having qualitatively larger features than the morning spectrum. The spectra are best explained by models in which the evening terminator is hotter than the morning terminator by $177^{+65}_{-57}$ K with both terminators having C/O ratios consistent with solar. General circulation models (GCMs) predict temperature differences broadly consistent with the above value and point towards a cloudy morning terminator and a clearer evening terminator.         |

|**Abstract**|            The Mid-infrared ELT Imager and Spectrograph (METIS) is one of the first-generation scientific instruments for the ELT, built under the supervision of ESO by a consortium of research institutes across and beyond Europe. Designed to cover the 3 to 13 $\mu$m wavelength range, METIS had its final design reviewed in Fall 2022, and has then entered in earnest its manufacture, assembly, integration, and test (MAIT) phase. Here, we present the final design of the METIS high-contrast imaging (HCI) modes. We detail the implementation of the two main coronagraphic solutions selected for METIS, namely the vortex coronagraph and the apodizing phase plate, including their combination with the high-resolution integral field spectrograph of METIS, and briefly describe their respective backup plans (Lyot coronagraph and shaped pupil plate). We then describe the status of the MAIT phase for HCI modes, including a review of the final design of individual components such as the vortex phase masks, the grayscale ring apodizer, and the apodizing phase plates, as well as a description of their on-going performance tests and of our plans for system-level integration and tests. Using end-to-end simulations, we predict the performance that will be reached on sky by the METIS HCI modes in presence of various environmental and instrumental disturbances, including non-common path aberrations and water vapor seeing, and discuss our strategy to mitigate these various effects. We finally illustrate with mock observations and data processing that METIS should be capable of directly imaging temperate rocky planets around the nearest stars.         |

|**Abstract**|            We present an implementation of Pop III.1 seeding of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in a theoretical model of galaxy formation and evolution to assess the growth the SMBH population and the properties of the host galaxies. The model of Pop III.1 seeding involves SMBH formation at redshifts $z\gtrsim 20$ in dark matter minihalos that are isolated from external radiative feedback, parameterized by isolation distance $d_{\rm iso}$. Within a standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we generate dark matter halos using the code \textsc{pinocchio} and seed them according to the Pop III.1 scenario, exploring values of $d_{\rm iso}$ from 50 to 100~kpc (proper distance). We consider two alternative cases of SMBH seeding: a Halo Mass Threshold (HMT) model in which all halos $>7\times10^{10}\:M_\odot$ are seeded with $\sim 10^5\:M_\odot$ black holes; an All Light Seed (ALS) model in which all halos are seeded with low, stellar-mass black holes. We follow the redshift evolution of the halos, populating them with galaxies using the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly theoretical model of galaxy formation, including accretion on SMBHs and related feedback processes. Here we present predictions for the properties of galaxy populations, focusing on stellar masses, star formation rates, and black hole masses. The local, $z\sim0$ metrics of occupation fraction as a function of the galaxy stellar mass, galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF), and black hole mass function (BHMF) all suggest a constraint of $d_{\rm iso}<75\:$kpc. We discuss the implications of this result for the Pop III.1 seeding mechanism.         |

|**Abstract**|            We report the first detection of polarization angle (PA) orthogonal jumps, a phenomenon previously only observed from radio pulsars, from a fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB 20201124A. We find three cases of orthogonal jumps in over two thousand bursts, all resembling those observed in pulsar single pulses. We propose that the jumps are due to the superposition of two orthogonal emission modes that could only be produced in a highly magnetized plasma, and they are caused by the line of sight sweeping across a rotating magnetosphere. The shortest jump timescale is of the order of one-millisecond, which hints that the emission modes come from regions smaller than the light cylinder of most pulsars or magnetars. This discovery provides convincing evidence that FRB emission originates from the complex magnetosphere of a magnetar, suggesting an FRB emission mechanism that is analogous to radio pulsars despite a huge luminosity difference between two types of objects.         |

|**Abstract**|            One of the main obstacles preventing the detection of the redshifted 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen in the early Universe is the astrophysical foreground emission, which is several orders of magnitude brighter than the signal. The foregrounds, due to their smooth spectra, are expected to predominantly occupy a region in the cylindrical power spectrum known as the foreground wedge. However, the conventional equations describing the extent of the foreground wedge are derived under a flat-sky approximation. This assumption breaks down for tracking wide-field instruments, thus rendering these equations inapplicable in these situations. In this paper, we derive equations for the full sky foreground wedge and show that the foregrounds can potentially extend far beyond what the conventional equations suggest. We also derive the equations that describe a specific bright source in the cylindrical power spectrum space. The validity of both sets of equations is tested against numerical simulations. Many current and upcoming interferometers (e.g., LOFAR, NenuFAR, MWA, SKA) are wide-field phase-tracking instruments. These equations give us new insights into the nature of foreground contamination in the cylindrical power spectra estimated using wide-field instruments. Additionally, they allow us to accurately associate features in the power spectrum to foregrounds or instrumental effects. The equations are also important for correctly selecting the "EoR window" for foreground avoidance analyses, and for planning 21-cm observations. In future analyses, it is recommended to use these updated horizon lines to indicate the foreground wedge in the cylindrical power spectrum accurately. The new equations for generating the updated wedge lines are made available in a Python library, pslines.         |

|*Appeared on*| *2024-07-16*|

|**Abstract**|            Cosmic shear is a powerful probe of cosmological models and the transition from current Stage-III surveys like the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) to the increased area and redshift range of Stage IV-surveys such as \Euclid will significantly increase the precision of weak lensing analyses. However, with increasing precision, the accuracy of model assumptions needs to be evaluated. In this study, we quantify the impact of the correlated clustering of weak lensing source galaxies with the surrounding large-scale structure, the so-called source-lens clustering (SLC), which is commonly neglected. We include the impact of realistic scatter in photometric redshift estimates, which impacts the assignment of galaxies to tomographic bins and increases the SLC. For this, we use simulated cosmological datasets with realistically distributed galaxies and measure shear correlation functions for both clustered and uniformly distributed source galaxies. Cosmological analyses are performed for both scenarios to quantify the impact of SLC on parameter inference for a KiDS-like and a \Euclid-like setting. We find for Stage III surveys like KiDS, SLC has a minor impact when accounting for nuisance parameters for intrinsic alignments and shifts of tomographic bins, as these nuisance parameters absorb the effect of SLC, thus changing their original meaning. For KiDS (\Euclid), the inferred intrinsic alignment amplitude $A_\mathrm{IA}$ changes from $0.11_{-0.46}^{+0.44}$ ($-0.009_{-0.080}^{+0.079}$) for data without SLC to $0.28_{-0.44}^{+0.42}$ ($0.022_{-0.082}^{+0.081}$) with SLC. However, fixed nuisance parameters lead to shifts in $S_8$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$. For \Euclid we find that $S_8$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ are shifted by 0.14 and 0.12 $\sigma$, respectively, when including free nuisance parameters. Consequently, SLC on its own has only a small impact on the inferred parameters.         |
