|**Abstract**|            We report the multiwavelength properties of eFEDS J084222.9+001000 (hereafter ID830), a quasar at $z=3.4351$, identified as the most X-ray luminous radio-loud quasar in the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS) field. ID830 shows a rest-frame 0.5-2 keV luminosity of $\log (L_\mathrm{0.5-2\,keV}/\mathrm{erg}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 46.20 \pm 0.12$, with a steep X-ray photon index ($\Gamma =2.43 \pm 0.21$), and a significant radio counterpart detected with VLA/FIRST 1.4 GHz and VLASS 3 GHz bands. The rest-frame UV to optical spectra from SDSS and Subaru/MOIRCS $J$-band show a dust reddened quasar feature with $A_\mathrm{V} = 0.39 \pm 0.08$ mag and the expected bolometric AGN luminosity from the dust-extinction-corrected UV luminosity reaches $L_\mathrm{bol,3000}= (7.62 \pm 0.31) \times 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We estimate the black hole mass of $M_\mathrm{BH} = (4.40 \pm 0.72) \times 10^{8} M_{\odot}$ based on the MgII$\lambda$2800 emission line width, and an Eddington ratio from the dust-extinction-corrected UV continuum luminosity reaches $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd,UV}=1.44 \pm 0.24$ and $\lambda_{\mathrm{Edd,X}} = 12.8 \pm 3.9$ from the X-ray luminosity, both indicating the super-Eddington accretion. ID830 shows a high ratio of UV-to-X-ray luminosities, $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}=-1.20 \pm 0.07$ (or $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}=-1.42 \pm 0.07$ after correcting for jet-linked X-ray excess), higher than quasars and little red dots in super-Eddington phase with similar UV luminosities, with $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}<-1.8$. Such a high $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}$ suggests the coexistence of a prominent radio jet and X-ray corona, in this high Eddington accretion phase. We propose that ID830 may be in a transitional phase after an accretion burst, evolving from a super-Eddington to a sub-Eddington state, which could naturally describe the high $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}$.         |

|**Abstract**|            WASP-69b and KELT-11b are two low-density hot Jupiters, which are expected to show strong atmospheric features in their transmission spectra. Such features offer valuable insights into the chemical composition, thermal structure, and cloud properties of exoplanet atmospheres. High-resolution spectroscopic observations can be used to study the line-forming regions in exoplanet atmospheres and potentially detect signals despite the presence of clouds. We aimed to detect various molecular species and constrain the chemical abundances and cloud deck pressures using high-resolution spectroscopy. We observed multiple transits of these planets with CARMENES and applied the cross-correlation method to detect atmospheric signatures. Further, we used an injection-recovery approach and retrievals to place constraints on the atmospheric properties. We detected a tentative H$_2$O signal for KELT-11b but not for WASP-69b, and searches for other molecules such as H$_2$S and CH$_4$ resulted in non-detections for both planets. By investigating the signal strength of injected synthetic models, we constrained which atmospheric abundances and cloud deck pressures are consistent with our cross-correlation results. In addition, we show that a retrieval-based approach leads to similar constraints of these parameters.         |

|**Abstract**|            Determining the structure of the Milky Way is essential for understanding its morphology, dynamics, and evolution. However, studying its innermost regions is challenging due to high extinction and crowding. The detection of a double red clump (RC; core-helium-burning stars) feature at very low Galactic latitudes suggests the presence of a spiral arm beyond the Galactic bar, providing new insights into the Galaxy's structure along this complex line of sight. We evaluate this possibility by analysing the proper motion and extinction distributions of the detected RC features. We constructed proper motion and extinction difference maps to investigate the kinematic and reddening properties of the RC populations, and the kinematic differences were validated using N-body simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy. We find that the two RC features are kinematically distinct, with a relative proper motion difference of $-0.16\pm0.02\, mas/yr$ in the component parallel to the Galactic plane. This difference can be explained by Galactic rotation if the two RCs lie at different distances, consistent with the simulations. The extinction towards the secondary RC is also $\sim0.05$ mag higher than that of the primary RC. Additionally, we estimate that the extinction difference between the RC features corresponds to only $\sim5\%$ of the total extinction from Earth to the first RC, suggesting little interstellar material between the farthest edge of the Galactic bar and the kinematically distinct structure traced by the secondary RC. Using $JK_s$ photometry, we derive $A_J/A_{K_s}=3.34\pm0.07$, consistent with previous results and showing no significant variation across fields or along the line of sight. The results support the secondary clump tracing a distant structure, possibly a spiral arm, although we cannot exclude that the population belongs to the disc.         |

|| L. He, et al. -- incl., <mark>J. Li</mark> |

|**Abstract**|            The detection of GW231123, a gravitational-wave (GW) event with exceptionally massive and rapidly spinning black holes, suggests the possible formation within an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk, which provides a favorable environment for potentially generating an observable electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. We conduct a search for such a counterpart by crossmatching the GW localization with a comprehensive catalog of AGN flares from the Zwicky Transient Facility. Our analysis yields six plausible optical flare candidates that are spatially and temporally coincident with GW231123 and exhibit significant deviations from their AGN baseline flux. Although these candidates represent a crucial first step, their true nature remains inconclusive. Confirming any one of these flares via future observations would provide a landmark validation of the AGN formation channel and unlock the multi-messenger potential of this extraordinary merger.         |
