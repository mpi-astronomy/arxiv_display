|**Abstract**| Varying oxygen abundance could impact the modeling-inferred ages. This work aims to estimate the ages of dwarfs considering observed oxygen abundance. To characterize 67,503 LAMOST and 4,006 GALAH FGK-type dwarf stars, we construct a grid of stellar models which take into account oxygen abundance as an independent model input. Compared with ages determined with commonly-used $\alpha$-enhanced models, we find a difference of $\sim$9% on average when the observed oxygen abundance is considered. The age differences between the two types of models are correlated to [Fe/H] and [O/$\alpha$], and they are relatively significant on stars with [Fe/H] $\lesssim$ -0.6 dex. Generally, varying 0.2 dex in [O/$\alpha$] will alter the age estimates of metal-rich (-0.2 $<$ [Fe/H] $<$ 0.2) stars by $\sim$10%, and relatively metal-poor (-1 $<$ [Fe/H] $<$ -0.2) stars by $\sim$15%. Of the low-O stars with [Fe/H] $<$ 0.1 dex and [O/$\alpha$] $\sim$ -0.2 dex, many have fractional age differences of $\geq$ 10%, and even reach up to 27%. The fractional age difference of high-O stars with [O/$\alpha$] $\sim$ 0.4 dex reaches up to -33% to -42% at [Fe/H] $\lesssim$ -0.6 dex. We also analyze the chemical properties of these stars. We find a decreasing trend of [Fe/H] with age from 7.5-9 Gyr to 5-6.5 Gyr for the stars from the LAMOST and GALAH. The [O/Fe] of these stars increases with decreasing age from 7.5-9 Gyr to 3-4 Gyr, indicating that the younger population is more O-rich. |

|**Abstract**| The Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) is currently the only sky survey providing optical ($ugri$) plus near-infrared (NIR, $ZYHJK_S$) seeing matched photometry over an area larger than 1000 $\rm deg^2$. This is obtained by incorporating the NIR data from the VISTA Kilo Degree Infrared Galaxy (VIKING) survey, covering the same KiDS footprint. As such, the KiDS multi-wavelength photometry represents a unique dataset to test the ability of stellar population models to return robust photometric stellar mass ($M_*$) and star-formation rate (SFR) estimates. Here we use a spectroscopic sample of galaxies for which we possess $u g r i Z Y J H K_s$ ``gaussianized'' magnitudes from KiDS data release 4. We fit the spectral energy distribution from the 9-band photometry using: 1) three different popular libraries of stellar {population} templates, 2) single burst, simple and delayed exponential star-formation history models, and 3) a wide range of priors on age and metallicity. As template fitting codes we use two popular softwares: LePhare and CIGALE. We investigate the variance of the stellar masses and the star-formation rates from the different combinations of templates, star formation recipes and codes to assess the stability of these estimates and define some ``robust'' median quantities to be included in the upcoming KiDS data releases. As a science validation test, we derive the mass function, the star formation rate function, and the SFR-$M_*$ relation for a low-redshift ($z<0.5$) sample of galaxies, that result in excellent agreement with previous literature data. The final catalog, containing $\sim290\,000$ galaxies with redshift $0.01<z<0.9$, is made publicly available. |

|| Y. Shao, et al. -- incl., <mark>X. Zhang</mark> |

|**Abstract**| The absorption features in spectra of high-redshift background radio sources, caused by hyperfine structure lines of hydrogen atoms in the intervening structures, are known collectively as the 21-cm forest. They provide a unique probe of small-scale structures during the epoch of reionization, and can be used to constrain the properties of the dark matter (DM) thought to govern small-scale structure formation. However, the signals are easily suppressed by heating processes that are degenerate with a warm DM model. Here we propose a probe of both the DM particle mass and the heating history of the Universe, using the one-dimensional power spectrum of the 21-cm forest. The one-dimensional power spectrum measurement not only breaks the DM model degeneracy but also increases the sensitivity, making the probe actually feasible. Making 21-cm forest observations with the upcoming Square Kilometre Array has the potential to simultaneously determine both the DM particle mass and the heating level in the early Universe, shedding light on the nature of DM and the first galaxies. |
