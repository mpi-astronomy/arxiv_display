|**Abstract**| The European Space Agency's Euclid mission is one of the upcoming generation of large-scale cosmology surveys, which will map the large-scale structure in the Universe with unprecedented precision. The development and validation of the SGS pipeline requires state-of-the-art simulations with a high level of complexity and accuracy that include subtle instrumental features not accounted for previously as well as faster algorithms for the large-scale production of the expected Euclid data products. In this paper, we present the Euclid SGS simulation framework as applied in a large-scale end-to-end simulation exercise named Science Challenge 8. Our simulation pipeline enables the swift production of detailed image simulations for the construction and validation of the Euclid mission during its qualification phase and will serve as a reference throughout operations. Our end-to-end simulation framework starts with the production of a large cosmological N-body & mock galaxy catalogue simulation. We perform a selection of galaxies down to I_E=26 and 28 mag, respectively, for a Euclid Wide Survey spanning 165 deg^2 and a 1 deg^2 Euclid Deep Survey. We build realistic stellar density catalogues containing Milky Way-like stars down to H<26. Using the latest instrumental models for both the Euclid instruments and spacecraft as well as Euclid-like observing sequences, we emulate with high fidelity Euclid satellite imaging throughout the mission's lifetime. We present the SC8 data set consisting of overlapping visible and near-infrared Euclid Wide Survey and Euclid Deep Survey imaging and low-resolution spectroscopy along with ground-based. This extensive data set enables end-to-end testing of the entire ground segment data reduction and science analysis pipeline as well as the Euclid mission infrastructure, paving the way to future scientific and technical developments and enhancements. |

|**Abstract**| We present a comprehensive analysis of the Hubble Space Telescope observations of the atmosphere of WASP-121 b, a ultra-hot Jupiter. After reducing the transit, eclipse, and phase-curve observations with a uniform methodology and addressing the biases from instrument systematics, sophisticated atmospheric retrievals are used to extract robust constraints on the thermal structure, chemistry, and cloud properties of the atmosphere. Our analysis shows that the observations are consistent with a strong thermal inversion beginning at ~0.1 bar on the dayside, solar to subsolar metallicity Z (i.e., -0.77 < log(Z) < 0.05), and super-solar C/O ratio (i.e., 0.59 < C/O < 0.87). More importantly, utilizing the high signal-to-noise ratio and repeated observations of the planet, we identify the following unambiguous time-varying signals in the data: i) a shift of the putative hotspot offset between the two phase-curves and ii) varying spectral signatures in the transits and eclipses. By simulating the global dynamics of WASP-121 b atmosphere at high-resolution, we show that the identified signals are consistent with quasi-periodic weather patterns, hence atmospheric variability, with signatures at the level probed by the observations (~5% to ~10%) that change on a timescale of ~5 planet days; in the simulations, the weather patterns arise from the formation and movement of storms and fronts, causing hot (as well as cold) patches of atmosphere to deform, separate, and mix in time. |

|**Abstract**| To gain a better understanding of the Andromeda galaxy M31 and its role in the Local Group, measuring its mass precisely is essential. In this work, we have constructed the rotation curve of M31 out to $\sim$125 kpc using 13,679 M31 objects obtained from various sources, including the LAMOST data release 9 (LAMOST DR9), the DESI survey, and relevant literature. We divide all objects in our sample into bulge, disk and halo components. For the sources in the M31 disk, we have measured their circular velocities by a kinematic model with asymmetric drift corrections. For the bulge and halo objects, we calculate their velocity dispersions and use the spherical and projected Jeans equation to obtain the circular velocities. Our findings indicate a nearly isotropic nature for the M31 bulge, while the halo exhibits tangential anisotropy. The results show that the rotation curve remains constant at $\sim$220 km s$^{-1}$ up to radius $\sim$25 kpc and gradually decreases to $\sim$170 km s$^{-1}$ further out. Based on the newly determined rotation curve, we have constructed a mass distribution model for M31. Our measurement of the M31 virial mass is $M_{\rm vir} = 1.14^{+0.51}_{-0.35} \times 10^{12} M_\odot$ within $r_{\rm vir} = 220 \pm 25$ kpc. |

|**Abstract**| High-energy photons may oscillate with axion-like particles (ALPs) when they propagate through the Milky Way's magnetic field, resulting in an alteration in the observed photon energy spectrum. The ultra-high energy gamma-ray spectra, measured by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) up to $\mathcal{O}(1)~\mathrm{PeV}$, provide a promising opportunity to investigate the ALP-photon oscillation effect. In this study, we utilize the gamma-ray spectra of four Galactic sources measured by LHAASO, including the Crab Nebula, LHAASO J2226+6057, LHAASO J1908+0621, and LHAASO J1825-1326, to explore this effect. We employ the $\rm CL_s$ method to set constraints on the ALP parameters. Combing the observations of the four sources, our analysis reveals that the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ is constrained to be smaller than $1.4\times10^{-10}$ ${\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for the ALP mass of $\sim 4\times10^{-7} ~\mathrm{eV}$ at the 95\% C.L. By combing the observations of the Crab Nebula from LHAASO and other experiments, we find that the ALP-photon coupling could be set to be about $7.2\times10^{-11}$ ${\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for the ALP mass $\sim 4 \times10^{-7}~\mathrm{eV}$ , which is in close proximity to the CAST constraint. |
