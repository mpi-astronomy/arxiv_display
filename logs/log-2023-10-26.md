|**Abstract**| We report the discovery of SDSS~J022932.28+713002.7, a nascent extremely low-mass (ELM) white dwarf (WD) orbiting a massive ($> 1\,M_\odot$ at 2$\sigma$ confidence) companion with a period of 36 hours. We use a combination of spectroscopy, including data from the ongoing SDSS-V survey, and photometry to measure the stellar parameters for the primary pre-ELM white dwarf. The lightcurve of the primary WD exhibits ellipsoidal variation, which we combine with radial velocity data and $\tt{PHOEBE}$ binary simulations to estimate the mass of the invisible companion. We find that the primary WD has mass $M_1$ = $0.18^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ M$_\odot$ and the unseen secondary has mass $M_2$ = $1.19^{+0.21}_{-0.14}$ M$_\odot$. The mass of the companion suggests that it is most likely a near-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf or a neutron star. It is likely that the system recently went through a Roche lobe overflow from the visible primary onto the invisible secondary. The dynamical configuration of the binary is consistent with the theoretical evolutionary tracks for such objects, and the primary is currently in its contraction phase. The measured orbital period puts this system on a stable evolutionary path which, within a few Gyrs, will lead to a contracted ELM white dwarf orbiting a massive compact companion. |

|**Abstract**| Long-period comet C/2020 S3 (Erasmus) reached perihelion at 0.398 au on UT 2020 December 12.67, making it a bright, near-Sun object. Images taken between mid-November and December 2020 using the HI-1 camera and COR2 coronagraph onboard STEREO-A, as well as the LASCO/C3 coronagraph onboard SoHO, show significant variations in the plasma tail position angles. To analyze these variations, a simple technique was developed to calculate the aberration angles. These angles are defined as the angle between the sun-comet line and the tail axis, measured in the orbital plane. The aberration angles were found to range from $1.2^\circ$ to $46.8^\circ$, with an average (median) value of approximately $20.3^\circ$ ($16.3^\circ$). By considering the aberration angles, the solar wind radial velocities during the observations were inferred to range from 73.9 km/s to 573.5 km/s, with mean (median) values of approximately 205.5 km/s (182.3 km/s). Throughout the observations, two periods were identified where the tails showed forward tilting, which cannot be explained by aberration alone. In one case, this anomalous position angle was sustained for at least 11 days and is possibly due to co-rotating interaction regions. In the other case, the tail exhibited dramatic excursions from 180$^\circ$ to 150$^\circ$ back to 210$^\circ$ over a limited period of around 34 hours. This behavior is tentatively explained as a consequence of the interaction with a halo Coronal Mass Ejection that was launched from NOAA 12786 and arrived at comet C/2020 S3 during the time when the tail displayed its wagging behavior. |

|**Abstract**| Peptide-like molecule, which has a close connection with the origin of life, has been detected in universe. Mapping observations of HCONH$_2$ and CH$_3$CONH$_2$, two simplest peptide-like molecules, are performed towards Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2) complex with the IRAM 30m telescope. Seven transitions of HCONH$_2$ and five transitions of CH$_3$CONH$_2$ are used in analysis. The spatial distribution of excitation temperature and column density of HCONH$_2$ in the molecular envelope of Sgr B2 are obtained by the rotation diagrams. Assuming the same excitation temperature as HCONH$_2$, the column densities of CH$_3$CONH$_2$ are also calculated. The results show that excitation temperature ranges from 6 K to 46 K in the molecular envelope of Sgr B2. The abundance ratio between HCONH$_2$ and CH$_3$CONH$_2$ are calculated to explore the relationship among them, as well as HNCO mentioned in our pervious research. The abundance ratio of CH$_3$CONH$_2$/HCONH$_2$ varies from 10% to 20%, while that of HCONH$_2$/HNCO ranges from 1.5% to 10%. CH$_3$CONH$_2$ is enhanced with respect to HCONH$_2$ in the northwest region of Sgr B2. One transition of H$^{13}$CONH$_2$ is detected toward 12 positions of Sgr B2, from which a $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of 28.7 is obtained. A time-dependent chemical model with a short duration of X-ray burst is used to explain the observed abundances of HCONH$_2$ and CH$_3$CONH$_2$, with the best fitting result at T$\rm_{dust}$ = 53-56 K. More chemical reactions are required to be included into the model since the modeled abundance is lower than the observed one at the observed T$\rm_{dust}$. |
