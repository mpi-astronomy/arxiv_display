**Abstract:** The Galactic Center (GC) is an extreme region of the Milky Way that is host to a complex set of thermal and non-thermal structures. In particular, the GC contains high-density gas and dust that is collectively referred to as the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). In this work, we study a subset of HNCO filaments identified in band 3 ALMA observations of the GC obtained by the ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES) that are comparable to high density filaments identified in the Galactic Disk. We compare the orientation of the magnetic field derived from 214 $\mu$ m SOFIA and 850 $\mu$ m JCMT observations with the filament orientation to deftermine which mechanisms dominate the formation of these filaments. We observe a large range of magnetic orientations in our observed filaments indicating the complex environments the filaments are located in. We also compare the observational results to synthetic data sets created using an MHD model of the GC. Our analysis reveals that the dominant mechanisms local to the HNCO filaments vary throughout the GC with some filaments being dominated by supersonic turbulence and others by subsonic turbulence. The comparison to synthetic observations indicates that the observed filaments are in magnetically dominated environments that could be supporting these filaments against collapse. Our results on the CMZ filaments are also compared to results obtained on similar filaments located in the Galactic Disk, and we find that the filaments studied here are possible CMZ analogs to the dense filamentary "bones" observed previously in the Galactic Disk.

**Figure 8. -** The relative orientation (left panel) and alignment measure (right panel) distributions obtained for the full set of targeted LFs studied using the 214 $\mu$m FIREPLACE observations. In the left panel, dashed and dotted lines show projected relative angles for intrinsic 3D angles of 20◦ee to 60◦ee and 75◦ee to 90◦ee, respectively. The red histogram is a 7:3 mix of these distributions, matching the bimodal pattern in the data. (*fig:RO_dist_SOFIA_RHT*)

**Figure 5. -** The final RHT distribution used to identify filamentary structures in the ACES HNCO distribution. We show the RHT distribution obtained from the HNCO distribution that has been convolved to the 19.6$\arcsec$ FIREPLACE beam size. The black contour traces the cool dust traced by the FIREPLACE 214 $\mu$m observations at a level of 6 Jy pixel$^{-1}$ and indicates the CMZ molecular clouds that have been masked out. The boxes indicate the locations of the filaments that are targeted for a detailed analysis in this work. Blue boxes indicate filaments that coincide with  only FIREPLACE magnetic field orientations and green boxes indicate filaments that coincide with both FIREPLACE and BISTRO magnetic field orientations. In addition, red and orange boxes indicate the filaments previously studied in Battersby et al. (submitted) where the red boxes coincide with only FIREPLACE magnetic field orientations and the orange box coincides with both FIREPLACE and BISTRO magnetic field orientations. The filaments studied within each of these regions are shown in Figures \ref{fig:hro_rht_sofia_fig1} and \ref{fig:hro_rht_sofia_fig2}. (*fig:fil_map*)

**Figure 11. -** Observed relative orientation and alignment measure (AM) results obtained for individual LFs compared to the 12$\arcsec$ BISTRO (850 $\mu$m) magnetic field in the CMZ located in regions 2, 4, and 5. Left column: the HNCO intensity of the LFs with the non-filamentary emission surrounding the LFs masked out. Thicker red dashes indicate the BISTRO magnetic field vectors used to calculate the AM values. Middle column: the histogram or relative orientations between the BISTRO magnetic field orientation and the LF orientation. Right column: the AM measure results obtained for each LF studied.
